Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the period ended 29 March 2015 For the period ended 29 March 2015 1 General information Synergy Health plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group deliver a range of specialist outsourced services to healthcare providers and other customers concerned with health management.
The Company is registered in the United Kingdom under company registration number 3355631 and its registered office is Ground Floor Stella, Windmill Hill Business Park, Whitehill Way, Swindon, Wilts SN5 6NX.
The financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 102 to 110.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to the nearest weekend to 31 March each year.
The current accounting period is 52 weeks in length 2014: 52 weeks in length.
Basis of consolidation: Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Changes in the Groups interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity.
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Joint arrangements and associates A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
These joint arrangements are in turn classified as either a joint venture where the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities: or a joint operation, where the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Where the Group is a party to a joint operation, the consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the joint operations assets and liabilities, as well as the Groups share of the entitys profit or loss and other comprehensive income, on a line-by-line basis.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies set out below.
Going concern In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements the Directors have considered the Groups business activities as set out in the strategic review and regional review, the financial position of the Group and its cash flows and borrowing requirements as set out in the Finance Directors review, and the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 22 to 26.
Based on the Groups cash flow forecasts and projections, the Board is satisfied that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its facilities for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Provisional fair value allocations are reviewed and if necessary adjusted no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of services.
The services rendered are discrete and routine in nature and are typically completed in a short period of time.
Revenue is recognised once the service has been completed and where goods are supplied once the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer.
The Group does not participate in activities that give rise to the need to make judgements over the stage of completion of a particular service for the purposes of recognising revenue.
Non-recurring items Non-recurring income and expenses are those items that are one-off in nature and create significant volatility in reported earnings and are therefore reported separately in the income statement.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Finance charges and income Interest charges and income are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense by reference to the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for that year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Furthermore, as the Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are complex and can take several years to conclude, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge of historical tax positions.
As amounts provided in any year could differ from the eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments may arise which may have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash payments.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved and paid.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired by the Group are initially capitalised at fair value as at the date of the acquisition, and subsequently stated at carrying value less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer-related intangibles 515 years Trade names 10 years Costs incurred in setting up long-term agreements are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the life of the contract to which the costs relate.
Technology licences are amortised from the date that they generate economic benefit and over the period of that benefit.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings The Groups policy is not to revalue property for accounting purposes.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of tangible non-current assets excluding cobalt, less estimated residual values, over their estimated useful lives in equal annual instalments as follows: Freehold land Not depreciated Plant and machinery 320 years Freehold property 50 years Office equipment 35 years Leasehold improvements Period of lease Cobalt 15 years Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated Circulating inventory 15 years Cobalt is depreciated over 15 years: the reducing balance method is used for the first eight years, then the residual net book value is depreciated on a straight-line basis over seven years.
This method has been selected to align the depreciation charge with the radioactive decay profile of the cobalt-60 isotope.
Potential decommissioning costs are also capitalised and amortised over 15 years.
A corresponding provision is recognised in the balance sheet on acquisition.
Circulating inventory mainly comprises linen textile assets provided to customers on a rental service basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
During the year, management reassessed the useful economic lives of certain assets to establish consistency across the Group.
The net impact of this change in accounting estimate was a recurring and sustainable decrease of 4.3% to the Groups depreciation charge.
Assets held under leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment in value is recognised in the income statement.

Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the buildings over 50 years.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets which arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a third party, and where there is no intention of trading the financial asset.
The receivables are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when objective evidence is received that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are netted off against cash.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these exposures.
Some of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows or against net investment in overseas subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not clearly related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
74 74 S Syner ynerg gy Health pl y Health plc Annual c Annual R Rep epo ort an rt and Accounts 2015 d Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement.
In order to manage its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see above for the details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 3 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value of each award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The level of vesting is reviewed annually: the charge is adjusted to reflect actual and estimated levels of vesting.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model except for the Long Term Incentive Plan awards which are subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition where a model following similar principles to the Monte Carlo approach is used.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Where estimates and associated assumptions are made they are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Key areas of judgement, and estimate uncertainty, are set out below.
Impairment tests have been undertaken with respect to goodwill note 11 using commercial judgement and a number of assumptions and estimates have been made to support their carrying amounts.
Sensitivity analysis as at 29 March 2015 has indicated that no reasonable foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model will result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
In addition, a more detailed review has been carried out on certain Group assets, focusing on whether these assets required impairment.
Following the review, no impairment was judged to be required.
The designation of certain items of income and of cost as non-recurring in nature, and their separate disclosure as such in the primary statements of the Groups consolidated accounts.
The recognition of certain contingent transaction costs and their assessed likelihood to materialise, as measured against known delivery milestones.
In relation to the Groups property, plant and equipment note 13, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
In relation to the Groups cobalt provision, costs of future disposal are based on contractual arrangements with third parties and latest disposal cost estimates.
The Groups cobalt depreciation policy is based on the actual physical decay of the cobalt-60 isotope.
In relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, actuarial assumptions are established using relevant market benchmark data and with the advice of external qualified actuaries.
Pension deficit valuations are most sensitive to changes in the underlying discount rate and inflation assumptions.
Customer-related intangibles that are acquired as part of an acquisition are valued based on the forecast discounted cash flows arising from these customers taking account of historically observed customer attrition rates.
The Group operates in a number of countries, all of which have their own tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the current tax rate which may not be the tax rate at which they unwind.
The Group has available tax losses, some of which have been recognised and some of which have not, based upon managements judgement of the ability of the Group to utilise those losses.

As set out in note 3 there was a restructuring of the Groups internal reorganisation on 1 April 2014 and goodwill has been reallocated to reflect this.
The reallocation has been made based on the service line to which the goodwill was most closely associated with and the allocation is as shown below.
This table also provides the assumptions used by management in assessing the carrying value of these amounts.
2015 2014 MidPerpetuity Pre-tax term Pre-tax Mid-term Perpetuity discount growth discount growth growth growth rate rates rate rates rates rates % % % 000 % % % 000 AST segment 7.9 5 to 10 2.0 161,696 UK & Ireland segment 8.2 8.0 2.0 61,955 HS segment 8.2 5 to 10 2.0 28,531 Europe & Middle east segment 8.1 4.0 2.0 117,101 HCS segment 8.2 2 to 5 2.0 24,318 Americas segment 8.3 10.0 2.0 15,558 Asia & Africa segment 8.3 8.0 2.0 21,632 214,545 216,246 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a segment to their recoverable amount based on a value in use calculation.
An impairment results where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
During the year the goodwill for each segment was separately assessed and tested for impairment, with nil 2014: nil impairment charges resulting.
In addition, as described in the Audit Committee report on page 39, a more detailed review has been carried out on certain Group assets, focusing on whether these assets required impairment.
As part of testing goodwill for impairment, detailed forecasts of operating cash flows for a period of five years are derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management.
Cash flows for the period beyond the financial forecasts are extrapolated based on estimates of future growth rates as disclosed above.
For each segment the future growth rates used in the recoverable amount calculation do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets to which each segment is dedicated.
Discount rates have been calculated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the segment.
In determining the discount rate management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The discount rates applied to each specific cash-generating unit are set out in the table above.
A number of key assumptions are used as part of impairment testing.
These key assumptions are made by management reflecting past experience combined with their knowledge as to future performance and relevant external sources of information.
In determining the recoverable amount of each segment the key assumptions are discount rate, mid and long-term growth rate, future sales prices and volumes, new business won and the cost structure of each business.
Sensitivity analysis performed on these key assumptions did not reveal any reasonably possible change which could result in recoverable amounts falling below carrying amounts.

18 Financial instruments Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, with the exception of contingent consideration which is measured by a Level 3 valuation method.
a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
b Interest rate risk The Group is subject to fluctuations in interest rates on its loans and surplus cash deposits.
At 29 March 2015 and 30 March 2014 the Group held hedging arrangements in order to fix the interest charge on $35.0 million of its bank debt.
The swap arrangements cover: Debt covered Fixed rate Expiry $35 million 2.5% 31 March 2016 Amounts to be paid or received under these arrangements will be recognised in the interest expense consistent with the terms of the agreement.
The expiry of each agreement is disclosed in the table above.
The arrangements are fully effective in fixing the interest on the underlying debt.
In revaluing them to fair value, the Group has recognised 623,000 2014: 830,000 in current liabilities and equity, net of the associated deferred tax amount.
86 86 S Syner ynerg gy Health pl y Health plc Annual c Annual R Rep epo ort an rt and Accounts 2015 d Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 18 Financial instruments continued b Interest rate risk continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the element of the total Group interest which is not subject to fixed interest arrangements.
The reasonable change is based on the difference between current market interest rates and two year forward rates: Increase decrease Effect on profit after in basis points tax and equity 000 2015 5 5 52 52 2014 32 32 261 261 c Foreign currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to fluctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro and between Sterling and the US Dollar.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the proportion of interest cost in each currency is consistent with the proportion of earnings in that currency.
By arranging its affairs in this manner, the Group seeks to ensure that there is no disproportionate impact on its results as a result of exchange rate movements.
During the 12 months to March 2015 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro strengthened by 8% in comparison with the 12 month average to March 2014.
An 8% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro over the entire year to March 2015 would have resulted in decreased adjusted operating profit of 1.9 million 2014: a 3% strengthening, which would have led to an increase of 0.8 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
An 8% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro would have an equal but opposite effect.
During the 12 months to March 2015 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar has strengthened by 1% in comparison to the 12 month average to March 2014.
A 1% weakening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar over the entire year to March 2015 would have resulted in reduced adjusted operating profit of 0.1 million 2014: a 1% weakening, which would have led to a reduction of 0.0 million.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
A 1% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar would have an equal but opposite effect.
Where the Group subsidiaries make significant purchases in non-functional currencies, such as US and Canadian Dollars, the Group enters into forward exchange currency contracts to manage this exposure.
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows in foreign currencies and is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in the functional currencies of the Groups trading entities and its suppliers.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge-specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the underlying hedged item until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Additionally, the Group holds net Euro and US Dollar denominated loans in UK companies totalling 72.7 million and 87.4 million respectively 2014: 76.3 million and 67.1 million respectively.
This represents a fully effective designated net investment hedge against the first 72.7 million of the Groups Euro denominated net assets of 129.2 million and 87.4 million of the Groups US Dollar denominated net assets of 127.4 million 2014: 76.3 million of 133.2 million and 67.1 million of 76.6 million.
The revaluation of these loans resulted in a gain of 4.7 million 2014: gain of 2.0 million which has been posted to the translation reserve.
d Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for impairment.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor exposure to risk on an ongoing basis.
These include the use of customer-specific credit limits based on third party credit reports and in cases of customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery.
Given these factors and based on extensive past experience, the Group believes that its financial assets are of good credit quality.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was 102,827,000 2014: 89,963,000 being the total trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
The Groups customer base mainly comprises major medical device companies, commercial distributors, NHS Trusts and healthcare providers, including public sector, private sector and charitable organisations, throughout the world.

The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year is 6.45 2014: 2.38.
The fair value of an award of shares under the LTIP has been adjusted to take into account Total Shareholder Return TSR as a market-based performance condition, using a pricing model that takes into account expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the comparator group.
The model follows similar principles as the Monte Carlo approach and takes into account that TSR vesting and share price performance are not independent.
The inputs into the fair value models are as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted average share price 14.05 11.16 Weighted average exercise price 0.01 0.01 Expected volatility 18.00% 17.60% Expected life in years 3.0 3.0 Risk free rate 1.46% 0.62% Dividend yield 1.94% 1.93% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years at the date of grant.

In addition, the Group participates in a multi-employer scheme in the Netherlands.
These schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: market investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk currency risk and longevity risk.
They do not expose the Group to any unusual scheme-specific or Group-specific risks.

Each is a separate trustee administered fund holding the pension scheme assets to meet long-term pension liabilities for past and present employees as at 31 March 2012.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on the final pensionable salary prior to leaving active service, and is linked to changes in inflation up to retirement.
The schemes are subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005.
This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial Reporting Council, set out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension schemes in the UK.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of the trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
A full actuarial valuation of each scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2012 in accordance with the scheme funding requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and the funding of the schemes is agreed between the Group and the trustees in line with those requirements.
These in particular require the surplus deficit to be calculated using prudent, as opposed to best estimate, actuarial assumptions.
For the purposes of IAS 19 the actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2012, which were carried out by a qualified independent actuary, have been updated on an approximate basis to 29 March 2015.
There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this periods disclosures compared with the previous periods disclosures.
The present value of scheme liabilities is measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The value calculated in this way is reflected in the net liability in the balance sheet as shown above.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which allowance is made for projected earnings increases.
The accumulated benefit obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the scheme liabilities, whose calculation differs from that under the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumption for future earnings increases.
In assessing this figure for the purpose of these disclosures, allowance has been made for future statutory revaluation of benefits up to retirement.
A further measure of the scheme liabilities is the solvency basis, often taken as an estimate of the cost of buying out the benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities rather than the Company continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme.
All actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in the year in which they occur in other comprehensive income.
The Company has reviewed the implications of the guidance provided by IFRIC 14 and has concluded that it is not necessary to make any adjustments to the IAS 19 figures in respect of an asset ceiling or Minimum Funding Requirement as at 29 March 2015.
Allowance has been made for a pension increase exchange being introduced as an option at retirement in the scheme during the year.
The corresponding impact has been recognised as a curtailment gain in the income statement.
UK scheme-specific disclosures Synergy Health plc Retirement Benefits Scheme: The scheme is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
Participation in this scheme is only offered to employees transferring their employment from NHS Trusts.
The latest actuarial valuation showed a deficit of 2,348,000.
The Group has agreed with the trustees that it will aim to eliminate the deficit over a period of 6 years and 9 months from 1 April 2013 by the payment of annual contributions of 348,000 payable quarterly, in respect of the deficit increasing by 3% each year.

The Netherlands scheme In previous years, the Group has sponsored a funded defined benefit arrangement in the Netherlands.
This was a separate fund holding the pension scheme assets to meet long term pension liabilities for past and present employees.
From 1 January 2013 accrual ceased under the scheme.
The scheme is not subject to the UK legislation related to valuation of occupational pension schemes.
For the purposes of IAS 19 the actuarial valuation as at 30 March 2014, has been updated to 29 March 2015.
The present value of plan liabilities is measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the defined accrued benefit method.
Other schemes Synergy Radeberg and Synergy Alleshausen Schemes: These schemes are defined benefit funded pension schemes, closed to new entrants.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 29 March 2015 by a qualified independent actuary, independent of the schemes sponsoring employer.
Synergy Daniken previously LSH Scheme: The scheme is a defined benefit funded pension scheme.
Bioster S. p. A: Our Italian business has an obligation under Italian Trattamento di Fine Rapporto TFR rules to pay deferred salary to staff when their employment ends.
This obligation applies only to staff employed before 2007.
The Group recognised 460,000 within non-current liabilities for this post-employment benefit.
Lips Textielservice: Our Dutch linen business participates in a multi-employer industry-wide defined benefit scheme the Textile Industry Pension Fund.
Participation in this pension plan is mandatory.
The pension scheme is an average pay scheme with a conditional fee indexation.
Indexation of the assets and liabilities granted under the pension scheme takes place only if and insofar as the resources of the fund allow for it and this decision is taken by the pension fund.
The pension entitlements under the pension plan are fully reinsured.
The pension scheme is classified as a defined benefit agreement.
The main agreements included in the pension plan are as follows: Pensionable salary is limited to a maximum, which is adjusted annually based on developments of the applicable legislation Pension Law : The premium payable shall, in consultation with the administration of the fund and Collective Labour agreement parties, be set no lower than a cost-effective premium: In adopting higher than the cost-effective contribution, the fund may utilise the surplus for additional buffering under a recovery plan, or additional funding for future indexation, or for other purposes as described in the actuarial and business report of the fund: The fund may only apply discounts to the cost-effective premium if the pension obligations comply with the requirements of the Pension Law: In the event of a reserve deficit, the fund may, under specific circumstances, decide to reduce the pension entitlements and rights.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets, liabilities, and overall surplus deficit of the scheme attributable to the business, because the scheme is industry-wide.
Under the specific exemptions within IAS 19, the scheme is therefore treated as a defined contribution scheme within the Group financial statements.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of this scheme was 1,934,000 2014: 2,044,000.

The scheme assets do not include investments issued by the Group nor any properties occupied by the Group.
The overall expected rate of return on the scheme assets has been based on the average expected return for each asset class, weighted by the amount of assets in each class.
All assets have a quoted market price in an active market with the exception of the cash and other assets.
Key weighted average assumptions used by the actuary and the Directors for the significant pension schemes: 2015 2014 % % Rate of increase in salaries 2.5 2.2 Inflation 2.0 3.1 Discount rate for liabilities 3.2 4.2 The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, salary growth risk, mortality risk and longevity risk.
A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to scheme liabilities.
This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future P&L accounts.
This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
