114 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 15.
TAX Continued The tax charge for the year is different to the charge for the year derived by applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20.5% 2014: 22% to the profit before tax.
The differences are explained below: 2015 2014 m m Profit before tax 50.0 81.1 Profit before tax at a rate of 20.5% 2014: 22% 10.2 17.8 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 4.9 1.1 Share of joint ventures associates after tax 2.8 4.2 Other losses and non-taxable items 0.3 1.8 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 4.7 6.5 7.3 6.4 As shown above, deferred tax has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in relation to the actuarial gain or loss on the BPT Limited pension scheme and the fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments.
The tax effect is shown separately within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 81.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, a number of changes to the UK corporation tax system have been proposed.
Subsequent to the year end a further reduction in the main rate has been substantively enacted, reducing the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
This reduction has not been reflected in the deferred tax items in the balance sheet as it was not substantively enacted at the year end.
This change is therefore expected to reduce the net deferred tax liability of the Group in future periods.
DIVIDENDS Under IAS 10, final dividends are excluded from the statement of financial position either until they are approved by the Company in general meeting or until they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Companys discretion.
