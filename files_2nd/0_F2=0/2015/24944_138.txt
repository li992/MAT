Dividends on the HSBC Holdings non-cumulative dollar preference shares in issue dollar preference shares are paid quarterly at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors will not declare a dividend on the dollar preference shares if payment of the dividend would cause HSBC Holdings not to meet the applicable capital adequacy requirements of the PRA or the profit of HSBC Holdings available for distribution as dividends is not sufficient to enable HSBC Holdings to pay in full both dividends on the dollar preference shares and dividends on any other shares that are scheduled to be paid on the same date and that have an equal right to dividends.
HSBC Holdings may not declare or pay dividends on any class of its shares ranking lower in the right to dividends than the dollar preference shares nor redeem nor purchase in any manner any of its other shares ranking equal with or lower than the dollar preference shares unless it has paid in full, or set aside an amount to provide for payment in full, the dividends on the dollar preference shares for the then current dividend HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 437 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Notes on the Financial Statements continued 35 Share capital 36 Notes on the statement of cash flows period.

Holders of the dollar preference shares will only be entitled to attend and vote at general meetings of shareholders of HSBC Holdings if the dividend payable on the dollar preference shares has not been paid in full for four consecutive dividend payment dates.
In such circumstances, holders of the dollar preference shares will be entitled to vote on all matters put to general meetings until such time as HSBC Holdings has paid a full dividend on the dollar preference shares.
HSBC Holdings may redeem the dollar preference shares in whole at any time on or after 16 December 2010, subject to prior notification to the PRA.

The sterling preference share carries no rights of conversion into ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings and no rights to attend and vote at general meetings of shareholders of HSBC Holdings.
HSBC Holdings may redeem it in whole at any time at the option of the Company.
Other equity instruments HSBC has included three types of additional tier 1 capital securities in its tier 1 capital.
The two types of additional tier 1 securities presented in this Note are accounted for as equity because HSBC does not have an obligation to transfer cash or a variable number of its own ordinary shares to holders under any circumstances outside its control.
See Note 30 for additional tier 1 securities accounted for as liabilities.
Other equity instruments which have been included in the regulatory capital base of HSBC comprise additional tier 1 capital securities and additional tier 1 contingent convertible securities.
Additional tier 1 capital securities Additional tier 1 capital securities are perpetual subordinated securities on which coupon payments may be deferred at the discretion of HSBC Holdings.
While any coupon payments are unpaid or deferred, HSBC Holdings will not declare, pay dividends or make distributions or similar periodic payments in respect of, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of lower or equal rank.
Such securities do not generally carry voting rights but rank higher than ordinary shares for coupon payments and in the event of a winding-up.
These securities do not meet the identifying criteria in full for recognition as tier 1 capital under CRD IV but are eligible as regulatory capital subject to grandfathering limits and progressive phase-out.
At HSBC Holdings discretion, and subject to certain conditions being satisfied, the capital securities may be exchanged on any coupon payment date for non-cumulative preference shares to be issued by HSBC Holdings and ranking pari passu with the dollar and sterling preference shares in issue.
The preference shares would be issued at a nominal value of $0.01 per share and a premium of $24.99 per share, with both such amounts being subscribed and fully paid.
These securities may be called and redeemed by HSBC subject to prior notification to the PRA.

The net proceeds of the issuances will be used for general corporate purposes and to further strengthen the capital base pursuant to requirements under CRD IV.
These securities bear a fixed rate of interest until their initial call dates.
After the initial call dates, in the event they are not redeemed, the securities will bear interest at rates which are fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on prevailing market rates.
Interest on the contingent convertible securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of HSBC, and HSBC has sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel in whole or in part any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date.
There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations, or other requirements, if HSBC Holdings has insufficient reserves available for distribution or if HSBC fails to satisfy the solvency condition as defined in the securities terms.
The contingent convertible securities are undated and are repayable, at the option of HSBC, in whole at the initial call date, or on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date.
In addition, the securities are repayable at the option of HSBC in whole for certain regulatory or tax reasons.
Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA.
These securities rank pari passu with HSBCs dollar and sterling preference shares and are therefore ahead of ordinary shares.
The contingent convertible securities will be converted into fully paid ordinary shares of HSBC at a pre-determined price should HSBCs consolidated end point CET1 ratio fall below 7.0%.
Therefore, in accordance with the terms of the securities, if the end point CET1 ratio breaches the 7.0% trigger the securities will convert into ordinary shares at fixed contractual conversion prices in the issuance currencies of the HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 438
