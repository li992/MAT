8 FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework The Financial Reporting Council has issued FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements, FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Ireland.
These standards are applicable to all companies and entities in the UK and Republic of Ireland, other than listed groups which continue to report under IFRS, for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
FRS 100 sets out the overall financial reporting framework for companies in the UK and Ireland.
FRS 101 applies to the individual financial statements of subsidiaries and ultimate parents, allowing them to apply the same accounting policies as in their listed group accounts, but with fewer disclosures.
FRS 102 is a single financial reporting standard that applies to the financial statements of entities that are not applying IFRS, FRS 101 or the FRSSE.
The primary statements of entities applying FRS 101 or FRS 102 would continue to follow the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has adopted the accounting requirements of the reduced disclosure framework under FRS 101 in these financial statements, with a transition date of 1 January 2014.
Given that the Company previously applied the fair value provisions of historic UK GAAP, the adoption of FRS 101 had no material impact to previously reported amounts in profit or equity.
The Companys financial statements still meet the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 including giving a true and fair view of the Companys assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss.
This means the Company will therefore always be required to include in its accounts all information relevant to shareholders and necessary to show a true and fair view.
The Company is required to inform its shareholders and to provide a reasonable opportunity for its shareholders to object to the use of FRS 101.
A shareholder or shareholders holding in aggregate 5% or more of the total allotted shares in British American Tobacco p. l. c. may object to the Company applying the FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework to its individual financial statements by notifying the Company Secretary in writing at the address of the Company given on page 222 of the Annual Report and Accounts by the close of business on Friday, 22 April 2016.
