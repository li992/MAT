Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2015 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees.
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland.
The consolidated financial statements and affected notes for the year ended 31 July 2014 have been restated to present the French businesses as discontinued operations under IFRS 5.
Accounting developments and changes A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out innote 37 i on pages 145 to 150.
The following standards have been published, but not yet applied: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Group will apply these standards when they become applicable, currently expected to be in the year ending 31 July 2019.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements oftheGroup.
No other issued standard or interpretation would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Choices permitted by IFRS The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its financial instruments.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Several of the Groups accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
The following areas are most sensitive to the accuracy of such estimates.
Impairment of assets The Group reviews assets that have an indefinite useful life at least annually to assess whether their recoverable amount exceeds their carrying value.
The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less disposal costs and value in use, which in turn is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset.
Where carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount a provision for the impairment is established with a charge included in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is assessed on the basis of the value in use estimate for the cash generating unit CGU or where appropriate aggregation of CGUs to which they are attributed.
The estimate of value in use, and hence the outcome of the impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made for revenue growth, long-term growth rate of their market and the discount rate considered appropriate to reflect the time value of money and any risks specific to the CGU that are not reflected in the cash flows.
Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all these assumptions and further details concerning the sensitivity of key judgements made by the Directors have been presented on pages 121 and 122.
There has been an impairment charge in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets of 238 million in the year ended 31 July 2015 2014: nil note 12.
Supplier rebates In line with industry practice, the Group has agreements Supplier Rebates with a number of its suppliers whereby volume-based rebates, marketing support and other discounts are received in connection with the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers.
Wolseley plc 108 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials Shareholder information 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued Supplier rebates continued Volume-based rebates Volume-based rebates are recognised based on purchase volumes in accordance with the supplier contract and are calculated by applying a contractually agreed percentage to the gross purchase price of the goods as specified in the suppliers invoice.
An amount due in respect of Supplier Rebates is not recognised within the income statement until all the relevant performance criteria, where applicable, have been met and the goods have been sold to a third party.
The majority of volume-based rebates are determined by reference to guaranteed rates of rebate.
These are calculated through a mechanical process with minimal judgement required to determine the amount recorded in the income statement.
A small proportion of volume-based rebates are subject to stepped targets where the rebate percentage increases as volumes purchased reach agreed targets within a set period of time.
The majority of rebate agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year and therefore judgement is required to estimate the rebate amount recorded in the income statement at the end of the period.
The Group assesses the probability that targeted volumes will be achieved in the year based on forecasts which are informed by historical trading patterns, current performance and trends.
This judgement is exercised consistently and prudently with historically insignificant true-ups at the end of the period.
Marketing support Marketing support, which represents a smaller element of the Groups overall Supplier Rebates, is recognised in the income statement when all performance conditions have been fulfilled.
Cost of sales Rebates relating to the purchase of goods for resale are accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a deduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold.
Supplier rebates receivable Judgement is also required over the recoverability of receivables relating to stepped target rebates.
This risk of misstatement of the estimate ismitigated by regular invoicing and timely collection of amounts receivable.
Where supplier rebates are netted off the amounts owing to that supplier, any outstanding amount at the balance sheet date is included within trade payables.
Where the Supplier Rebates are not offset against amounts owing to a supplier, the outstanding amount is included within prepayments and accrued income.
The carrying value of inventory is reduced by the relevant amount where the inventory has not been sold by the balance sheet date.
Valuation of inventories Inventory comprises finished goods.
Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable value is estimated to be less than the cost.
Inventories which are damaged or obsolete are written down as identified.
The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical experience.
The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision is based.
The Group held provisions in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2015 amounting to 103 million 2014: 113 million.
The gross value of inventory is reduced to reflect Supplier Rebates where the inventory has not been sold.
As at 31 July 2015, this deduction to gross inventory amounted to 181 million 2014: 166 million.
Provisions Provisions for self-insured risks, legal claims, environmental restoration and onerous leases are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Such provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for self-insured risks The Group retains layers of certain of its insurable risks, principally US casualty and global property damage, which are managed by a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited.
Certain of the retained risks are subject to an annual actuarial assessment.
The provision for self-insured risks represents an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported.
The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision isbased.
At 31 July 2015, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was 41 million 2014: 41 million.
Wolseley plc 109 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued Provisions continued Provisions for legal, environmental and related exposures and contingent liabilities The Group provides for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos-related litigation and product liability claims, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute or matter.
In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers.
The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement negotiations, and the actual cost of settlement may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based.
At 31 July 2015, legal, environmental and other provisions amounted to 133 million 2014: 151 million.
Where the Group has insurance cover that it is virtually certain will settle a provision, it recognises an equivalent asset in trade and other receivables.
The Group may also become involved in legal proceedings or commercial disputes in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings or disputes.
In these cases, where material, appropriate disclosure is included in the financial statements but no provision is made where the contingent liability cannot be quantified.
Provisions for onerous leases When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount of the assets in the case of finance leases and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract for all leases.
Determining the amount of such a provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.
Actual cash flows paid and received may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based.
At 31 July 2015, the provision for onerous leases was 29 million 2014: 42 million.
Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 25.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations.
The Groups liability or surplus recognised on the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high-quality corporate bonds that have a maturity approximating to the terms of the pension obligations.
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases and inflation.
Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
The net interest amount is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit net asset or liability at the beginning of the period.
The pension plan net interest is presented as finance income or expense.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate, inflation and life expectancy.

Segmental analysis The Groups reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products and building materials.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal.
The Groups customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer.
In the year ended 31 July 2014, Central Europe and France were reported in a single segment.
In 2015, following the reclassification of the French businesses into discontinued operations, this segment has been renamed Central Europe and all comparatives have been restated for consistency and comparability.
Revenue by reportable segment for continuing operations is as follows: 2015 2014 m m USA 8,343 7,070 UK 1,987 1,853 Nordic 1,864 1,935 Canada 733 779 Central Europe 405 634 Group 13,332 12,271 Wolseley plc 111 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.

Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
If provisions have been made for exceptional items in previous years, then any reversal of those provisions is shown as exceptional.
Exceptional items included in operating profit from continuing operations are analysed by purpose as follows: Restated 2015 2014 m m Gain on disposal of businesses 26 Loss on closure of businesses 5 11 Other exceptional items 1 16 Total included in operating profit 4 1 For the year ended 31 July 2015, a loss on disposal of a small industrial business in Canada offset a gain on a small industrial business in the USA.
Exceptional items in 2014 have been restated to exclude a credit of 19 million which is classified within discontinued operations.
The gain on disposal of businesses in 2014 principally relates to write-backs on consideration received in the form of loan notes for disposals in previous years.
Loss on closure of businesses includes the impairment of assets from branch closures in the Nordic region.
Other exceptional items represent integration costs for an acquisition in Finland.

Discontinued operations During the year, the Group sold its Wood Solutions business in France and incurred an exceptional loss on disposal of 59 million, including 4 million arising from the recycling of deferred foreign exchange translation losses.
The Group is in the process of selling its remaining business and property assets the disposal group in France and, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the disposal group has been classified as discontinued and prior periods have been restated to reflect this.
The Group is in negotiations to finalise the disposals.
The disposal group has been assessed against its recoverable amount and has been written down to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell.
The impairment resulting from this assessment is 67 million which has been categorised as an exceptional item as disclosed below.
The business disposal is expected to complete in 2015 16 and any gain or loss on disposal will depend on the change in net current assets arising from subsequent trading activities and the final consideration.
An exceptional gain of 16 million has been recognised within finance income.
This gain relates to the disposal of a convertible bond received from a disposal in the prior year.
The results from discontinued operations, which have been included in the Group income statement, are set out below.

Dividends continued Since the end of the financial year, the Directors have proposed a final ordinary dividend of 156 million 60.5 pence per share.
The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore, in accordance with accounting standards, has been excluded from these financial statements.
Non-GAAP performance measures Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
As explained on page 156, the Group considers that trading profit, and other performance measures based on it, including EBITDA before exceptional items, present valuable additional information to users of the financial statements.

CGUs have been aggregated in the disclosure above at a segmental level: however, impairment reviews were performed for each individual CGUduring the year ended 31 July 2015.
The relevant inputs to the value in use calculations of each CGU were: Cash flow forecasts for years one to three are derived from the most recent Board approved strategic plan: the forecast for year five represents an estimate of mid-cycle trading performance for the CGU based on historic analysis.
Year four is calculated as the average ofthe final year of the strategic plan and year fives mid-cycle estimate.
A risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of each country which ranges from 9.0 per cent to 15.2 per cent.
The equivalent post-tax discount rate ranges from 7.2 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
The 30-year long-term growth rate by country, as published by the IMF in April 2015 has been used for all CGUs except for the Nordic region where a lower long-term growth rate was applied consistent with the previous year.
The strategic plan is developed based on analyses of sales, markets and costs at a regional level.
Consideration is given to past events, knowledge of future contracts and the wider economy.
It takes into account both current business and future initiatives.

Intangible assets goodwill continued Nordic The impairment review for the Nordic segment has resulted in an impairment charge of 234 million.
In allocating the impairment charge we have considered the impairment of all assets as well as goodwill.
This has been allocated as follows: Remaining Acquired goodwill and Post-tax Goodwill intangibles Total Impairment intangibles discount rate CGU m m m m m % Stark, Denmark 49 55 104 104 7.9 Silvan, Denmark 21 21 21 7.9 Stark, Finland previously Starkki 57 24 81 81 7.7 Beijer, Sweden 92 22 114 28 86 7.8 Total 198 122 320 234 86 An impairment trigger arose for the Danish and Swedish businesses based on expectations at January 2015.
Whilst some improvement has occurred since then, there continues to be uncertainty over the economies and business performance going forward.
As a result, expectations of future profitability for these businesses were significantly reduced, resulting in the impairment charges for Stark Denmark, Silvan and Beijer as reflected in the table above.
Finnish markets deteriorated further during the year.
Given the challenging market conditions, expectations of reduced future profitability were reflected in the value in use calculation generating an impairment charge for Stark Finland of 81 million.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis on each key assumption like-for-like revenue growth, post-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate, keeping all other assumptions constant.
Two CGUs within the Nordic region still hold goodwill and acquired intangibles at the year-end: Neumann Norway and Beijer Sweden, both of which have limited headroom at 31 July 2015.
We have disclosed the sensitivity analysis below.
The results in the table show the amounts by which the related assumptions can vary such that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equal their recoverable amount.

Canada Market conditions for the Canadian Pipes, Valves and Fittings PVF CGU, which operates in the oil and gas sector, have been challenging and expectations of future profitability for this business have been reduced.
The value in use calculation generated an impairment charge of 4 million for the total PVF goodwill balance.

UK deferred tax is therefore recognised at the reduced rate of 20 per cent.
Deferred tax assets in the UK have been recognised on the basis that the UK is forecast to have sufficient taxable profits in the future toenable these to be utilised.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 77 million 2014: 46 million that have not been recognised onthe basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The losses are in the UK and France.
The UK losses relate to capital transactions and are not recognised on the basis that there are no transactions resulting in capital gains against which they can be offset.
The French losses relate to asset impairments.
These deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the basis that we are not expecting France to have sufficient taxable profits in the future toutilise them.
None of these losses has an expiry date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
However, tax may arise on 200 million 2014: 207 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and itis probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Financial instruments and financial risk management Capital structure To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure based on current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items.
The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio remains within 1 to 2 times.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity During the year ended 31 July 2015, the Group entered into a new 800 million revolving credit facility which matures in September 2020.
The Group also cancelled four existing revolving credit facilities totalling 1,201 million.
As at 31 July 2015, 120 million was drawn under the new 800 million facility and 384 million was fully drawn under the trade receivables facility.

The environmental and legal provision includes 49 million 2014: 49 million for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 2.2 per cent 2014: 2.6 per cent.
This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2015 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient cover for the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, theamount of performing insurance cover significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.
Other provisions include warranty costs relating to businesses disposed of and rental commitments on vacant properties and dilapidations onleased properties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.

Retirement benefit obligations continued iv Plan risks As described on page 157, the defined benefit plans typically expose the Company to the following actuarial risks which are managed for the UK plan by a Joint Working Group, comprising the Trustees of the defined benefit plan and employees of the Company.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the actual return on plan assets is below this rate, it will decrease a net surplus or increase a net pension liability.
Currently, theplan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and property.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the Trustees of the pension plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equity securities toleverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability, and this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.

The amendments incorporated technical amendments made automatically by the Finance Act 2013 and Finance Act 2014 including, but not limited to, individuals who cease to be employed by reason of retirement being treated as good leavers if they retire in accordance with the Companys retirement policy, and that the right to exercise an option is given in the event of a non-UK reorganisation.
Awards granted under the executive share option plans are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent.
The number of outstanding and exercisable share options and share awards are detailed below: 2015 2014 Number of shares options 000s 000s Outstanding at 1 August 5,680 8,048 Granted 1,268 1,437 Options exercised or shares vested 1,890 3,415 Surrendered or expired 635 390 Outstanding at 31 July 4,423 5,680 Exercisable at 31 July 942 1,490 In 2015 2014 Weighted average fair value per share option granted during the year 18.26 17.69 At 31 July 2015, 4,423,383 2014: 4,470,526 of the shares and options outstanding had an exercise price which was below the market price.
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all plans except the long-term incentive plan, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used.
Wolseley plc 137 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Share-based payments continued The fair value of shares granted under the ordinary share plan for more information please refer to page 149 was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Long-term Executive share options Employee share options incentive plans 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Risk free interest rate 1.6% 1.8% 0.8% 1.6% 1.0% 0.4% Expected dividend yield 3.3% 2.5% 2.5% 2.9% 0.0% 0.0% Expected volatility 32% 43% 22% 29% 23% 29% Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1-6 years 1-6 years 3 years 3 years Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historical volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due to the Groups capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.
The principal assumptions for the ordinary share plan are an expected dividend yield of approximately 3.3 per cent and an expected life of three years.

Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group has gained access, and additional profitability and operating efficiencies available in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed 103 million to revenue, 2 million to trading profit and 2 million to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before and after tax, as the Group manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been 13,449 million and Group trading profit would have been 860 million.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, asstated above.
It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would havebeen acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Some of these operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for.
At 31 July 2015, provisions include an amount of 29 million 2014: 42 million in respect of minimum lease payments for such onerous leases net of sublease payments expected to be received.
The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2015 is 7 million 2014: 14 million.
The commitments above include 20 million 2014: 31 million of operating lease commitments relating to discontinued operations.
Contingent liabilities Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, among other things, the suitability of products, contract and commercial disputes and disputes with employees.
Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise.
In the case of unfavourable outcomes, the Group may benefit from applicable insurance recoveries.
Certain claims arise as a result of the unintentional supply of defective products and these claims are usually the responsibility of the manufacturer, though defence and other costs may also be incurred by the Group.
Warranties and guarantees in relation to business disposals The Group has disposed of a number of non-core businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and guarantees to acquirers and other third parties, including warranties regarding financial statements and taxation.
Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability is likely to crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provision has been made could be received in the future.
Group companies have also guaranteed certain property and other obligations which could be called in an event of default.
As at the dateofthis report, there are no significant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals.
Environmental The operations of certain Group companies are subject tospecific environmental regulations.
From time to time, the Group conducts preliminary investigations through third parties to assess potential risks including potential soil or groundwater contamination of sites.
Where an obligation to remediate contamination arises then this is provided for, though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision is made.
Outcome The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are unclear, further time is needed to assess properly the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Post-balance sheet events The Group issued 512 million US$800 million of US Private Placement bonds on 1 September 2015.
A one-year extension of the trade receivables facility for 384 million US$600 million was approved on 11 September 2015.

The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations isshown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate from the other results of the Group.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using the average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end.
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets.
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve see the separate accounting policy on derivative financial instruments.
In the event that a subsidiary undertaking which has a non-sterling functional currency is disposed of, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary undertaking concerned.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency net borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets as detailed above.

Additional information continued i Group accounting policies continued Business combinations The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity.
The interests of non-controlling shareholders are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to noncontrolling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests showing a deficit balance.
Revenue Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services falling within the Groups ordinary activities, excluding intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the customer.
The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or picked up by the customer.
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the customer has been completed.
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted.
A portion of the fair value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits and recognised in the period that loyalty credits are redeemed.
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and overheads attributable to assembly and construction services.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included within intangible assets.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or aggregations of cash generating units together CGUs where synergy benefits are expected.
CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
For goodwill impairment testing purposes, no CGU is larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses onthe disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to each CGU.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

Additional information continued i Group accounting policies continued Other intangible assets An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable thatthe expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably.
The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other intangible assets.
The cost ofthe intangible assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 4 25 years Trade names and brands 1 15 years Other 1 4 years Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training and data conversion are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the income statement over its estimated useful life as follows: Software 3 5 years Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated.
Property, plant and equipment PPE PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the course of construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
In addition, subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 20 50 years Operating leasehold improvements over the period of the lease Plant and machinery 7 10 years Computer hardware 3 5 years Fixtures and fittings 5 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives.
The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current amounts.
The interest elements of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
The cost of operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.
Wolseley plc 147 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Additional information continued i Group accounting policies continued Assets and disposal groups held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business.
Where agroup of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also classified as held for sale.
For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected toresult in a completed sale within 12 months.
Assets that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated.
Assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.
Inventories Inventories, which comprise all goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the transactions in those items of inventory.
The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Examples of such evidence include significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed as being remote.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off arecredited to the income statement.
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2015 in respect of impaired receivables represented 0.14per cent of revenue 2014 restated: 0.13 per cent.
The Group held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2015 amounting to35 million 2014: 39 million.
Retirement benefit obligations Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the cost of providing benefits is determined annually using the projected unit credit method by independent qualified actuaries.
The current service cost of defined benefit plans is recorded within operating profit.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The asset liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.

Additional information continued i Group accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax represents the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities andtheir carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised tothe extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital Treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups executive share option, long-term incentive, employee share purchase and ordinary share plans.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these plans that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies.
For equity-settled plans, the fair value is determined at the date of grant including the impact of any non-vesting conditions such as a requirement for employees to save and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled plans, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders of the Company or paid.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no legal right of offset and or no practice of net settlement with cash balances.
Cash, which is not freely available to the Group, is disclosed as restricted cash.
Wolseley plc 149 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Additional information continued i Group accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from thebusiness activities of the Group and the financing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are recognised in the income statement.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in theincome statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Additional information continued ii Additional information about financial instruments continued The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.
The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The Groups other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value.
Other receivables include an amount of 48 million 2014: 48 million which has been discounted at a rate of 2.2 per cent 2014: 2.6 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.
Because other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values.

Financial instruments: risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well-defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2015 and 31 July 2014.
By the nature of its business, the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses.
There has been no change during or since the previous year-end in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period underreview, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Wolseley plc 153 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Additional information continued ii Additional information about financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows excluding interest income and income from derivatives including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows: Trade and other Interest payables Debt on debt Total As at 31 July 2015 m m m m Due in less than one year 1,896 141 31 2,068 Due in one to two years 15 3 37 55 Due in two to three years 11 103 34 148 Due in three to four years 7 2 31 40 Due in four to five years 9 1 31 41 Due in over five years 83 814 113 1,010 Total 2,021 1,064 277 3,362 Trade and other Interest payables Debt on debt Total As at 31 July 2014 m m m m Due in less than one year 1,888 156 28 2,072 Due in one to two years 20 390 21 431 Due in two to three years 9 6 17 32 Due in three to four years 7 98 15 120 Due in four to five years 6 3 12 21 Due in over five years 69 303 28 400 Total 1,999 956 121 3,076 Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 63 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars and 5 per cent in euros.
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures.
However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts orcurrency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated to materially match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the five-year summary on page 168.
The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by 101 million 0.8 per cent 2014: decrease by 459 million, or 3.8 per cent and to increase trading profit by 19 million 2.5 per cent 2014: decrease by 31 million or 4.3 per cent.
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, euro and Canadian dollars as follows: Wolseley plc 154 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials Shareholder information 37.

The principal value of those financial instruments designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was 1,000 million 2014: 1,260 million.
The loss on translation of these financial instruments into sterling of 46 million 2014: gain of 77 million has been taken to the translation reserve.
At 31 July 2015, the Group had the following short-term currency swaps and forward contracts which were designated and effective as hedges of overseas operations.

This percentage is regularly reviewed by the Board.
At 31 July 2015, 52per cent of loans were at fixed rates.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
Rates which reset at least every 12 months are regarded as floating rates and the Group then, if appropriate, considers interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings.

Credit risk Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able topay outstanding balances.
At 31 July 2015, the maximum exposure to credit risk was 1,890 million 2014: 1,919 million.
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In some cases, protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based.
Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management considers that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of 368 million 2014: 282 million.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties.
The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group has estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which it is exposed would result in a charge to the income statement of 5 million 2014: 3 million, arising from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
The Group has estimated that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent against borrowings denominated in foreign currency in which the Group does business, would result in a charge to equity of 157 million 2014: 74 million, and a credit of 3 million 2014: 4 million to the income statement, arising from the retranslation of interest rate swaps held at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Groups exposure to any of the macroeconomic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.
Additional information about non-GAAP measures and performance Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance indicators, calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

Additional information continued iv Additional information about pensions and other long-term employee benefits Description of plans The principal UK defined benefit plan is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
This plan was closed to new entrants in 2009.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
The Group Retirement Benefits Plan was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2013 and was replaced by a new defined contribution plan.
Obligations under the UK defined contribution plan are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution plans, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
The Group also operates two defined benefit plans in the United States which are closed to new entrants.
One of the plans is funded and the majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
In Canada, defined benefit plans and a defined contribution plan are operated.
Most of the Canadian defined benefit plans are funded.
In Europe, both defined contribution and defined benefit plans are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit plans are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Investment policy The Groups investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK plan, the strategy is to invest approximately 70 per cent of the assets in growth assets comprising 50 per cent in equities and 20per cent in other diversified growth assets and 30 per cent in bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the plan trustees in consultation with the Company.
For the overseas plans the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.
