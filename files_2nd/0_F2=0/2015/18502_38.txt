Fidessa group plc 63 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The primary influences on Fidessas effective tax rate are changes in headline tax rates and tax disallowances or incentives in the countries operated in.
This is reflected by the correlation between Fidessas effective tax rate and the UK headline tax rate over the last five years.
From 2010 through 2015 Fidessas effective tax rate has reduced from 30.1% to 24.5% and in the same time the UK headline tax rate has fallen from 28.0% to 20.3%.
These are expected to continue to be the primary influences on the effective tax rate into the future.
