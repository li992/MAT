SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Guernsey Law 2008 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and therefore the Companys financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards IAS Regulation.
The Company has not adopted during the year any new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards interpretations and amendments.
New and revised accounting standards have been published and will be mandatory for the Companys accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or later periods, however the impact of these standards is not expected to be material to the reported results and financial position of the Company.
b Basis of preparation The Company a Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investor s with investment management services: b Commits to its investor s that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and c Measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Consequently, the Company does not consolidate its subsidiaries or apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations when it obtains control of another entity as it is considered to be an Investment Entity under IFRS.
Instead, the Company measures its investment in its subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss.
The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company only.
The Company recognises its investment in its direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value estimate of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes the fair value of both this company and all of the Companys subsidiaries and PPP investments.
The Company invests solely for capital appreciation, investment income, or both.
Consequently, the Company does not plan to hold its investments indefinitely.
The Company has an exit strategy for the portfolio of investments held indirectly.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. is itself an investment entity.
Consequently, the Company need not have an exit strategy for its investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. Similarly, any other subsidiaries that are investment entities themselves do not require an exit strategy to meet the denition of an investment entity.
Each investment indirectly held subordinated debt together with equity has a nite life.
The subordinated debt will mature towards the end of the concession and at the end of the concession the investment will be liquidated.
The exit strategy is that investments will normally be held to liquidation at the end of the concession unless the Company sees an opportunity in market to dispose of investments.
John Laing Capital Management Limited the Investment Adviser and the JLIF Board regularly consider whether any disposals should be made.
Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2015 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Going concern The Directors, in their consideration of going concern have reviewed comprehensive cash ow forecasts prepared by the Investment Adviser, which are based on prudent market data and past experience and believe, based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Companys and the Groups committed banking facilities, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Company on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 33.8 million including 2.5 million for the Company and a new five-year banking facility available for investment in new or existing projects and working capital of 180 million, which expires in August 2020.
As at 31 December 2015, there was 17 million drawn under the facility which was repaid in January 2016.
The Group subsequently borrowed 89.5 million to finance the acquisitions detailed in note 20 of these financial statements.
In addition, all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
In March 2016, the Company successfully raised gross proceeds of 92.9 million through the placing of additional new ordinary shares.
These proceeds will be used to repay the outstanding debt of 89.5 million.
The Company, through its intermediate holding companies, holds investments in 57 operational PPP project companies which yield annual interest, dividends and loan repayments.
The cash ow yields from the projects cover the Groups expected cash ow requirements for overheads and targeted dividend distribution policy.
The Company and its intermediate holding companies have sufficient financial resources together with their PPP investments public sector long-term contracts across a range of infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors consider that the Company and its intermediate holdings companies are well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Certain risks and uncertainties, as detailed in note 18 have been considered by the Board.
The Board has concluded that these do not represent a significant threat to the Company and the Group as the Groups income is generated from a portfolio of PPP concessions which are supported by government-backed cash ows and are forecast to cover the Groups committed costs.
The Directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these annual financial statements.
d Revenue recognition Operating income Operating income in the income statement represents the combination of the income from and the movement in the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. Refer to note 10 for details.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED g Taxation Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.
The underlying project companies in which the Group invests provide for and pay taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate.
h Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement.
i Financial assets The Company classies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The classication depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
The Company determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
In these financial statements, investment at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value of the Companys direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which comprises the fair value of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. all the intermediate holding companies and the PPP Investments.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies net assets are mainly composed of cash and working capital and an outstanding loan balance of 17 million and are recognised at fair value which is equivalent to their net assets.
The Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. comprises both equity and a profit participating agreement PPA.
Both elements are exposed to the same primary risk, being performance risk.
This performance risk is taken into consideration when determining the discount rate applied to the forecast cash ows.
In determining fair value the Board considered observable market transactions and have measured fair value using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset including assumptions regarding risk.
The profit participating agreement and equity are considered to have the same risk characteristics.
As such the profit participating agreement and equity form a single class of financial instrument for the purposes of disclosure.
The Company measures its investment as a single class of financial asset at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
b Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classied as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
They are included in current assets, except where maturities are in greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classied as Non-Current Assets.
The Companys loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED h Financial instruments continued ii Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classied as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
a Equity instruments share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classied as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the balance of the Share Premium Account.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classied as other financial liabilities, comprising of: Loans and borrowings which are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loan and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis: and Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
iii Effective interest method The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant assets carrying amount.
iv Fair value estimation The Companys investments at fair value are not traded in active markets.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
In these financial statements, investment at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value of the Companys direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which comprises the fair value of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. all the intermediate holding companies and the PPP investments.
Fair value of the PPP investments is calculated by discounting at an appropriate discount rate future cash ows expected to be received by the Groups intermediate holdings, from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments.
The discount rates are relevant and in the range of those applied in the market for similar PPP investments.
The basis of discount rates are long run average government bond rates adjusted for an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk.
Risk premia are then added to this adjusted base gilt rate depending on the phase of the project and any specic risks to which the project is exposed.
The discount rates that have been applied to the PPP investments at 31 December 2015 were in the range 7.19% to 8.46% 31 December 2014: 7.40% to 8.54%.
Refer to note 10 for details of the areas of estimation in the calculation of the fair value.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies net assets are mainly composed of cash and working capital and loan balances and are recognised at fair value which is equivalent to their net assets.
i Segmental reporting In the financial statements, the Company recognises one investment in its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. The Directors consider and analyse the performance of the Company by considering the Groups main activity which is to invest into PPP investments through its intermediate holding companies.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In the application of the Companys accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities that affect reported amounts.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss Fair value of intermediate holding companies The Directors consider that the carrying value of the financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair value.
Fair value of PPP investments Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash ows at the appropriate rate.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to risk-free rates, specic risks and the evidence of recent transactions.
Underlying assumptions and discount rates are disclosed in note 10.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.

The capital structure of the Company consists of equity comprising issued capital, share premium account, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in notes 14 to 16.
The capital structure of the Group, which comprises the Company, its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies, principally consists of a revolving credit facility for which the Company is a guarantor, cash and cash equivalents and equity comprising issued capital, share premium account, reserves and retained earnings.

As at the balance sheet date, the Company had no outstanding debt, however, as set out in note 2 c, the Companys indirect subsidiary, JLIF Limited Partnership benets from a Revolving Credit Facility of 180 million of which the Company is a guarantor.
As at 31 December 2015, 17 million was drawn under the facility 31 December 2014: nil.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and ination risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and capital risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group and its investment entities use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the Company and the intermediate holding companies subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by the investment adviser who operates within the Board approved policies.
In relation to the Groups investment in project companies, due to the nature of the investments, certain financial risks typically interest rate and ination risks are hedged at the inception of a project.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Financial risk management Company only The Company accounts for its investments in its subsidiaries at fair value.
To the extent there are changes as a result of the risks set out below, these impact the fair value of the Companys investments.
Capital risk The Company has implemented an efficient nancing structure that enables it to manage its capital effectively.
The Companys capital structure comprises its equity only refer to the Statement of Changes in Equity.
As at 31 December 2015 the Company had no debt 2014: nil.
Liquidity risk The Directors monitor the Companys liquidity requirements to ensure there is sufficient cash to meet the Companys operating needs.
The Company adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its obligations.
Due to the nature of its investments the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Company.
The Companys liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows and forecasting the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
The Company was in a net cash position and had no outstanding debt at the balance sheet date 2014: nil.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company accounts for its investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. at fair value in Sterling.
The Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l and its subsidiaries have a small portion of their expenses and net assets denominated in Euro.
The Company considers that the currency exposure is minimal and as such does not require currency hedging.
Financial risk management Company and subsidiaries The following risks impact the Companys subsidiaries and in turn may impact the fair value of investments held by the Company.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by ensuring it maintains adequate cash and available banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of the financial assets and liabilities.
Due to the nature of its investments PPP projects the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Group.
The Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows in major currencies and assuming the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Company, its intermediate holding companies or its PPP project companies will default on the contractual obligations they entered into.
Credit risk is subsumed within the overall Companys performance risk.
The Company, its 100% owned direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies rely on the performance of their main counterparties where credit risk arises, mainly from the Groups investments in PPP projects.
The performance risk arises from the PPP investments inability to pay the forecast distributions as the Group relies on its PPP investments projects companies to perform adequately and return the expected yields.
Several factors could hinder this ability such as poor operational performance, exceptional expenditures, major maintenance overspend or an event that would affect the PPP project companys cover ratios.
The Groups PPP investments are also dependent on the performance of their main operational contractors.
The Group regularly monitors the contractors concentration and financial strength.
The Directors and Investment Adviser regularly assess the returns forecast from PPP investments through the update of cash ow forecasts and by monitoring the operational and financial performance of these investments with regular performance meetings.
The Groups PPP investments project companies receive regular, long-term, index-linked revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients or directly from the public via real tolls, providing a stable and low-risk income stream.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group mitigates its risk on cash investments and derivative transactions by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies a minimum of Standard and Poors A-1.
The Directors believe that the Group is not signicantly exposed to credit risk and that its investments underlying risks are monitored and sufciently mitigated for the investments to deliver the expected return to the Group.
The Directors have considered the above factors and the discount rate sensitivities disclosed in note 10 and does not consider it appropriate to present a detailed analysis of credit risk.
Market risk ination risk Each of the Groups PPP asset investments will typically have part of its revenue and costs linked to a specic ination index at inception of the project.
In most cases this creates a natural hedge, meaning a derivative does not need to be entered into in order to mitigate ination risk.
However, in a minority of cases where the investment has index-linked cash ows that fall outside of this natural hedge, the ination risk is hedged using RPI ination swaps.
For a sensitivity analysis of investments at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 10.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company has one investment in its direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through holding Euro cash balances and contracting with service providers paid in Euro.
The level of these balances and expenditures are marginal and do not pose a significant risk to the value recognised in the Companys balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2015, the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes six 2014: six overseas investments.
The Company and its subsidiaries foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to hedge automatically on an individual project basis but to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
At 31 December 2015, the Companys investment at fair value through profit or loss does not includes any foreign exchange forward contract 31 December 2014: four foreign exchange forward contracts included, with a non material fair value.
The Company and its subsidiaries are mainly exposed to uctuations in the Euro and Canadian dollar exchange rates.
The amount of the Companys investments fair value foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at the reporting date was as follows: Fair Value 2015 2014 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 73,219 82,824 Euro 35,254 38,966 108,473 121,790 The following table details the Companys sensitivity to a 5% increase or decrease in Sterling against relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary items fair valued within the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and reects a 5% change in foreign currency exchange rates.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit from operations where the relevant currency weakens by 5% against Sterling.
For a 5% strengthening of the relevant currency against Sterling, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit from operations, and the negative balances below would be positive.
31 December 2015 profit Investments before tax at fair value Effect on operating profit and investments at fair value of relevant currency weakening by 5% against Sterling: 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 3,708 3,708 Euro 1,926 1,926 5,634 5,634 31 December 2014 profit Investments before tax at fair value Effect on operating profit and investments at fair value of relevant currency weakening by 5% against Sterling: 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 4,143 4,143 Euro 1,948 1,948 6,091 6,091 Market risk interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises on the credit facility borrowings and oating rate deposits.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to variability of interest payment cash ows.
Each PPP investment hedges its interest rate risk at the inception of a project.
This will either be done by issuing a xed rate bond or, if the project is bank nanced, with xed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into xed rate by the use of interest rate swaps.
The uctuations in interest rates impact the return from oating rate deposits and hence the income from investments at fair value through profit or loss.
A 1% increase or decrease represents the Directors assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.
The Group was in a net cash position and had a small outstanding debt at the Balance Sheet date 31 December 2014: net cash position and no outstanding debt.
The interest rate sensitivity of the Groups assets and liabilities does not have a material impact.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The Company held the following financial instruments at fair value at 31 December 2015.
There have been no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.

There were no Level 2 assets or liabilities during the year 2014: none.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2, Level 1 and 3 or Level 2 and 3 during the year 2014: none.
In the table above, financial instruments are held at carrying value as an approximation to fair value unless stated otherwise.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening to closing balances of the investments at fair value through profit or loss is given in note 10.
The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of Level 3 inputs, include the fair value of the Companys 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. the intermediate holding companies and the Groups PPP investments.
The fair value of the Companys direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies mainly comprises cash and working capital and an outstanding loan balance of 17 million.
The fair values of these companies are equivalent to their Net Assets.
The Groups PPP investments are valued by discounting future cash ows from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of each discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital, is the long run average government bond rates adjusted by an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk, phase of the PPP project and counterparty credit risk.
The weighted average discount rate applied was 7.82% year ended 31 December 2014: 7.94%.
The discount rate is considered the most significant unobservable input through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss.
An absolute increase of 1% in the discount rate would cause a decrease in fair value of the PPP investments of 65.1 million year ended 31 December 2014: 65.6 million.
For a sensitivity analysis of Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 10.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.
Foreign currency and interest rate prole of financial liabilities The Companys financial liabilities at 31 December 2015 were 2.7million 2014: 2.7 million.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS In December 2015, the Group committed to the purchase of 40% interest in the Barcelona Line 9 Section II Metro Stations project from Iridium Concesiones fide Infraestructuras, a subsidiary of Grupo ACS, for approximately 85 million.
The Company has provided a guarantee under the JLIF Limited Partnerships 180 million multicurrency revolving credit facility which expires in August 2020.
As at 31 December 2015, 17 million was drawn on the facility.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, this was repaid in full.
The fair value of the guarantee is considered to be immaterial to the Company accounts as the probability of the guarantee being called upon is considered to be extremely unlikely.
In making this assessment, consideration has been given to the proximity of the current and forecast metrics to default covenants attached to the facility and the dependability of future cash ows from the underlying PPP investments.
As at 31 December 2015, the Company and the intermediate holding companies had no other commitments.

DISCLOSURE SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group holds investments in 57 service concession arrangements in the Health, Education, Justice and Emergency Services, Government Buildings, Regeneration and Social Housing, Transport and Street Lighting sectors.
The concessions vary on the obligations required, but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the asset may include the provision of facilities management services such as cleaning, catering, caretaking, and major maintenance.
As at 31 December 2015, for all but two 2014: all but two of the Companys investments, the residual interest will be transferred to the relevant government public authorities at the end of each concession term.
There are two 2014: two concessions for which the head lease will be retained by the concession provider at the end of the concession period.
The value of these head leases is not considered to be material.
As at 31 December 2015 all of the service concessions were fully operational 31 December 2014: all.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specic project agreement.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
