As the funding was considered to be permanent, no foreign exchange volatility was recognised within financing fair value remeasurements in the Group income statement.
In November 2014, the funding was partially repaid.
The Group exchanged the repayment into US dollars and used it to repay debt.
Accordingly, the remaining funding was no longer regarded as permanent for the purposes of EU-IFRS and as a result of the 25.2% weakening in the Brazilian real against the US dollar between then and 31 March 2015, a charge of US$86m has been recognised within financing fair value remeasurements in the current year note 15 c. The Group is similarly exposed to the impact of the Brazilian real strengthening or weakening against the US dollar in the future.
A movement of 28% would result in a US$94m impact on profit before tax.
There is no effect on total equity as a result of this exposure, since it arises on intra-Group funding and there would be a related equal and opposite foreign exchange movement recognised in the translation reserve within equity.
On the basis of the profile of foreign exchange exposures, and an assessment of reasonably possible changes in such exposures, there are no other material sensitivities to foreign exchange risk at the balance sheet dates.
In making these assessments, actual data on movements in the principal currencies over the most recent three-year period has been considered together with exposures at the balance sheet dates.
This methodology has been applied consistently.
