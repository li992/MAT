Segmental analysis Operating segments reflect the management structure of the group and the way performance is evaluated and resources allocated based on group NPR and EBITA by the groups chief operating decision maker, defined as the executive directors.
Following management changes effective 1 July 2014 the groups Africa and South Africa: Beverages divisions have been consolidated into one division for management purposes.
The results of the new combined Africa division have therefore been presented as a single reportable segment and comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The group is focused geographically and, while not meeting the definition of reportable segments, the group reports separately as segments Corporate and South Africa: Hotels and Gaming as this provides useful additional information.
The segmental information presented below includes the reconciliation of GAAP measures presented on the face of the income statement to non-GAAP measures which are used by management to analyse the groups performance.
