The tax rate was reduced from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 and a further reduction to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and then to 18% effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
The effective tax charge borne by the Company and its UK subsidiaries will reduce accordingly in future years.
All UK deferred tax assets and liabilities that will unwind in the future have been recognised at an average rate of 20%, which has been calculated based on the future rates which will apply at the estimated dates of unwinding.
com 111 Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Tax expense continued Factors affecting future tax charge The Groups overseas profits are subject to the tax rates which apply in relevant jurisdictions, some of which are lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
Non-UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2015 have also been calculated based on the rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.

112 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Benefits Trust.
Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude amortisation of intangible assets and acquisition-related items.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of these non-cash or one-off items.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators that the carrying value may be impaired.
Definite life intangibles are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
If any indication exists, further assessment is made of whether the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment testing is an area involving management judgement requiring assessment as to whether i there is an impairment indicator and, if so, ii the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.
There are a number of assumptions to determine the estimated recoverable amount.
For goodwill, we assess the recoverable amount by considering the Group's market capitalisation, external valuations prepared by analysts and our internal models.
We use internal models for other intangibles.
Assumptions include the selection of market growth rates, discount rates, assets under management flow assumptions, expected revenue growth and operating costs.
Further detail on these assumptions is shown on page 116. aberdeen-asset.
com 115 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use five year cash flow projections based on the Groups approved budget for the year to 30 September 2016.
The 2016 budget reflects the impact of outflows from this year, as well as any mitigating actions.
It is prepared on a bottom up basis and the growth rates below are average rates applied to the forecasts in later years.
A long term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows within the value-in-use calculations beyond the initial five year projections.
The long term growth rate assumption of 2% is in line with the long term nature of the Groups business and in line with the Boards view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long term.
The other principal assumptions in the forecasts for the periods beyond these covered by the budget: 2015 2014 % % Average annual increase in assets under management 3.8 5.0 Average annual increase in operating costs 3.0 4.0 The assumed annual increases in operating costs include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increased levels of business.
The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate to estimate a market rate relevant to the sector and associated risks.
2015 2015 2014 2014 Post tax Pre tax Post tax Pre tax % % % % Discount rate 11.22 12.91 9.94 11.53 The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The assumptions are derived from past experience and consideration of current market inputs.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis and without the effect of that change on other variables, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the value-in-use to the carrying value of goodwill were as follows: 2015 2014 % % Discount rate pre tax 19.7 26.5 Revenue growth rate 2.7 5.9 Operating cost growth rate 12.6 25.5 The value-in-use, calculated in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying values of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment.
The comparison resulted in a surplus of value-in-use of 1,414 million 2014: 4,307 million over the carrying value of these assets and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.
116 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Management contracts and distribution agreements The Group reviewed the management contracts and distribution agreements held at 30 September 2015 including 79.3 million 2014: 79.3 million of management contracts which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These indefinite life assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The Group also reviewed definite life assets for impairment indicators and performed impairment tests where required.
Impairment tests were performed using either value-in-use calculations using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill or estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as considered appropriate, and the measures of value compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
The categories of management contracts and distribution agreements, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2015 30 September 2014 Net book Remaining Estimated Net book Remaining Estimated values amortisation useful life values amortisation useful life m period years years m period years years Definite life management contracts 455.8 1-7 5-9 537.1 1-8 4-10 Definite life distribution contracts 3.0 1 5 Indefinite life open end fund contracts 79.3 N A Indefinite 79.3 N A Indefinite 535.1 619.4 The definite life management contracts include those acquired in the previous year as part of the SWIP acquisition, which have a net book value of 291.4 million at 30 September 2015 2014: 355.2 million, together with the contracts acquired from Credit Suisse in 2009 which have a net book value of 80.6 million 2014: 100.1 million.
Intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives.
This shall not exceed the period of the contractual rights but may be shorter depending on the period over which the entity expects to use the asset.
There is a judgement in assessing these lives including assessment of client retention.
We have typically assessed these to be between 5 and 10 years - looking at each acquisition on a case by case basis.
Factors considered include size of book of business, market and growth prospects and nature of investments managed under the contracts.
Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as the Group review described above.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
At 30 September 2015, the Company held indefinite life open end fund contracts with a value of 3.4 million 2014: 3.4 million.
com 117 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Acquisitions Acquisitions 2015 a.
On 31 August 2015, the Group completed the purchase of FLAG Capital Management, LLC FLAG, a manager of private equity and real asset solutions with offices in Stamford USA, Boston USA, and Hong Kong.
Total consideration for the transaction was 62.6 million $96.2 million comprising cash consideration of 52.0 million $80 million and contingent deferred consideration of 10.6 million under an earn-out agreement.
The fair value of the earn-out at completion was 10.6 million, determined by the probability weighted expected return and growth over the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017, subject to a maximum of 29.3 million $45 million, and discounted to a present value.
The undiscounted fair values identified in this analysis range from 1.3 million to 29.3 million.
After the impact of foreign exchange and unwinding the discount, totalling 0.3 million, the deferred liability is 10.9 million at 30 September 2015.
This acquisition is in line with the Groups strategy to strengthen and grow its global alternatives platform and solutions capabilities and FLAGs well-established private equity teams in the U. S. and Asia help broaden the Groups existing solutions business.
The acquired business added approximately 39.5 million of intangible assets and goodwill of 22.4 million arose on completion of an independent valuation see below.
In the one month to September 2015, FLAG added revenue of 1.6 million and profit before tax of 0.6 million.
However, if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2014, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have been increased by a further 21.5 million, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would have been increased by 4.9 million.
In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2014.
Acquisition-related costs of 2.3 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition costs see note 4. b.
Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets acquired in this transaction.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the table on the following page.
Goodwill is mainly attributable to the skills of the workforce acquired and the synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition.
The valuation of intangibles and the determination of useful economic lives determined at the point of acquisitions are significant accounting estimates.
Intangible assets are valued based on forecast income streams from the management contracts.
This includes assumptions on client attrition and markets.
Valuation of the earn-out agreements and recognition over the term are also significant accounting estimates.
This is discussed further in note 29.
The determination of useful economic lives is discussed in note 13.
118 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements c. The fair value of the intangible assets has been based on the present value of expected cash flows of the underlying management contracts.

On 30 June 2015, the Group completed its purchase of the remaining 49.9% stake in the UK joint venture, Aberdeen Private Equity Managers Limited SVGM, from SVG Capital plc SVGC for cash consideration of 29 million.
The Group originally acquired a 50.1% stake in May 2013 with the option of acquiring the remaining 49.9% stake for which a deferred liability of 35 million was recognised at acquisition, discounted to 27.5 million.
SVGM generated revenues of 17.9 million 2014: 28.8 million and profit after tax of 6.6 million 2014: 10.7 million, of which 3.3 million 2014: 5.4 million was allocated to non-controlling interest prior to acquisition of the remaining stake.
At acquisition, the Group recognised a decrease in non-controlling interest of 36.5 million, a decrease in retained earnings of 8.9 million and a reduction of 27.5 million in the put option reserve.

The Group completed the purchase from Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership Group Limited SWIP and its related private equity businesses on 31 March 2014 and the purchase of SWIPs infrastructure fund management business was completed on 1 May 2014.
Total consideration for the transaction was 606.6 million, comprising three elements: i 131.8 million new ordinary Aberdeen shares issued at an average price of 392.7p: ii a deferred top-up payment of 38.3 million payable on 31 March 2015: and iii contingent deferred consideration of up to 100 million under an earn-out agreement with Lloyds.
The fair value attributed to the earn-out payment at completion was 50.7 million.
108.5 million new shares were issued on 31 March 2014 at a share price of 390.3p and a further 5.95 million shares were issued on 1 May 2014 at a price of 443.4p.
The remaining 17.3 million shares were issued on 3 December 2014, Lloyds having received its necessary regulatory consents.
This element of consideration has been recognised in equity as a deferred share issue 67.6 million.
Total equity consideration recognised was 517.6 million.
The deferred top-up payment of 38.3 million was determined as the difference between the weighted average share price for the 5 days before the acquisition date and a floor price of 420p, the difference multiplied by the number of consideration shares.
The Group is entitled, at its sole option, to settle this item in cash or by the issue of further shares and, accordingly this payment was recognised as a current liability.
The Group settled in cash the deferred top-up payment of 38.3 million in cash on 31 March 2015.
The contingent deferred consideration of up to 100 million is payable in cash and the actual amount payable will be determined according to the growth over the five year period to 31 March 2019 of recurring revenue generated from the strategic relationship with Lloyds.
The fair value at completion of 50.7 million was determined based on a probability weighted expected return analysis of cash flow assumptions and calculated by reference to the expected performance and growth over 5 years, discounted to a present value.
The undiscounted fair values identified in this analysis range from 39.1 million to 100 million.
The fair value of the earn-out has been subsequently measured: after unwinding the year to date discount of 6.5 million 2014: 3.2 million and a reduction in fair value of 24.4 million see note 29, the deferred liability is 35.9 million 2014: 53.9 million at 30 September 2015.
The first annual instalment is due on 31 March 2016.
The acquisition of the SWIP businesses adds scale to the business across a range of asset classes, strengthens investment capabilities and adds new distribution channels in addition to the strategic relationship with Lloyds.
The acquired business added approximately 60 million of net tangible assets to the combined business, intangible assets of 394.5 million and goodwill of 227.6 million arose on completion of an independent valuation see below.
In the six month period to 30 September 2014, SWIP contributed revenue of 119.8 million and profit before tax of 59.8 million.
However, if the acquisitions had occurred on 1 October 2013, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have been increased by a further 120.0 million, and consolidated profit before taxation for the period would have been increased by a further 60.0 million.
In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2013.
Acquisition and integration related costs of 37.7 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition costs.
Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets acquired in both transactions.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
120 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements The fair value of the intangible assets has been based on the present value of expected cash flows of the underlying management contracts, with the exception of 7 million internally developed software which is based on managements best estimate of replacement cost.

There were no differences between any of the carrying amounts and their respective fair values.

Where investments are not listed, fair value is determined in accordance with independent professional valuers or International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines where relevant.
The fair value of unlisted investments in infrastructure funds is based on the phase of individual projects forming the overall investment and discounted cash flow techniques based on project earnings.
134 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into short term forward foreign exchange and equity futures contracts to hedge its exposure to associated risks in relation to certain seed capital investments.
Open forward foreign exchange contracts are valued using forward rates of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date for the remaining period until maturity, and are settled on a gross basis.
Open futures contracts are valued at the exchange quoted price at close of business on the balance sheet date.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are typically settled in a short time frame and are carried at the amount due to be settled.
As a result, the fair value of these balances is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value, after taking into account potential impairment losses.
Fair value of the written put option The Group purchased the remaining 49.9% stake in SVGM during the year from SVGC.
Further details of the acquisition and treatment of the written put option are provided in note 14.
Fair value of deferred consideration As described in note 14, there is a performance related earn-out payment of up to 29.3 million $45 million in connection with the FLAG acquisition dependent on the growth of the business in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017.
This can be settled in cash or by issue of ordinary shares at the discretion of the Group.
The fair value is determined based on a probability weighted expected return analysis of expected revenues over the period of the earn-out, discounted to present value.
The fair value of the deferred liability is 10.9 million at 30 September 2015.
As part of the consideration for the SWIP acquisition see note 14, there is a performance related earn-out payment of up to 100 million in cash dependent on the growth delivered by the investment solutions business acquired from Lloyds over the 5 years following completion of the acquisition.
The fair value of the earn-out agreement is determined on a probability weighted expected return analysis of expected cash flows under a number of scenarios, including both internal and external forecasts of the performance of the investment solutions business over the 5 year term, discounted to present value.
The valuation of deferred consideration involves significant accounting judgement around assessing the fair value of that liability.
Deferred consideration is valued based on forecast revenues appropriate to each earn-out agreement.
This includes assumptions based on revenue growth to date, market performance, the probability of returns and the appropriate discount rate.
Changes in fair value and the unwind of the discount are recognised in the income statement.
The fair value is reviewed at each reporting period against the performance of the underlying assets under management and associated revenue.
The fair value of the deferred consideration payable to Lloyds at 30 September 2015 is 35.9 million 2014: 53.9 million.
Growth in flows into Lloyds wealth portfolios managed by Aberdeens investment solutions business has been lower than originally anticipated and therefore the fair value has been reduced by 24.4 million to 35.9 million at 30 September 2015.
However, the actual amount payable will be determined by the performance and growth over the 5 year period to 31 March 2019.
On 31 March 2015, the Group settled in cash the deferred top up payment of 38.3 million with Lloyds in relation to the SWIP acquisition.
Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Groups life and pensions subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which allow clients to benefit from investing in pooled funds.
As explained in note 19, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to these assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
The Company bears no insurance risk.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.
Accordingly, these assets are not included in fair value measurements disclosure on page 136. aberdeen-asset.
com 135 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Fair value of financial instruments continued Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: Level 1 measurements are derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 investments during the year.
Investments classified as level 3 principally comprise investments in property and infrastructure funds.
While the Group is not aware of significant differences between valuations received and reasonable possible alternatives for the property funds, the value of these investments would be directly impacted by changes in the European and Asian property markets.
The fair value of the infrastructure funds would be impacted by a number of factors described above.
The Group estimates that a 10% increase decrease in the fair value of the investments will have a favourable unfavourable impact on equity of 3.1 million, of which 0.8 million relates to investments in infrastructure funds.
As discussed above, the fair value of the earn-out agreements included in Level 3 is determined based on a number of unobservable inputs.
A change in one or more of these inputs could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.
On a standalone basis, without the impact of those changes on other variables, changes in the discount rate by - 1% would have an impact of approximately 0.8 million and a change in revenue growth of - 10% would have an impact of approximately 5.6 million on the fair value of the earn-outs respectively.

The Board risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Board has approved the risk appetite statement, which sets out the quantum and types of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its objectives.
The risk appetite statement is a top-down framework against which policies, systems and limits can be set.
The risk committee monitors compliance with the risk appetite statement through a series of key performance indicators.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reports and internal control.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accrued income and derivative financial instruments.
As detailed in note 29, the carrying value of financial instruments approximate their fair value.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of its financial assets.
A breakdown of the Groups relevant financial assets by credit rating is set out below.
As at 30 September 2015 As at 30 September 2014 Not Not AAA AA A BBB BB rated Total AAA AA A BBB rated Total Group m m m m m m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 12.3 252.6 290.0 9.6 0.5 2.7 567.7 26.6 303.3 318.6 4.6 0.8 653.9 Derivative financial assets 29.2 0.4 29.6 Deposits receivable from brokers on derivative contracts 5.6 5.6 Company Cash and cash equivalents 252.2 0.1 252.3 154.0 180.1 334.1 Derivative financial assets 29.2 0.4 29.6 Deposits receivable from brokers on derivative contracts 5.6 5.6 No other relevant financial assets are rated.
138 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Groups treasury policy as approved by the audit committee.
The treasury function manages the cash resources on a daily basis in accordance with the treasury policy, which includes continuously monitoring the credit ratings of all institutions with whom we place deposits.
Similarly, the Group adopts a conservative approach to managing the credit risk from derivatives through the use of exchange traded futures which are fully collateralised in cash, and forward foreign exchange contracts, which typically have a maturity of three months.
Trade receivables and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
Outstanding balances are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
As such, no significant level of default is expected.
An analysis of ageing of financial assets is shown below: As at 30 September 2015 As at 30 September 2014 Past due and not impaired Past due and not impaired Neither Neither past Between Between past Between Between due nor 30 and 90 days due nor 30 and 90 days impaired 90 days and 1 year Total impaired 90 days and 1 year Total Group m m m m m m m m Trade receivables 26.5 11.0 5.1 42.6 34.4 18.0 3.3 55.7 Company Trade receivables 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 All other financial assets are neither past due nor impaired.
Details of provisions against trade receivables at 30 September are as follows: 2015 2014 Group m m Trade receivables provision: Balance at 1 October 0.2 0.7 Bad debt release in the year 0.2 0.5 Balance at 30 September 0.2 Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
The average level of debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, represents approximately 2 months revenue.
At 30 September 2015 the Group had four 2014: four individual clients with greater than 1 million outstanding.
The total outstanding was 19.0 million 2014: 24.1 million.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
Very few clients have external credit ratings.
The Group operates and manages a number of open end funds and in doing so it seeks to match client redemptions with liquidations.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall, although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
com 139 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Further details on liquidity risks are set out in the discussion of principal risks on pages 44 to 51.
The Group has cash balances of 567.7 million at 30 September 2015.
These cash balances provide the Group with adequate liquidity.
The Group and Company financial liabilities, including the Companys overdraft of 466.4 million 2014: 364.0 million, are repayable within one year or on demand, with the exception of the earn-out agreements note 14.
The maximum earn-out payment relating to the SWIP acquisition is 100 million based on the growth delivered by the investment solutions business through its strategic relationship with Lloyds over 5 years.
If targets are achieved, the earn-out is payable between two and five years after completion.
A deferred liability of 35.9 million has been recognised at 30 September 2015 in respect of the earn-out.
The maximum earn-out payment relating to the FLAG acquisition is 29.3 million based on growth of the business over the next 2 years and is payable at the end of that period.
A deferred liability of 10.9 million has been recognised at 30 September 2015 in respect of the earn-out.
The Group has made a commitment to invest up to 28.8 million 2014: 31.2 million in infrastructure funds, denominated in several currencies.
20.4 million of this amount remains committed but not yet drawn 2014: 26.7 million.
Investment calls can be made on demand primarily over the investment periods of the partnerships.
These periods are due to expire in one to four years time.
Once drawn, committed capital remains invested for the life of the funds.
The Group also has undrawn commitments of 18.2 million 2014: 5.0 million in respect of investments in property and private equity funds, which can be called on demand.
iv Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
These financial instruments include the Groups investments in seed capital which are invested to support the launch of new funds.
Seed capital is typically invested in quoted funds for less than one year.
These investments have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments in property and infrastructure funds are usually for longer term and are measured as available for sale.
This can range from five to seven years for property and over ten years for infrastructure.
Investments are managed on an individual basis and all material buy and sell decisions are approved by the GMB.
The objective of market price risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Board sets the limits for investing seed capital and longer term investments and regularly monitors the exposure.
The following financial assets are exposed to market risk: Group Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Held for trading Seed capital 148.9 58.1 102.9 26.6 Financial investments 43.7 27.7 43.4 26.9 Available for sale financial assets Financial investments 34.6 36.6 13.0 9.5 227.2 122.4 159.3 63.0 The Group will consider hedging its exposure to market price risk in respect of seed capital investments, where there is a risk of material price movements and the risk can be hedged effectively.
25.3m of seed capital was hedged against movements in market prices at 30 September 2015 2014: nil.
The Groups defined benefit pension schemes also hold assets which are exposed to market price risk.
Details of these assets are shown in note 33.
140 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Sensitivity analysis is disclosed on page 144, in section vii.
v Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk at a transactional and translational level.
Transaction risk is the risk that the domestic value of a foreign currency denominated cash flow will vary adversely.
Translation risk arises from translating the balances of overseas subsidiaries which report their results in a currency other than sterling and therefore the sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Foreign currency transaction risk The Group undertakes transactions in a number of currencies and foreign currency risk arises through fluctuations in foreign currency rates changing the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.
Revenues are earned principally from fees which are calculated on the basis of the value of AuM managed for clients and many mandates include investments valued in currencies other than sterling.
The fact that we operate on a global basis, with offices in a number of countries worldwide, means that a proportion of operating costs is also incurred in foreign currencies.
Further, coupons on the 7.0% perpetual cumulative capital notes are paid in US dollars.
Variations in the sterling value of these operating costs and dividends will, to an extent, offset any similar impact of fluctuating exchange rates on revenues.
The Board has therefore decided that it is not appropriate to undertake any specific hedging of the Groups revenues or costs.

The Group receives variable rate interest on cash deposits.
The Company has a variable rate overdraft, which is part of the Groups working capital facility.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: market prices are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: and market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% at each reporting date.
The impact of the assumptions on profit or loss and equity, net of tax, are as follows: 144 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Group Impact on Impact profit or on profit Impact on Impact on loss or loss equity equity As at 30 September 2015 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 17.4 17.4 19.8 19.8 Sterling Euro 8.8 8.8 4.5 4.5 Sterling Nordic currencies 1.2 1.2 0.9 0.9 Sterling Singapore dollar 8.7 8.7 11.9 11.9 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 10.7 10.7 Financial investments available for sale 2.6 2.6 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 5.1 5.1 As at 30 September 2014 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 15.9 15.9 15.6 15.6 Sterling Euro 7.5 7.5 4.3 4.3 Sterling Nordic currencies 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 Sterling Singapore dollar 7.4 7.4 9.7 9.7 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 4.8 4.8 Financial investments available for sale 3.0 3.0 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 3.6 3.6 The market price movement sensitivity excludes investments in funds to hedge deferred variable pay liabilities, as described in note 20.
Changes in the market price of these investments are offset by movements in deferred variable pay liabilities, therefore there is no impact on profit or loss.
This also applies to the Company.
The Group and Company interest rate movement sensitivity has been calculated based on average cash balances held during the year.
com 145 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued The sensitivity for market and exchange rate movements for the Group excludes the derivative financial instruments and related seed capital, as described in note 29.
The change in the derivative financial instruments is offset by movements in the related seed capital investments and therefore there is no material impact on profit or loss.
This does not apply to the Company as the seed capital is held in another Group subsidiary.
The effect of the derivative financial instruments is reflected in the Company sensitivity analysis in the following table: Company Impact on Impact on profit or profit or Impact on Impact on loss loss equity equity As at 30 September 2015 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency 1 Sterling US dollar 0.9 0.9 Sterling Euro 1.6 1.6 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% 2 Financial investments held for trading 6.5 6.5 Financial investments available for sale 0.9 0.9 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 1.6 1.6 As at 30 September 2014 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 1.1 1.1 Sterling Euro 0.7 0.7 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 2.2 2.2 Financial investments available for sale 0.5 0.5 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 2.4 2.4 1 Excluding forward foreign exchange contracts, the profit or loss impact would be -3.2m 2 Excluding equity futures, the profit or loss impact would be -8.6m 146 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements viii Capital management The Boards policy with respect to capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to provide a sufficient base to sustain the future development of the business while at the same time ensuring compliance with all regulatory capital requirements.
The Board receives regular updates on headroom over regulatory capital and supervises key decisions that may impact the future capital position of the Group.
Further information on the Groups regulatory capital position is given below.
The Groups capital structure consists of equity share capital and share premium of 1,030.5 million, retained earnings, 500 million perpetual capital notes and 100 million preference shares.
The perpetual capital notes and preference shares satisfy the requirements of financial reporting standards for treatment as equity and the perpetual capital notes are treated as an element of Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.
The preference shares are treated as Additional Tier 1 capital.
The Group uses cash generated from its operations to pay a progressive dividend.
The Board seeks to avoid further dilutive issuance of new shares and has, since 2010, satisfied vesting of deferred variable pay awards by purchasing shares in the market through the EBT.
The EBT now holds sufficient shares to cover all outstanding awards as at 30 September 2015.
Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD IV, as implemented in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital.
In common with many other independent asset managers, the Group had operated under the terms of a waiver from the requirement to meet the full consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver was granted by the FCA with effect from January 2007 and remained in place until August 2014.
The Group achieved its objective of eliminating reliance on this waiver and chose not to apply for a renewal of the waiver.
The Group is required to undertake an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, under which the Board quantifies the level of capital required to meet operational risks: this is referred to as the Pillar 2 capital requirement.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks which may not be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing for the effects of major risks, such as those discussed on pages 44 to 51.
These tests consider how the Group would cope with a significant market downturn, for example, and include an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
31 Related party transactions In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiary undertakings carry out transactions with related parties, as defined by IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Material transactions for the year are set out below.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company are shown in note 34.
During the year, the Group entered into the following transactions with related parties: a Compensation of key management personnel of the Group 2015 2014 m m Short term employee benefits 14.2 11.2 Share-based payments 16.4 14.9 Pension contributions 0.5 0.7 Total 31.1 26.8 More detailed information concerning directors remuneration is provided in the audited part of the remuneration report on pages 72 to 88. aberdeen-asset.

In return the Group receives management fees for provision of these services.
Details of the fees received and outstanding at 30 September are provided in note 32.
148 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 32 Interests in structured entities A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group has assessed whether the funds it manages are structured entities, through review of the above factors.
The Group considers the following as structured entities Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Socits dInvestissement Capital Variable SICAVs, Unit Trusts, Fonds Communs fide Placement FCPs, and certain mutual funds, limited partnerships and other pooled funds.
Segregated mandates managed on behalf of clients and investment trusts are not considered structured entities.
The structured entities are generally financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors, although certain funds, mainly property, infrastructure and private equity funds, are also permitted to raise finance through loans from third parties.
The Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings held by these entities.
The structured entities allow clients to invest in a portfolio of assets in order to provide a return through capital appreciation and or investment income.
Accordingly, they are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the assets they hold.
Market risks are discussed further in note 30.
In certain cases, the Group will also purchase units or shares for the purpose of providing seed capital or to hedge against liabilities from deferred variable pay awards.
There are no differences in the rights attached to the equity held by the Group from those held by other investors.
As described in note 30, the Group may also commit to invest capital in certain property, infrastructure and private equity funds.
AuM within consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities is shown below: 2015 AuM Type of entity bn 1 Consolidated structured entities Seed capital investments 0.1 Assets backing investment contract liabilities 1.9 Unconsolidated structured entities: Open-ended funds 71.7 Closed-end funds 3.2 Outside of structured entities 206.8 Total 283.7 1 Includes AuM in relation to funds the Group is deemed to control through seed capital investments which are consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10, and the assets held by the Groups life and pensions subsidiary to meet its contracted liabilities.
The exposure to the risks and rewards of the assets held by the Groups life and pensions subsidiary is borne by the underlying policyholders see note 19 The Group has an interest in the structured entities listed above through the receipt of management fees based on a percentage of the net asset value and, in certain funds, contractually agreed performance fees, as well as investment returns where the Group has an equity holding in the entity.
Gross revenue includes 655.3m of fees received from structured entities managed by the Group, of which 573.5m 2014: 358.4m relates to related parties.
In addition, the Group recognised a net loss on seed capital and other investments held in structured entities of 9.4m during the year.
The table below summarises the carrying values in the balance sheet, representing the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities, as at 30 September 2015: 2015 Total Open-ended funds Closed-end funds m m m 2,3 Trade and other receivables 387.0 383.7 3.3 2 Trade and other payables 317.2 317.2 Other investments current 101.1 101.1 Investments non-current 23.8 9.8 14.0 2 Includes 309.2m receivable and 309.6m payable in connection with the creation and redemption of units in open ended funds, which are settled within a short time frame.
Associated risks are discussed in note 30 3 Includes 55.0m 2014:41.8m outstanding from funds also deemed related parties aberdeen-asset.
com 149 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Interests in structured entities continued Maximum exposure to loss The Group does not have a direct exposure to the AuM it manages, with the associated risks and rewards residing with external investors, except where the Group holds an equity interest.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss is therefore limited to future fee income and the carrying value of assets relating to structured entities at each reporting date, as highlighted above, where the net asset value of the entities is reduced through withdrawals by investors and or adverse performance.
In addition, 24.3m of the Groups unfunded capital commitments described in note 30 iii relates to unconsolidated structured entities invested in property and infrastructure projects.
Financial support The Group has not provided financial support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entity through guarantees over the repayment of borrowings, or otherwise, and has no contractual obligations or current intention of providing financial support in the future.
The Group did however invest an additional 123.5m in seed capital during the year to 30 September 2015, in order to support the launch of new funds classified as structured entities.
33 Retirement benefits The Groups principal form of pension provision is by way of defined contribution schemes operated worldwide.
The Group also operates a small number of legacy defined benefit schemes including: the Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan, the Edinburgh Fund Managers Group plc Retirement & Death Benefits Scheme and the DEGI Pension Plan.
These defined benefit schemes are closed to new membership and to future service accrual.
The main defined benefit schemes in the UK are based on final salary payments with benefits being adjusted in line with the schemes rules once in payment after retirement.
The level of benefits paid is dependent on a members length of service and salary prior to retirement.
A funding plan, which aims to eliminate any shortfall in funding, has been agreed between the Trustees of the schemes and the employer.
Annual contributions to the UK schemes under these funding plans are currently 11.1 million.
The defined benefit schemes operated by the Group expose the Group to actuarial risks, including longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Where appropriate, the investment strategy takes the make up of the schemes membership into account for example investing in assets that broadly aim to partially match some of the liability outflows, which reduces the effect of market movements on funding levels.
Risk in relation to gilt yields has also been mitigated by investing a proportion of the schemes assets in gilts bonds LDI assets.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset allocation, to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
