British American Tobacco Annual Report 2015 149 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 9 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill Goodwill of 9,324 million 2014: 9,842 million is included in intangible assets in the Group Balance Sheet of which the following are the significant acquisitions: Rothmans Group 4,131 million 2014: 4,384 million : Imperial Tobacco Canada 1,964 million 2014: 2,223 million : ETI Italy 1,216 million 2014: 1,280 million and ST principally Scandinavia 913 million 2014: 963 million.
The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Eastern Europe, Western Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export markets in the UK and operations in Asia-Pacific.
In 2015 and 2014, goodwill was allocated for impairment testing purposes to 14 individual cash-generating units five in Asia-Pacific, five in the Americas, two in Western Europe and two in EEMEA.
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of Canada 1,964 million 2014: 2,223 million, Western Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 3,249 million 2014: 3,388 million, Eastern Europe includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 832 million 2014: 851 million, South Africa 485 million 2014: 614 million, Australia includes Rothmans and other acquisitions 661 million 2014: 703 million, Singapore 511 million 2014: 517 million and Malaysia 372 million 2014: 432 million are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of all cash-generating units have been determined on a value-in-use basis.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amounts of all units are the budgeted volumes, operating margins and long-term growth rates, which directly impact the cash flows, and the discount rates used in the calculation.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made.
These adjustments are derived from external sources and are based on the spread between bonds or credit default swaps, or similar indicators issued by the US or comparable governments and by the local government, adjusted for the Groups own credit market risk.
For ease of use and consistency in application, these results are periodically calibrated into bands based on internationally recognised credit ratings.
The long-term growth rates and discount rates have been applied to the budgeted cash flows of each cash-generating unit.
These cash flows have been determined by local management based on experience, specific market and brand trends, pricing expectations and costs, and have been endorsed by Group management as part of the consolidated Group budget.
The valuations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a one-year period, with growth in year 2 of 5% 2014: 5%.
Cash flows for the years 3 to 10 are extrapolated from year 2 cash flows of each relevant operating unit at 4% 2014: 4% per annum, including 1% 2014: 1% inflation, where after a total growth rate of 2% 2014: 2% per annum including 2% 2014: 2% inflation has been assumed.
The extrapolated growth rates are considered conservative given the Groups history of profit and cash growth, its well balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates.
The long-term real growth does not exceed the expected long-term average growth rate for the combined markets in which the cash-generating units operate.
In some instances, such as recent acquisitions, start-up ventures or in other specific cases, the valuation is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of the country or market management, spanning five years or beyond.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 7.2% and 14.7% 2014: 7.2% to 15.0% were used, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for economic and political risks.
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 8.5% for Canada 2014: 8.5%, 8.6% for Western Europe 2014: 8.6%, 8.5% for Eastern Europe 2014: 8.5%, 9.6% for South Africa 2014: 9.6%, 8.6% for Australia 2014: 8.6%, 7.2% for Singapore 2014: 7.2% and 8.7% for Malaysia 2014: 8.7%.
If discounted cash flows for cash-generating units should fall by 10%, or the discount rate was increased at a post-tax rate of 1%, there would be no impairment.
