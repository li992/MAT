In addition, there is an increase of 1 billion in forecast future cash ows in respect of contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012.
These increases are partially offset by a reduction of 2.6 billion in forecast future cash ows for repayment of debt and debt interest.
The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows for the Groups derivative instruments, excluding embedded derivatives and equity options which are not material, using undiscounted cash ows.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
The gross cash ows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purposes of this table although, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have decreased compared to 31 December 2014 due to the maturity of the foreign exchange contracts that were hedging the US dollar proceeds of the Novartis transaction.

The granting of these restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the schemes more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
The Group also operates savings related share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc at a discounted price.
Grants of restricted share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting or performance period.
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc but in some circumstances may be settled in cash.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Options under historical share option schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
The total charge for share-based incentive plans in 2015 was 349 million 2014 346 million: 2013 319 million.
Of this amount, 307 million 2014 302 million: 2013 243 million arose from the Share Value Plan.

The awards vest after two and a half to three years and there are no performance criteria attached.
The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield of 5.7% 2014 5.2%: 2013 5.0% over the duration of the award.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a dened measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted from 2014 to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.
These are adjusted free cash ow, TSR and R&D new product performance.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees the performance conditions are based on both GSKs EPS growth compared with the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period and adjusted free cash ow.
In addition, some businesses have an element of their award based on a strategic or operational business measure, over a three year measurement period, specic to the employees business area.
The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant.
For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant.
During 2015, awards were made of 4.6 million shares at a weighted fair value of 12.19 and 1.3 million ADS at a weighted fair value of $37.27.
At 31 December 2015, there were outstanding awards over 13.2 million shares and 3.5 million ADS.
Share options and savings-related options For the purposes of valuing options and savings-related options to arrive at the share based payment charge, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Risk-free interest rate 0.88% 0.7% 0.7% Dividend yield 6.5% 5.8% 5.3% Volatility 21% 19% 20% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Savings-related options grant price including 20% discount 10.14 11.31 12.47 GSK Annual Report 2015 203
