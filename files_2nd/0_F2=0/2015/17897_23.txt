5 Segment analysis Reportable segments of the Group: Construction Services activities resulting in the physical construction of an asset Support Services activities which support existing assets or functions such as asset maintenance and refurbishment Infrastructure Investments acquisition, operation and disposal of infrastructure assets such as roads, hospitals, schools, student accommodation, military housing, offshore transmission networks, waste and biomass and other concessions.
This segment now also includes the Groups housing development division which has moved from Construction Services.
Rail Germany was reclassified from discontinued operations in 2014 and its performance was included within non-underlying items as part of continuing operations.
The Group has continued to present Rail Germany outside of underlying items as it remains committed to exiting its Mainland European rail businesses as soon as possible and does not consider its operations part of the Groups underlying activity.
When initially classified as a discontinued operation on 28 June 2013 the German business was being marketed to be sold as an entire unit.
Subsequently it became apparent that this would not be possible and disposal of part of the business was agreed in November 2014.
As a result, Rail Germany did not satisfy the criteria under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations for it to remain as a discontinued operation in 2014.
In 2014, the performance of external Engineering Services ES contracts linked to poor legacy management and in regions that ES has withdrawn from tendering for third-party work was also included in non-underlying items as the size and nature of the losses due to the problematic delivery of these contracts are exceptional and distort the underlying performance of the Group.
ES has stopped bidding external work in London, South East and the South West.
At 31 December 2015, two of these contracts were still active and currently scheduled to complete in May 2016.
Separate disclosure of these contracts aids the readers understanding of the underlying performance of the remainder of the Group.
Performance on these contracts including any claims recovery will continue to be presented in non-underlying items through to their completion.

12 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale Rail disposal group In 2013, following a strategic review in light of low activity levels and the commoditisation of work, the Group decided to divest all of its Mainland European rail businesses over time.
The Group had been actively marketing its Mainland European rail businesses and accordingly, when it was probable that these businesses would be sold within a year, or were sold or abandoned, they met the criteria to be classified as an asset held for sale.
To also be classified as discontinued, an operation must represent a separate major line of business.
Other than the Mainland European rail businesses there were no significant Group operations in Mainland Europe and therefore by exiting these businesses, the Group was exiting from a separate major geographical operation and they met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.
On 8 January 2014 the Group disposed of its Rail business in Scandinavia for a cash consideration of 2m.
The disposal resulted in a nil gain being recognised as a non-underlying item, comprising a nil gain loss in respect of the fair value of net assets disposed, including cash disposed of 9m, a 1m gain on recycling currency translation reserves to the income statement, and costs incurred and indemnity provisions of 1m.
On 27 June 2014, following progression of talks with potential purchasers, it became highly probable that Rail Italy would be disposed within a year and met the criteria to be classified as an asset held for sale.
Accordingly a 24m goodwill impairment charge was recognised in the year as a non-underlying item.
On 11 March 2015, the Group completed the sale of Rail Italy for a net consideration of 3m.
In 2014, Rail Germany was reclassified from discontinued operations and its performance was included within non-underlying items as part of continuing operations.
The Group has presented Rail Germany outside of underlying items as it remains committed to exiting its Mainland European rail businesses as soon as possible and does not consider its operations part of the Groups underlying activity.
As aresult, Rail Germany did not satisfy the criteria under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations for it to remain as a discontinued operation in 2014.
However, the parts of Rail Germany which were subject to sale to Rhomberg Sersa Rail Group at December 2014 were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2014.
The sale subsequently completed in January 2015.
There are no remaining operations within the Rail disposal group classified as discontinued operations or held for sale at 31 December 2015 following completion of the sales of parts of Rail Germany on 31 January 2015 and of Rail Italy on 11 March 2015.
The Rail disposal group was part of the Construction Services segment.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 117 12 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale continued Parsons Brinckerhoff On 28 October 2014, shareholder approval was granted for the disposal of the Groups 100% interest in Parsons Brinckerhoff.
The deal subsequently completed on 31 October 2014 for an agreed cash consideration of 812m.
The disposal resulted in a net non-underlying gainof 234m being recognised within discontinued operations in 2014.
In accordance with the stock purchase agreement, theGroup received cash of 20m relating to historic tax matters 16m of which was recognised as a current tax receivable in the prior period and the Group also released an indemnity provision relating to an historic legal claim of 3m which was successfully settled during the period.
Offsetting this additional non-underlying gain on disposal are separation costs incurred during the period of 4m, of which 2m were paid during the period, and the write-off of a deferred tax asset of 7m resulting in an overall net gain of 5m.

Construction Services UK has now been split into UK Regional and Engineering Services and Major Projects, the latter being included in Other.
Support Services has also been split into Rail UK, Gas & Water and Power, the latter being included in Other.
Balfour Beatty Communities US is now being shown separately from Other.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value-in-use, a key input of which is forecast cash flows.
The Groups cash flow forecasts are based on the expected workload of each cash-generating unit CGU, giving consideration to the current level of confirmed and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups Three Year Plan, which covers the period from 2016 to 2018 and includes a stabilisation of performance in the Construction Services UK business.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU were compiled from each of its constituent business units as part of the Groups annual financial planning process.
It is anticipated that the UK construction market will grow modestly over the forecast period, with improvements in tender margins.
It isanticipated that the US construction market will continue to improve, as will tender margins.
In the Support Services segment, market conditions are anticipated to be stable in the UK.
The Support Services business has a portfolio of long-term contracts and has secured the majority of its workload for the forecast period.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its long-term growth rate and discount rate.
The discount rates have been calculated usingthe Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC method, which takes account of the Groups capital structure financial risk as well asthe nature of each CGUs business operational risk.
Long-term growth rates are assumed to be the estimated future GDP growth rates based on published independent forecasts for the country or countries in which each CGU operates, less 1.0% to reflect current economic uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure.
In the derivation of each CGUs value-in-use, a terminal value is assumed based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The multiple is applied to a terminal cash flow, which is the normalised cash flow in the last year of the forecast period.
The EBIT multiple iscalculated using the Gordon Growth Model and is a factor of the discount rate and growth rate for each CGU.
The nominal terminal value is discounted to present value.

Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used.
The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.
In light of the significant losses incurred within the UK construction business in 2015 the Group has considered whether a reasonable possible change in assumptions would lead to an impairment of the goodwill in the related CGUs and concluded that it is not the case.
The stabilisation and recovery of the Groups UK construction business to more normal levels of performance is however a key assumption underpinning the cash flow forecasts used to assess the recoverable amount of the related goodwill.
Except as noted below, a reasonable possible change in a single assumption will not give rise to an impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.3% and nominal long-term growth rate of 2.8% the recoverable amount of the remaining goodwill in Gas& Water is 67m based on value-in-use, with consequent headroom of 9m.
A 1.0% increase in the discount rate and a 1.0% reduction in the growth rate would lead to an impairment of 22m.

The project to design, build and maintain postgraduate accommodation at the University of Edinburgh is nearing completion of the construction phase, with the first rooms occupied by students from September 2015.
Additional spend of 23m 2014: 28m was incurred in the year in respect of this project.
Software and other primarily comprises software of the UK shared service centre and operating companies with a cost of 116m 2014: 100m and accumulated amortisation and impairment of 67m 2014: 43m, including internally generated software with a cost of77m 2014: 75m and accumulated amortisation and impairment of 42m 2014: 34m.
In 2015, an impairment charge of 17m was recognised against software intangible assets relating to costs capitalised in the transformation of the Groups UK IT estate from a federated to a more centralised model.
Due to curtailments in the scope of the implementation and the Groups termination of its agreement with its implementation partner, future benefits expected to be generated from this asset arereduced.
The impairment was recognised as a non-underlying charge.
An impairment charge of 27m was recognised in 2014 relating to the impairment of the Oracle R12 asset.
This charge was recognised within non-underlying items.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are one to four years for customer contracts, three to 10 years for customer relationships, three to seven years for software, and up to five years for brand names, except for customer contracts and relationships relating to Balfour Beatty Investments North America which are amortised on a basis matching the returns earned over the life of the underlying contracts and relationships.
These contracts have a duration of up to 50 years for customer contracts relating to  North America.
The Infrastructure Investments intangible is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the project which is 50 years.
The software for the UK shared service centre and operating companies is amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its sevenyear life.
The Groups remaining knowledge sharing and collaboration software is amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its five-year life.
Other intangible assets are amortised over periods up to 10 years.

Upon completion, these buildings were transferred out of assets in the course of construction to be classified within infrastructure leasehold improvements.
Both buildings are held under short leaseholds and are depreciated over 40 years.
In 2015, phase 2 commenced on the student accommodation project in Iowa resulting in capital expenditure of 9m.
Construction is still in progress on this development and therefore it has been classified as assets in the course of construction.
Additional land purchase of 4m also occurred in 2015.
Construction on this land will take place in 2016.
The carrying amount of the Groups plant and equipment held under finance leases was 1m 2014: 1m.
The Company has no property, plant and equipment held under finance leases.
Except for land and assets in the course of construction, the costs of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum or over the term of the lease, and plant and equipment is depreciated at 4% to 33% per annum.

# Represents the combined results of BK Gulf LLC and Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC as both joint ventures have common ownership and report under the same management structure.
The principal joint ventures and associates are shown in Note 39.
The original cost of the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates was 80m 2014: 123m.
The Groups share of borrowings of joint ventures and associates is shown in Note 18.2.
The amount which was supported by the Group and the Company was 20m 2014: 10m, relating to the Groups share of guaranteed borrowings.
The non-recourse borrowings of joint venture and associate entities relating to infrastructure concessions projects are repayable over periods extending up to 2046.
The non-recourse borrowings arise under facilities taken out by project specific joint venture and associate concession companies.
The borrowings of each concession company are secured by a combination of fixed and floating charges over that concession companys interests in its projects assets and revenues and the shares in the concession company held by its immediate Parent Company.
A significant part of these loans has been swapped into fixed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps.
As disclosed in Note 39f, the Group has committed to provide its share of further equity funding of joint ventures and associates in Infrastructure Investments projects and military housing concessions.
Further, in respect of a number of these investments the Group has committed not to dispose of its equity interest until construction is complete.
As is customary in such projects, banking covenants restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions.

26.3 Convertible bonds On 3 December 2013, the Group issued convertible bonds of 100,000 each maturing on 3 December 2018 at a total issue price of 252.7m and incurred transaction costs of 6.7m resulting in net proceeds of 246m.
The bonds have a coupon of 1.875% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears and the initial conversion price has been set at 3.6692 per share.
On 23 April 2014, the conversion price was revised to 3.6212.
From 14 January 2014 until 14 days prior to final maturity, one bond is convertible at the option of the holder into one preference share in Balfour Beatty Finance No 2 Ltd which is immediately transferred to the Company in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares in the Company.
The Group has the option to redeem the bonds from December 2015 under certain circumstances.
The bonds are compound instruments, comprising equity and liability components.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was 220m estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 4.29% per annum for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the net proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds after the transaction costs and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders funds.

11m 2014: 7m will expire between five and 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2016.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets for UK corporation tax trading losses of 14m 2014: 55m.
Given the losses recorded in the period, the Group has reassessed the period used in its assessment of future taxable profits to support the recoverability of both the temporary differences and these tax losses.
The impact of this reassessment was a reduction in the deferred tax asset of 32m.
The Group has UK corporation tax trading losses of 709m 2014: 376m which are not recognised as deferred tax assets.
At the reporting date the undistributed reserves for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised were 1m 2014: 7m in respect of subsidiaries and nil 2014: 2m in respect of joint ventures and associates.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Groups control and no distribution which gives rise to taxation is contemplated.

Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligation is to provide specified benefits on retirement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 prescribes the accounting for defined benefit schemes in the Groups financial statements.
Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on high-quality corporate bonds.
The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net finance cost arising from the expected interest income on plan assets and interest cost on scheme obligations is included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the Statement ofComprehensive Income.
The IAS 19 accounting valuations are set out in Note 28.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds as required by IAS 19 for the financial statements.
Details of the latest formal triennial funding valuations are set out in Note 28.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets of, the Group.
Principal schemes The Groups principal schemes are the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined contribution and defined benefit sections, and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The defined benefit sections of both schemes are funded and closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has transferred to the Group under certain agreed arrangements.
Pension benefits are based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the trust deed and rules and relevant legislation.
The trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufficient assets to meet the cost of current and future benefits.
These schemes expose the Group to investment and actuarial risks where additional contributions may be required if assets are not sufficient to pay future pension benefits: investment risk: Equity returns are a key determinant of investment return but the investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the investments held, for example, credit risk on corporate bond holdings.
actuarial risk: The ultimate cost of providing pension benefits is affected by inflation rates and members life expectancy.
The net present value of the obligations is affected by the market yield on high-quality corporate bonds used to discount the obligations.
Changes in the principal actuarial assumptions based on market data, such as inflation and the discount rate, and experience, such as life expectancy, expose the Group to fluctuations in the net IAS 19 liability and the net finance cost.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 139 28 Retirement benefit liabilities continued 28.1 Introduction continued Balfour Beatty Pension Fund The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth.
The BBPF invests partly in a diversified range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the obligations.
The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market and emerging market equities.
The remaining BBPF assets are principally fixed and index-linked bonds and swaps in order to match the duration and inflation exposure of the obligations and enhance the resilience of the funding level of the scheme.
The performance of the assets is measured against market indices.
A formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013.
As a result, the Group agreed with effect from April 2013, to make ongoing deficit payments of 50m per annum, increasing to: 55m per annum from April 2016: 60m per annum from April 2017: and 65m per annum from April 2018 to May 2020, increasing each year by CPI minimum 0% and capped at 5% plus in the period before the next actuarial valuation is agreed 200% of any increase in the Companys dividend in excess of capped CPI.
If the Company makes any one-off return of value to shareholders in excess of 200m such as a special dividend, share buy-back, capital payment or similar before the next actuarial valuation is agreed, there will be an additional increase in the deficit payment for the following year only, calculated as the regular deficit payment for that year multiplied by 75%, multiplied by the value of the one-off return of value, divided by the total of the regular dividends for the year prior to the year in which the one-off return was made.
This agreement constitutes a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Under the terms of the trust deed and subject to the agreement of the trustees who would need to balance their responsibility to set contribution rates in accordance with the trust rules together with the interests of the beneficiaries at the time, the Group has the ability to use surplus funds, should they arise, in the defined benefit section of the BBPF to pay its contributions towards further service benefits in the defined benefit and defined contribution sections of the scheme.
The Directors consider that, as the Group is permitted to assume that it would not be required to make contributions to maintain a surplus, should one arise, these further service benefits will exceed the minimum funding requirement.
In 2014, the Group commenced a commutation exercise for pensioner members and dependants with benefits with a value of less than 30,000 and 18,000, respectively.
This gave those members the option to extinguish their benefits within the BBPF in exchange for a cash lump sum.
The acceptance of this offer by certain members and dependants gave rise to a settlement event resulting in a decrease inliabilities of 3m 2014: 2m, which was recognised in other non-underlying items.
In anticipation of the disposal of Parsons Brinckerhoff and the then proposed 200m return of capital to shareholders, and following the scheme apportionment arrangement made in relation to the disposal of Balfour Beatty WorkPlace, agreement was reached on 24 September 2014 with the trustees of the BBPF for additional deficit payments of 100m in 2015, of which 15m was in respect of Balfour Beatty WorkPlace and 85m was in respect of Parsons Brinckerhoff.
The 15m was paid to the BBPF in 2015 in agreed monthly instalments.
On 1 July 2015, the Group established a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP structure into which its investment in Consort Healthcare Birmingham Holdings Ltd Consort Birmingham, which owns the Groups 40% interest in the Birmingham Hospital PFI investment, was transferred.
The BBPF is a partner in the SLP and is entitled to a share of the income of the SLP.
In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the SLP is deemed to be controlled by the Group, which retains the ability to substitute the investment in Consort Birmingham for other investments from time to time.
Alongside the establishment of the SLP, agreement was reached to defer the payment of 85m which had been due to be paid to the BBPF in 2015 over the period to 2023, with the first payment of 4m due in 2016.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the BBPF in the SLP does not constitute a plan asset and therefore the pension deficit presented in these financial statements does not reflect the BBPFs interest in the SLP.
Distributions from the SLP to the BBPF will be reflected in the Groups financial statements as pension contributions on a cash basis.
The first distribution was received in December 2015 and amounted to 1m.
The next formal triennial valuation of the BBPF will be as at 31 March 2016.
The Company and the trustees are in the early stages of preparing for this valuation.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 140 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28 Retirement benefit liabilities continued 28.1 Introduction continued Railways Pension Scheme The RPS is a shared cost scheme.
The legal responsibility of the Group in the RPS is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
In 2013 and previous years, the assumed cost of providing benefits was split between the Group and the members in the ratio 60:40.
This had been a reasonable assumption to make of how costs might have been shared over the long term.
In 2014, because of a declining population of active members, it became less likely that the costs of providing benefits borne by the Group would be capped in line with its economic interest of 60%.
Based on discussions arising from the 2013 valuation process, it was expected that members might only be able to afford to fund 5% of the scheme deficit.
In the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014, the long-term cost of providing benefits was assumed to be split between the Group and the members in the ratio 95:5.
This assumption remains valid for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The balance sheet asset and liability disclosed, therefore, are equal to 95% of the totalscheme asset and liability.
Any future surplus or deficit is assumed to be split in this manner.
The RPS invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and income and as determined by the trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the trustees attitude to risk.
The majority of the RPS assets that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled growth fund.
This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time.
The remaining assets in the RPS are principally fixed and index-linked bonds.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation carried out as at 31 December 2010, the Group agreed to make ongoing fixed deficit contributions of 1.3m per annum plus an additional 1% of the active members payroll costs.
The triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2013 continues to progress.
The valuation has been subject to delays as the deficit is likely to have increased substantially and the shared cost nature of the scheme means that the impact of any of the trustees funding decisions on members needs to be considered very carefully.
Other schemes Other schemes comprise unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which are closed to new entrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the US, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 19.1 in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate benefit of the employees but are available to the Groups creditors in the event of insolvency.

com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 158 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 38 Financial instruments continued 38.2 Group continued Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, forspeculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability in Infrastructure Investments concessions arising from variable interest rates on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks since 2014. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirates dirhams.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Whenever acurrent or future foreign currency exposure is identified with sufficient reliability Group Treasury enters into forward contracts onbehalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial Officer.
Refer to page 156 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures.
As at 31 December 2015, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 35m 2014: 176m receivable and 36m 2014: 181m payable with related cash flows expected to occur in up to two 2014: three years.
The foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from fair valuing these unhedged foreign exchange contracts will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of nil 2014: 2m receivable and nil 2014: 2m payable as cash flow hedges against highly probable cash flows which are expected to occur in up to one 2014: two year.
Fair value gains on these contracts of nil 2014: nil have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive income.
The cumulative amount deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at the reporting date is nil 2014: nil.
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any foreign exchange cash flow hedges.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks.
The Group does not enter into forward foreign exchange or other derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets.
In March 2013, the Group raised US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge against changes in the value of the Groups US net assets due to exchange movements.
The Group has reassessed this hedge and has concluded that the hedge continues to be effective.
Exchange movements in the year totalled 12m 2014: 12m.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
At the reporting date there had been no change to the hedging policies since 2014.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 159 38 Financial instruments continued 38.2 Group continued ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups Infrastructure Investments concessions which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy to manage this risk is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swap contracts.
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curve at the reporting date.
During 2015 and 2014, the Groups infrastructure concessions subsidiaries borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2015 totalled 304m 2014: 419m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 25 years.
At 31 December 2015, the fixed interest rates range from 3.5% to 5.1% 2014: 3.5% to 5.1% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR plus a fixed margin.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 20m increase 2014: 3m 24m decrease 2014: 4m in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group in relation to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and other borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a 2m decrease 2014: nil 1m 2014: nil increase in the Groups net finance cost.
iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its Infrastructure Investments concessions.
At the commencement of the concession, an element of the unitary payment by the customer is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
The Group is exposed to price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and deposits, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments, the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are independently rated with a minimum long-term credit rating of BBB.
At 31 December 2015, 5m 2014: 13m did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board of Directors for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables, credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Groups most significant customers are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at the reporting date is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 26.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out on page 157.
Fair value estimation The Group holds certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability in accordance with the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1 The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group  investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price atthe reporting date.
Level 2 The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, eitherdirectly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising yield curves at the reporting date and taking into account own credit risk.
Own credit risk for Infrastructure Investments swaps is not material and is calculated using the following credit valuation adjustment CVA calculation: loss given default multiplied by exposure multiplied by probability of default.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Own credit risk for the other derivative liabilities is not material and is calculated by applying a relevant credit default swap CDS rate obtained from a third party.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 160 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 38 Financial instruments continued 38.2 Group continued Level 3 The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.
PPP financial assets The fair value of the Groups PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin by reference to the construction margin on non-PPP projects reflecting the construction risks retained by the construction contractor, and fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets, with marketrelated movements in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and other movements recognised in the income statement.
Amounts originally recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement upon disposal of the asset.
Investment in the Infrastructure Fund The Groups investment in the Infrastructure Fund the Fund is subject to the terms and conditions of the Funds offering documentation.
The investment in the Fund is primarily valued based on the latest available financial information provided by the Funds General Partner, which is a related party of the Group.
Management reviews the details of the reported valuation obtained from the Fund and considers: i the valuation of the underlying investments: ii the value date of the net asset value NAV provided: iii cash flows calls distributions since the latest value date: and iv the basis of accounting and, in instances where the basis of accounting is other than fair value, fair value information provided by the Funds General Partner.
Where the information provided by the Funds General Partner is not considered appropriate, management will make amendments to the NAV obtained as noted above in order to present a carrying value that more appropriately reflects the fair value of the Groups investment at the reporting date.
In determining the continued appropriateness of the valuation, management reviews the valuation reports received from the Funds General Partner.
The terms of the Funds partnership agreement require these valuation reports to be supported by an annual external valuation.

Refer to Note 20 for a reconciliation of the movement from the opening balance to the closing balance.
Investment in the Infrastructure Fund Management has determined that an absolute shift of 15% represents a reasonably possible change in the fair value of the Groups investment in the Fund and would result in an absolute change of 6m 2014: 3m.
In arriving at this value, management have considered the economic assumptions and discount rates used in the valuation of the underlying investments.
Refer to Note 18.6 for a reconciliation of the movement from the opening balance to the closing balance.
At 31 December 2015, management considered that the NAV provided by the Funds General Partner appropriately reflected the fair value of the Groups investment.

The Companys external forward foreign exchange contracts hedge the currency risk on foreign currency loans entered into with Group companies or are offset by forward foreign exchange contracts with the Groups operating companies where Group Treasury is hedging the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities on their behalf.
ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 4m 2014: 8m increase decrease in the Companys net finance cost.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to UK interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to other comprehensive income.

Due to delays in achieving planning, UBB Waste Gloucestershire Ltd reached a second financial close in January 2016. e Balfour Beatty Investments North America Military housing Summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number of US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 55 US government military bases which includes 55 military family housing communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 42,800 housing units once development, construction and renovation are complete.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, seven projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project with the Army at Fort Stewart.
Contractual arrangements The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, could potentially extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50-year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCsleasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual minimum preferred rate of return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
com AR2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 167 39 Principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates continued e Balfour Beatty Investments North America continued Military housing continued Allocation of remaining operating cash flows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment account held by the project for the benefit of the government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to 18% depending on the particular project and the type of return annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions will have the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds willtypically be distributed to the applicable military service.

ii The share of results of the military housing joint ventures of Balfour Beatty Communities is limited to a pre-agreed preferred return on funds invested.
The Group evaluated each of its interests in the military housing projects to determine if the entities should be consolidated.
This analysis included, but was not limited to, identifying the activities that most significantly impact an entitys economic performance, which party or parties control those activities and the risks associated with these entities.
Decision making power over key facets of the contracts were evaluated when determining which party or parties had control over the activities that most significantly impacted a projects economics.
Based on this review, the Directors consider that the Group does not have the power to direct these activities and does not have control and therefore the Group does not consolidate the military housing projects.
