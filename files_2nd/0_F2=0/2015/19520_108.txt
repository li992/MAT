The ABI Pension Fund, Suncrush Pension Fund and Suncrush Retirement Fund are funded schemes of the defined benefit type based on average salary with assets held in separately administered funds.
The governance of the schemes is the responsibility of the boards of trustees on behalf ofthe members, subject to the provisions of local legislation and the rules for each scheme.
The ABI Pension Fund no longer has any active or pensioner members.
There are surplus assets remaining in the scheme that will be distributed toformer members.
The Suncrush Pension Fund has pensioners where the pension liabilities have been outsourced to an insurance provider.
The trustees have made aprovision in the fund rules for the active members such that benefits will be paid to members on exit for their benefits valued as at 1 July 2005.
Nofurther benefits are being accrued for active members.
The Suncrush Retirement Fund has no liabilities and is the process of being closed down.
Risks The most significant risks the group is exposed to through its defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical plans are as follows.
Volatility of investment returns Those schemes that hold assets are exposed to volatility in investment returns on those assets, which may be higher or lower than the assumed expected return on those assets.
Asset mix is varied for each individual scheme to ensure investment volatility risk is appropriately managed.
Salary, pension and healthcare cost inflation risk Scheme liabilities for the defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans are calculated based on assumed rates of salary, pension and or healthcare cost inflation.
Increases in these inflation rates will lead to higher liabilities.
Change in discount rate A decrease in corporate bond yields will result in a decrease in the discount rate and therefore an increase in scheme liabilities.
This will be partially offset by an increase in the value of plan assets where the scheme holds bonds.
Mortality rates The majority of the groups obligations to provide benefits under both the defined benefit pension plans and medical and other post-retirement benefits are for the life of the member.
Increases in life expectancy will result in increases in the scheme liabilities associated with the schemes.
The group ensures mortality rate assumptions incorporated in the actuarial calculations of the present value of scheme liabilities are from reliable sources.
