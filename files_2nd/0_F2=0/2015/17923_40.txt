1 Petroleum reserves continued through revisions totalled 484 MMboe, including downward Production for FY2015 totalled 256 MMboe in sales, which is revisions of 496 MMboe for our onshore unconventional operations an increase of 10 MMboe from FY2014.
There were an additional that were partially offset by additions of 12 MMboe for better than 6 MMboe in non-sales production, primarily for fuel consumed expected performance, primarily in the Shenzi field in our Gulf in our Petroleum operations.
The downward revisions in our onshore As of 30 June 2015, our proved reserves of 1,907.9 MMboe reflect unconventional operations comprised reductions related to price a net reduction of 274 MMboe and total production of 261 MMboe impact on economic productive life, deferral of development drilling including 5 MMboe in non-sales production primarily related to beyond the required five-year development window, reductions of fuel consumed in Petroleum operations compared to the previous prior estimated due to new information and other development estimate as at 30 June 2014.
Approximately 58 per cent of our program revisions and data adjustments.
The Haynesville operation proved reserves as of 30 June 2015 were in conventional operations, had the largest reductions due to price and deferral of development while approximately 42 per cent were in unconventional operations.
drilling, while the largest reduction through revisions of prior As discussed below, the decrease in proved reserves was largely estimates occurred in the Hawkville operation.
The majority driven by the very challenging commodity price environment and of the Hawkville reductions of prior estimates reflect interference a reduced capital and drilling program for the Onshore US, which between wells related to the combination of completion design has resulted in deferral of drilling into future years.
As we continue and natural reservoir fractures.
When combined with the 165 MMboe to defer development of these operations for long-term value, addition for US unconventional drilling extensions noted above, the related proved undeveloped reserves have been migrated the net effect of revisions and extensions in our US unconventional to non-proven categories within our resource base in accordance operations resulted in a net reduction of 331 MMboe.
The reductions noted above were also partially offset by the Discoveries and extensions during the year added 208 MMboe addition of 25 MMboe to proved reserves in Australia through to proved reserves, including 165 MMboe of extensions related better than expected performance primarily in the Macedon to drilling in our US shale operations, 5 MMboe of extensions field and, to a lesser extent, a number of fields in the Bass Strait related to drilling in the Atlantis field in the US Gulf of Mexico and and the North West Shelf project.

At 30June 2015, approximately four per cent of the reserves by 452 MMboe, primarily due to the very challenging price proved reserves are attributable to such arrangements.
In addition, lower commodity prices have prompted reductions in our capital program which have resulted in the deferral of development plans and transfer of proved undeveloped reserves into other non-proven categories within our resource base.
