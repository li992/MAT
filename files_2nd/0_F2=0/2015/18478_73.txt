In the year ended 31 March 2015, fees payable for such services were 82% 2014: 40% of fees payable for audit and assurance services.
All such fees are included within other operating charges.
Following a review in the year, certain costs are now separately analysed as auditrelated assurance services and costs of US$0.4m are now reported as such for the year ended 31 March 2014, having been previously reported within other assurance services.
This change aligns Experians reporting with relevant external guidance.
