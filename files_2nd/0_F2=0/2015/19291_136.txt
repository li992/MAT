Financial risk management The Groups approach to the management of financial risks together with sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments is set out below.
Treasury policy The Group holds financial instruments for two principal purposes: to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from its operations and its sources of finance.
The Group nances its operations by a mixture of cash ows from operations, short-term borrowings from banks and commercial paper markets, and longer-term loans from banks and capital markets.
The Group borrows principally in US dollars, euros and sterling, at both oating and xed rates of interest, using derivative financial instruments derivatives, where appropriate, to generate the desired currency pro le and interest rate basis.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally rate swaps, rate caps and collars, currency rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity and re nancing risk, counterparty risk and foreign currency risk.
These risks are managed by the chief financial o cer under policies approved by the board, which are summarised in this note.
All the key treasury policies remained unchanged throughout the year, except for revisions to the Groups bank counterparty risk limits and clari cations in respect of the Groups approach to compliance with laws and regulations.
The audit committee receives regular reports on the Groups treasury activities, policies and procedures.
The treasury department is not a pro t centre and its activities are subject to regular internal audit.
Liquidity and re nancing risk management The Groups objective is to secure continuity of funding at a reasonable cost.
To do this it seeks to arrange committed funding for a variety of maturities from a diversity of sources.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain the weighted average maturity of its core gross borrowings treating short-term advances as having the final maturity of the facilities available to re finance them to be between three and ten years.
At the end of 2015 the average maturity of gross borrowings was 5.1 years 2014: 4.7 years of which bonds represented 98% 2014: 97% of these borrowings.
The Group believes that ready access to di erent funding markets also helps to reduce its liquidity risk, and that published credit ratings and published financial policies improve such access.
At the year end, the long-term ratings were Baa1 from Moodys and BBB from Standard & Poors, and the short-term ratings were P2 and A2 respectively.
All of the Groups credit ratings remained unchanged during the year, although in October 2015, Standard & Poors changed the outlook on their long-term rating from Stable to Negative.
In February 2016, Moodys changed Pearsons long-term rating from Baa1 negative to Baa2 stable.
In March 2016, Standard & Poors changed Pearsons long-term rating from BBB Negative to BBB Stable.
The short-term ratings from Moodys and Standard & Poors remain unchanged at P2 and A2.
The Groups policy is to strive to maintain a rating of Baa1 BBB over the long term.
The Group also uses a range of ratios to monitor and manage its nances internally.
These include interest cover, net debt to operating pro t and cash ow to debt measures.
The Group also maintains undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At the end of 2015 the committed facilities amounted to $1,750m 1,187m and their weighted average maturity was 4.6 years.
Interest rate risk management The Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations on its borrowings is managed by borrowing on a xed rate basis and by entering into rate swaps, rate caps and forward rate agreements.
The Group also aims to avoid undue exposure to a single interest rate setting.
Re ecting this objective, the Group has predominantly swapped its xed rate bond issues to oating rate at their launch.
This creates a group of derivatives, under which the Group is a receiver of xed rates and a payer of oating rates.
The Groups policy objective has continued to be to set a target proportion of its forecast borrowings taken at the year end, with cash netted against oating rate debt and before certain adjustments for IAS 39 to be hedged i. e. xed or capped at the year end over the next four years, subject to a maximum of 65% and a minimum that starts at 40% and falls by 10% at each year end.
At the end of 2015 the xed to oating hedging ratio, on the above basis, was approximately 90%:10%.
The higher than policy ratio is a result of higher cash balances due to divestments in 2015.
Our policy is to not close out contracts where we anticipate reverting to compliance with the policy over the longer term.
A simultaneous 1% change on 1 January 2016 in the Groups variable interest rates in US dollar and sterling, taking into account forecast seasonal debt, would have a 6m e ect on pro t before tax.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk management continued The policy described above creates a further group of derivatives, under which the Group is a payer of xed rates and a receiver of oating rates.
The Groups accounting objective in relation to its use of interest rate derivatives is to minimise the impact on the income statement of changes in the mark-to-market value of its derivative portfolio as a whole.
It uses duration calculations to estimate the sensitivity of the derivatives to movements in market rates.
The Group also identi es which derivatives are eligible for fair value hedge accounting which reduces the income statement impact of changes in the market value of a derivative.
The Group then balances the total portfolio between hedge-accounted and pooled segments, so that the expected movement on the pooled segment is minimal.
Financial counterparty risk management Counterparty credit limits, which take published credit rating and other factors into account, are set to cover the Groups total aggregate exposure to a single financial institution.
The limits applicable to published credit ratings bands are approved by the chief financial o cer within guidelines approved by the board.
Exposures and limits applicable to each financial institution are reviewed on a regular basis.
Foreign currency risk management Although the Group is based in the UK, it has its most signi cant investment in overseas operations.
The most signi cant currency for the Group is the US dollar.
The Groups policy on routine transactional conversions between currencies for example, the collection of receivables, and the settlement of payables or interest remains that these should be transacted at the relevant spot exchange rate.
The majority of the Groups operations are domestic within their country of operation.
No unremitted pro ts are hedged with foreign exchange contracts, as the company judges it inappropriate to hedge non cash ow translational exposure with cash ow instruments.
However, the Group does seek to create a natural hedge of this exposure through its policy of aligning approximately the currency composition of its core net borrowings after the impact of cross-currency rate derivatives with its forecast operating pro t before depreciation and amortisation.
This policy aims to soften the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated interest cover and earnings.
The policy above applies only to currencies that account for more than 15% of Group operating pro t before depreciation and amortisation, which currently is only the US dollar.
The Group still borrows small amounts in other currencies, typically for seasonal working capital needs.
The Group policy does not require existing currency debt to be terminated to match declines in that currencys share of Group operating pro t before depreciation and amortisation.
In addition, currencies that account for less than 15% of Group operating pro t before depreciation and amortisation can be included in the above hedging process at the request of the chief financial o cer.
Included within year end net debt, the net borrowings cash in the hedging currencies above taking into account the e ect of cross-currency swaps were: US dollar 1,345m and sterling 385 m. Use of currency debt and currency derivatives The Group uses both currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to implement the above policy.
Its intention is that gains losses on the derivatives and debt o set the losses gains on the foreign currency assets and income.
Each quarter the value of hedging instruments is monitored against the assets in the relevant currency and, where practical, a decision is made whether to treat the debt or derivative as a net investment hedge permitting foreign exchange movements on it to be taken to reserves for the purposes of IAS 39.

Any cash ows based on a oating rate are calculated using interest rates as set at the date of the last rate reset.
Where this is not possible, oating rates are based on interest rates prevailing at 31 December in the relevant year.
All derivative amounts are shown gross, although the Group net settles these amounts wherever possible.
Any amounts drawn under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper are assumed to mature at the maturity date of the relevant facility, with interest calculated as payable in each calendar year up to and including the date of maturity of the facility.

Financial risk management continued Financial instruments sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2015 the sensitivity of the carrying value of the Groups financial instruments to uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates is as follows: Impact of 1% Impact of 1% Impact of 10% Impact of 10% Carrying increase in decrease in strengthening weakening in All gures in millions value interest rates interest rates in sterling sterling Investments in listed securities Investments in unlisted securities 143 4 5 Cash and cash equivalents 1,703 67 82 Marketable securities 28 Derivative financial instruments 55 93 99 14 18 Bonds 2,284 97 103 208 254 Other borrowings 46 5 6 Other net financial assets 644 57 68 Total financial instruments 133 4 4 99 123 The table shows the sensitivities of the fair values of each class of financial instruments to an isolated change in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
The class Other net financial assets comprises trade receivables less trade payables.
The sensitivities of derivative instruments are calculated using established estimation techniques such as discounted cash ow and option valuation models.
Where modelling an interest rate decrease of 1% led to negative interest rates, these points on the yield curve were adjusted to 0%.
A large proportion of the movements shown above would impact equity rather than the income statement, due to the location and functional currency of the entities in which they arise and the availability of net investment hedge treatment.
The changes in valuations are estimates of the impact of changes in market variables and are not a prediction of future events or anticipated gains or losses.
