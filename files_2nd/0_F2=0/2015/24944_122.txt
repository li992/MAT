Notes on the Financial Statements continued 19 Interests in associates and joint ventures Collateral accepted as security for assets The fair value of assets accepted as collateral in relation to reverse repo, securities borrowing and derivative margining that HSBC is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was $222,065m 2014: $269,019m.
The fair value of any such collateral sold or repledged was $139,532m 2014: $163,342m.
HSBC is obliged to return equivalent securities.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard securities borrowing, reverse repurchase agreements and derivative margining.
19 Interests in associates and joint ventures Accounting policy Investments in which HSBC, together with one or more parties, has joint control of an arrangement set up to undertake an economic activity are classified as joint ventures.
HSBC classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries Note 21 nor joint ventures, as associates.
Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method.
Under this method, such investments are initially stated at cost, including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in HSBCs share of net assets.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of interests in joint ventures and associates when the cost of investment exceeds HSBCs share of the net fair value of the associates or joint ventures identifiable assets and liabilities.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired.
Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested separately for impairment.
Profits on transactions between HSBC and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of HSBCs interest in the respective associates or joint ventures.
Losses are also eliminated to the extent of HSBCs interest in the associates or joint ventures unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Impairment of interests in associates Impairment testing involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment.
The most significant judgements relate to the impairment testing of our investment in Bank of Communications BoCom.
Key assumptions used in estimating BoComs value in use, the sensitivity of the value in use calculation to different assumptions and a sensitivity analysis that shows the changes in key assumptions that would reduce the excess of value in use over the carrying amount the headroom to nil are described below.

HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 402 Bank of Communications Co. Limited HSBCs investment in BoCom was equity accounted with effect from August 2004.
Its significant influence in BoCom was established as a result of representation on the Board of Directors and, in accordance with the Technical Cooperation and Exchange Programme, HSBC is assisting in the maintenance of financial and operating policies and a number of staff have been seconded to assist in this process.
Impairment testing At 31 December 2015, the fair value of HSBCs investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately 44 months, apart from a short period in 2013 and briefly during the first half of 2015.
As a result, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount of the investment in BoCom.
The test confirmed that there was no impairment at 31 December 2015.

Limited 17.0 15.3 9.9 15.7 14.6 13.1 Basis of recoverable amount The impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a value in use VIU calculation, with its carrying amount.
The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on managements estimates of earnings.
Cash flows beyond the shortto medium-term are then extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate.
An imputed capital maintenance charge CMC is calculated to reflect the expected regulatory capital requirements, and is calculated as a deduction from forecast cash flows.
The principal inputs to the CMC calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets, and the expected regulatory capital requirements.
Management judgement is required in estimating the future cash flows of BoCom.
Key assumptions in VIU calculation Long-term growth rate: the growth rate used was 5% 2014: 5% for periods after 2018 and does not exceed forecast GDP growth in mainland China.
Long-term asset growth rate: the growth rate used was 4% 2014: 4% for periods after 2018 and this is the rate of growth required for an assumed 5% long-term growth rate in profit.
Discount rate: the discount rate of 13% 2014: 13% is derived from a range of values obtained by applying a Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM calculation for BoCom, using market data.
Management supplements this by comparing the rates derived from the CAPM with discount rates available from external sources, and HSBCs discount rate for evaluating investments in mainland China.
The discount rate used is within the range of 10.1% to 14.2% 2014: 11.4% to 14.2% indicated by the CAPM and external sources.
Loan impairment charge as a percentage of customer advances: the ratio used ranges from 0.71% to 0.78% 2014: 0.73% to 1% in the shortto medium-term and is based on the forecasts disclosed by external analysts.
It was assumed that the long-term ratio will stabilise at a rate of 0.70% 2014: 0.65% which is slightly higher than the historical rate of 0.65%.
Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: the ratio used was 67% for all forecast periods 2014: 70% to 72% in the shortto medium-term and 70% in the long-term.
This is consistent with the forecasts disclosed by external analysts.
Cost-income ratio: the ratio used was 41% 2014: ranged from 40.0% to 42.4% in the shortto medium-term.
The ratios were consistent with the shortto medium-term range forecasts of 40.3% to 40.7% 2014: 37.2% to 44.5% disclosed by external analysts.
Sensitivity analyses were performed on each key assumption to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions.
The following change to each key assumption used on its own in the VIU calculation would reduce the headroom to nil.
