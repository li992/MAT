7 CREDITORS: AMOUNTS FALLING DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Other tax and social security 0.2 Owed to subsidiaries 382.8 578.7 Accruals and deferred income 0.7 1.2 383.5 580.1 Notes to the Company balance sheet continued 8 ANALYSIS OF BORROWINGS 130 Analysis of total borrowings 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m The borrowings are repayable as follows: Disclosed under current assets: On demand or within one year Bank borrowings net of prepaid fees 0.6 0.6 Disclosed under non-current assets: Bank borrowings net of prepaid fees 0.3 0.3 Total borrowings 0.9 During the current period the Group replaced its previous 140m committed borrowing facility, which on inception had contained a small loan element as well as an asset-backed lending facility, with a new 140m committed asset-backed lending facility which contains no loan element.
The previous facility had been due to expire in July 2016, and the new facility expires in July 2019.
Because the previous facility contained a loan element, the prepaid issue fees for that facility fell to be capitalised, set against the related borrowings, and amortised over the life of the facility.
These prepaid loan fees were disclosed in the Balance Sheet as part of borrowings, and were analysed into amounts falling due in less than and more than one year from the Balance Sheet date.
On replacement of this facility during the current period, these prepaid fees were written off.
As the new facility contains no element of a loan, the arrangement fees for the new facility fall to be treated as prepayments rather than as borrowings, and to be written back to the profit and loss account over the life of the new facility.
They are included under prepayments in the Balance Sheet, with the element due over one year from the balance sheet date being shown as a noncurrent prepayment.
At the prior period end, there were no borrowings under the facility, and so the only amounts shown under the heading of borrowings were the debit balances relating to the prepaid fees, as shown above.
As with the previous facility, the new facility is secured on the trade receivables and stock of the Group.
The carrying values of each of these classes of assets is as presented in the balance sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 140m.
There were no borrowings under any facility at either the current or previous year end.
As at 26 December 2015, the Group had available 118m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 27 December 2014: 112m, in addition to the Groups cash and short term investments as shown on the Balance Sheet.
If the Group were to use the facility, it would carry interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 125 basis points.
All borrowings are in sterling.
The Company did not incur any interest on borrowings in either period.
The directors estimate that their fair value is equal to their carrying value.
