The application of these tax rules to the Group, as a result of the Group structure, has been to defer the taxation of an amount of interest income.
It is uncertain as to whether the Group will be able to continue to defer the taxation of the interest income, and therefore the income has now been taxed and the deferred tax liability released.
Interest is now expected to be taxed on an accruals basis 11.

Impairment assessments compare the carrying value of a cash generating unit CGU to the net present value of the future cash flows it is expected to generate, discounted at a rate that management have determined reflects the specific risks relating to the business.
The Group forecasts CGU cash flows to the end of the CGUs useful life.
The pre-tax discount rate used for each reporting date was 8%.
Impairment assessments for assets other than goodwill are either considered at individual site level typically for Wind assets or segment level LFG, which are considered appropriate CGUs.
Potential impairments of goodwill are assessed against the technology on which they arose.
The split of total goodwill by technology at each reporting date was LFG 131,577,000 and wind 18,004,000.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is equal to the value of the future discounted cash flows.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Any impairment loss previously recorded in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
For all other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the CGUs carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are gas generation, wind speed, pricing of exported output and inflation.
The values assigned to the key assumptions represent managements assessment of future trends in the LFG and wind industries and were based on both external and internal sources prospective and historical data.
The key assumptions used include revenue growth of 2.5% and cost growth of 2.5% at each reporting date and reflect a weighted average of all CGUs comprising the respective operating divisions.
It has not been practicable to provide weighted average gas generation or wind speed assumptions as these are developed over a number of years with both external and internal data sources and are specific to each operating site.
The value in use modelling has been assessed for sensitivities.
With all other parameters remaining constant, a 2.0% increase in the discount rate does not give rise to a material impairment charge and in terms of either forecast sales prices or gas wind generation there is no reasonable sensitivity applied that gives rise to an impairment.

This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The full effects of these reductions have been reflected in the deferred tax figures in these financial statements.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of 841,000 because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom.

Financial instruments Capital management The Groups policies seek to match long-term assets with long-term finance and to ensure that there is sufficient working capital to meet the Groups commitments as they fall due, comply with the loan covenants and continue to sustain trading.
Management will continue to monitor actual cash flows against approved cash flow forecasts.
Financial instruments Financial instruments comprise interest rate swaps, trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from related parties, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, trade and other payables and provisions.
Financial instruments give rise to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
Information about these risks and how they are managed is set out below.
a Financial risk management measurement Financial instruments are classified into the following levels based upon the degree to which fair value is obtainable: Level 1 fair values from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 those fair values derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 those fair values derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Bond, included within interest-bearing loans, is classified as Level 1 in respect of the fair value hierarchy: the fair value is from quoted market prices.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on broker quotes and classified as Level 2.
These quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date.
All other financial instruments are measured at amortised cost and classified as Level 3.

Short-term liquidity is reviewed daily by the Treasury function, while the longer-term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board.
The Groups Treasury function is also responsible for managing the banking requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate risk, and managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts, including ensuring compliance with any banking covenants.
The Group can have significant movements in its liquidity position due to movements in electricity prices, working capital requirements and phasing of future wind development and construction projects.
The Groups policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damage to the Companys reputation.
The Group finances activities with a combination of external bank facilities, a revolving credit facility and cash from operating activities.
Based on management forecasts, the Group has adequate headroom and will continue to meet liabilities as they fall due.

Market risk interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that at least 80% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis, taking into account assets with exposure to changes in interest rates.
The Group enters into and designates interest rate swaps as hedges of the variability in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives interest rate swaps as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the year end would not affect the statement of comprehensive income.
