Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates.
The discount rate used for business valuations was 8.2% after tax 2014: 8.8%, based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
Before tax the estimated discount rate was 10.6% 2014: 12.1%.
The WACC was calculated using the market capitalisation basis as at 31 December 2015 i. e. equity valued basis.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
Values in use were determined using current year cash ows, a prudent view of future market trends and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash ow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 2%.
As at 31 December 2015, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs exceeded their net asset value.
The Directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions made in their impairment calculations that would giverise to an impairment.
