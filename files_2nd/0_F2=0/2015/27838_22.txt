COMPANY ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Advantage has been taken of the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and accordingly the Group has not presented a Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Company alone.
The net return on ordinary activities after taxation of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 27,533,467 2014: 4,462,201.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue operations for a period no less than 12 months from the reporting date.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the Directors have sought to prepare the consolidated financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The Groups presentational and functional currency is Pounds Sterling.
Pounds Sterling reflects the currency in which funds from financing activities are generated.
Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Company.
The Company controls an investee if it is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The Company reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more elements of control.
The Company controls P2PCL1 PLC the Subsidiary together the Group, a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales, through its ownership of one class A share in the Subsidiary which confers control of the voting rights in that entity.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses except for currency transaction gains or losses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Subsidiaries are valued at fair value which is deemed to be net asset value.
b Presentation of Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the guidance set out by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010.
In respect of the analysis between revenue and capital items presented within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, all expenses and finance costs, which are accounted for on an accruals basis, have been presented as revenue items except those items listed below: expenses are allocated to capital where a direct connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
Investment management fees and finance costs are allocated to capital in accordance with accounting policy 2 d : and expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment.
The following are presented as capital items: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year-end: realised and unrealised gains and losses on transactions undertaken to hedge an exposure of a capital nature: realised and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, allocated to capital in accordance with the above policies.
50 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 COMPANY ACCOUNTS c Income For financial instruments measured at amortised cost the effective interest rate EIR method is used to measure the carrying value of a financial asset or liability and to allocate associated interest income or expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
In calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, early redemption penalty charges but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees received and paid and costs borne that are an integral part of the effective interest rate and all other premiums or discounts above or below market rates.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets becomes impaired, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss and is recognised over the period to which the expected cash flows relate.
Dividend income from investments is taken to the revenue column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income on an ex-dividend basis.
Bank interest and other income receivable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The increase in the Groups share of the distributable profit in the SPV is treated as revenue return provided that the underlying assets of the SPV comprises solely of income generating loans, or investments in Platforms which themselves generate net interest income.
d Expenses, fees and commissions Fees and commissions not directly attributable to generating a financial instrument are recognised as services are provided, or on the performance of a significant act which means the Group has become contractually obligated to settle those amounts.
The Group currently charges performance fees to revenue return as it is the current expectation that the majority of the Groups return will be generated through revenue rather than capital gains on investments.
Investment management fees are allocated between the revenue and capital accounts based on the prospective split of the gross income between revenue and capital.
The percentage of management fees allocated to capital is less than 1% of the total.
Refer to Note 9 for further details of the management and performance fees.
Gains and losses arising from derivative instruments are credited or charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Gains and losses of a revenue nature are reflected in the revenue column and gains and losses of a capital nature are reflected in the capital column.
All other expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Dividends payable to Shareholders Dividends to shareholders are accounted for in the period which they are paid or approved in general meetings.
Dividends payable to shareholders are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity when they are paid, or have been approved by shareholders in the case of a final dividend and become a liability to the Group.
f Taxation The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 51 COMPANY ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
g Financial assets and financial liabilities The Group classifies its financial assets and financial liabilities at inception into the following categories: i Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss This category consists of forward foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, money market funds, unlisted equities positions, equities, fixed income securities and the investment in the SPV.
Assets and liabilities in this category are carried at fair value.
The fair values of derivative instruments are estimated using discounted cash flow models using yield curves that are based on observable market data or are based on valuations obtained from counterparties.
Investments in money market funds and the SPV are carried at fair value.
This is determined using the NAV for the units at the balance sheet date as provided by the relevant fund administrator.
The unlisted equities are valued at fair value.
The fair value is based on primary issuance of stock, secondary market transactions or third party valuations which are considered representative of the fair value.
Gains and losses arising from the changes in the fair values are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
ii Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loan assets are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans are recognised when the funds are advanced to borrowers.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provisions for impairment.
iii Purchases and sales of financial assets Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or where the assets have been transferred and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
52 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 COMPANY ACCOUNTS iv Impairment of financial assets Assets carried at amortised cost The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether, as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Evidence of impairment may include: indications that a borrower or group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty: default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or debt being restructured to reduce the burden on the borrower.
The Group assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists either individually for assets that are separately significant or individually or collectively for assets that are not separately significant.
If there is no objective evidence of impairment for an individually assessed asset it is included in a group of assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
The resultant provisions are deducted from the appropriate asset values in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the provision is adjusted and the amount of the reversal is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where a loan is not recoverable, it is written off against the related provision for loan impairment once all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are reflected against the impairment losses recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Key estimates and assumptions in impairment of financial assets The assessment of impairment of the loans and receivables at amortised cost requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions that could cause material adjustment to the carrying value of those investments.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group.
v Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
vi Derivatives Derivatives are entered into to reduce exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, market indices and credit risk and are not used for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are carried at fair value with movements in fair values recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Derivative financial instruments are valued using discounted cash flow models using yield curves that are based on observable market data or are based on valuations obtained from counterparties.
All derivatives are classified as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative.
Where there is the legal ability and intention to settle net, then the derivative is classified as a net asset or liability, as appropriate.
P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 53 COMPANY ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued vii Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
h Other receivables Other receivables do not carry any interest and are short-term in nature and are accordingly stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated impairment.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of 3 months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
j Current liabilities Current liabilities, other than derivatives, are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
k Ordinary and C Shares Ordinary and C shares are classified as equity.
The costs of issuing or acquiring equity are recognised in equity net of any related income tax benefit, as a reduction of equity on the condition that these are incremental costs directly attributable to the equity transaction that otherwise would have been avoided.
The costs of an equity transaction that is abandoned are recognised as an expense.
Those costs might include registration and other regulatory fees, amounts paid to legal, accounting and other professional advisers, printing costs and stamp duties.
The Groups equity NAV per unit is calculated by dividing the equity net assets attributable to the holder of redeemable shares divided by the total number of outstanding shares.
l Rates of exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of each transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments in foreign currencies at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on that date.
Profits or losses on exchange, together with differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets or liabilities, are taken to the capital return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on investments held at fair value are included within changes in fair value.
m Capital reserves Capital reserve arising on investments sold includes: gains losses on disposal of investments: exchange differences on currency balances and on settlement of loan balances: cost of own shares bought back: and other capital charges and credits charged to this account in accordance with the accounting policies above.
Capital reserve arising on investments held includes: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end.
All of the above are accounted for in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except the cost of own shares bought back which is accounted for in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Funds.
54 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 COMPANY ACCOUNTS n Segmental reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being the investment of the Groups capital in financial assets comprising consumer loans, small and medium sized enterprise SME loans, corporate trade receivables and or advances thereon.
o Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The Groups loans and receivables are held at amortised costs less impairments.
Loans are assessed individually for impairment based on specific evidence of an impairment having occurred, for example a borrower being a certain number of days late.
Through a review of the Groups own data as well as that reported by Platforms and other comparable public data, a percentage of principal is impaired at different stages of delinquency as a borrower becomes progressively later on their payment.
This rate varies by geography and loan type.
Recovery assumptions are made depending on any security posted against a loan, any sale agreements for loans in arrears, actual recoveries observed over time on comparable loans, or as determined by the Investment Manager and approved by the Valuation Committee.
The amount of impairment loss experienced for any given loan may ultimately differ from these assumptions.
As the Group records further data about impairment losses, the estimates applied to the impairment assessment continue to be refined and updated as applicable.
Further information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in relation to the impairment of loans are described in Note 8.
Estimates and assumptions made in the valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of those assets and liabilities.
These are valued in accordance with the techniques set out in Note 2 g. p New standards and amendments to existing standards Accounting standards issued but not yet effective At the date of this document, the following applicable standards were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers, effective 1 January 2018.
This is the converged standard on revenue recognition and replaces IAS 11, Construction contracts, IAS 18, Revenue and related interpretations.
IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations, effective 1 January 2016.
The amendments to IFRS 11 clarify the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation where the activities of the operation constitute a business.
They require an investor to apply the principles of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business.
IAS 16 and IAS 38, Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation, effective 1 January 2016.
The amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 clarify that a revenue-based method of depreciation or amortisation is generally not appropriate.
IAS 27, Equity method in separate financial statements, effective 1 January 2016.
The amendments to IAS 27 allow entities to use the equity method in their separate financial statements to measure investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 55 COMPANY ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued IFRS 10 and IAS 28, Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture, effective 1 January 2016.
The amendments clarify the accounting treatment for sales or contribution of assets between an investor and its associates or joint ventures.
They confirm that the accounting treatment depends on whether the non-monetary assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
IAS 1, Disclosure Initiative, effective 1 January 2016.
The amendments to IAS 1 provide clarifications on a number of issues including: materiality an entity should not aggregate or disaggregate information in a manner that obscures useful information, disaggregation and subtotals line items specified in IAS 1 may need to be disaggregated where this is relevant to an understanding of the entitys financial position of performance, notes notes do not need to be presented in a particular order, and OCI arising from investments accounted for under the equity method.
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28, Investment entities: Applying the consolidation exception, effective 1 January 2016.
These amendments clarify that the exception from preparing consolidated financial statements is also available to intermediate parent entities which are subsidiaries of investment entities, an investment entity should consolidate a subsidiary which is not an investment entity and whose main purpose and activity is to provide services in support of the investment entitys investment activities, and entities which are not investment entities but have an interest in an associate or joint venture which is an investment entity have a policy choice when applying the equity method of accounting.
The fair value measurement applied by the investment entity associate or joint venture can either be retained, or a consolidation may be performed at the level of the associate or joint venture, which would then unwind the fair value measurement.
These new standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements or performance.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments, specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets and liabilities, including some hybrid contracts.
The standard improves and simplifies the approach for classification and measurement of financial assets compared with the requirements of IAS 39.
Most of the requirements in IAS 39 for classification and measurement of financial liabilities were carried forward unchanged.
The standard applies a consistent approach to classifying financial assets and replaces the numerous categories of financial assets in IAS 39, each of which had its own classification criteria.
IFRS 9 now divides all financial assets that are under the scope of IAS 39 into two classifications those measured at amortised cost and those measured at fair value.
The determination is made at initial recognition.
Specifically, under IFRS 9 loans and receivables can be measured at amortised cost only if the objective of the entity is to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows and that the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding.
All other debt instruments will be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Also, IFRS 9 requires expected credit losses to be recognised in contrast to IAS 39 which only recognises incurred credit losses.
The Directors are currently evaluating the impact of this standard upon the Group.
56 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 COMPANY ACCOUNTS 3.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following fair value hierarchy levels based on the significance of the inputs used in measuring its fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Level 3 Pricing inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
An investment is always categorised as Level 1, 2 or 3 in its entirety.
In certain cases, the fair value measurement for an investment may use a number of different inputs that fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In such cases, an investments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgement and is specific to the investment.

DERIVATIVES Typically, derivative contracts serve as components of the Groups investment strategy and are utilised primarily to structure and hedge investments to enhance performance and reduce risk to the Group the Group does not currently designate any derivatives as hedges for hedge accounting purposes as described under IAS 39.
Derivative instruments may also be used for trading purposes where the Investment Manager believes this would be more effective than investing directly in the underlying financial instruments.
The derivative contracts that the Group currently holds are forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts.
The Group records its derivative activities on a fair value basis.
See Note 2 g vi for valuation of financial instruments.
Forward contracts Forward contracts entered into by the Group represent a firm commitment to buy or sell an underlying asset, or currency at a specified value and point in time based upon an agreed or contracted quantity.
The realised unrealised gain or loss is equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the onset and the value of the contract at settlement date year end date and is included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
As of 31 December 2015, the following forward foreign exchange contracts were included in the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value through profit or loss: Assets Purchase Purchase Sale Sale Fair Value Settlement date currency amount currency amount 4 January 2016 USD 34,700,000 GBP 23,377,393 165,588 165,588 Liabilities Purchase Purchase Sale Sale Fair Value Settlement date currency amount currency amount 3 March 2016 GBP 642,774 EUR 910,000 28,809 3 March 2016 GBP 8,509,705 NZD 19,332,000 437,362 3 March 2016 GBP 12,568,459 NZD 28,468,000 606,854 3 March 2016 GBP 296,464,013 USD 446,400,000 6,376,528 3 March 2016 GBP 202,632,097 USD 304,600,000 4,010,441 3 March 2016 GBP 550,535 AUD 1,140,000 10,537 11,470,531 Forward contracts continued 64 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 COMPANY ACCOUNTS As of 31 December 2014, the following forward foreign exchange contracts were included in the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value through profit or loss: Assets Purchase Purchase Sale Sale Fair Value Settlement date currency amount currency amount 4 March 2015 GBP 714,779 EUR 900,000 15,634 4 March 2015 GBP 296,776 AUD 550,000 9,198 24,832 Liabilities Purchase Purchase Sale Sale Fair Value Settlement date currency amount currency amount 4 March 2015 GBP 114,000,690 USD 178,500,000 530,114 530,114 All forward contracts held by the Group are held at the Company level, therefore no separate tables are presented for the Company.
Option contracts The option contracts presented in the tables in Note 3 are interest rate caps entered into by the Group.
An interest rate cap is an interest rate agreement in which the seller agrees to compensate the buyer for the amount by which the reference rate exceeds a specified rate on a series of dates during the life of the contract.
Offsetting The Group may be eligible to present net on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, certain financial assets and financial liabilities according to criteria described in Note 2 g vii.
At 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, none of the financial assets and financial liabilities met the eligibility criteria and therefore none were presented net on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Accordingly the amounts disclosed in the following tables as Net amounts of recognised assets presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are the same as the gross amounts.
The following tables provide information on the financial impact of netting for instruments subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
The columns related amounts not eligible to be set-off in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position disclose the amounts with respect to derivative financial instruments which are subject to master netting arrangements but were not offset due to not meeting the net settlement simultaneous settlement criteria or because the rights to set-off are conditional upon the default of the counterparty only.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS Introduction Risk is inherent in the Groups activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
The Group is exposed to market risk which includes currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arising from the financial instruments held by the Group.
Risk management structure The Directors are ultimately responsible for identifying and controlling risks.
Day to day management of the risk arising from the financial instruments held by the Group has been delegated to MW Eaglewood Europe LLP as Investment Manager and AIFM to the Group.
The Investment Manager has delegated certain of its responsibilities and functions, including its discretionary management of the Groups portfolio of Credit Assets, to the Sub-Manager.
The Group has no employees and the Directors have all been appointed on a non-executive basis.
Whilst the Group has taken all reasonable steps to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable it to comply with its obligations, the Group is reliant upon the performance of third party service providers for its executive function.
In particular, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Manager, the Depositary, the Administrator, the Loan Administrator and the Registrar are performing services which are integral to the operation of the Group.
Failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the Group in accordance with the terms of its appointment could have a materially detrimental impact on the operation of the Group.
The principal risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Groups performance have not changed from those set out in detail on pages 18-38 of the Companys Prospectus dated 30 June 2015, available on the Groups website, www.
Namely: i There can be no guarantee that the investment objective will be achieved or that the portfolio of investments will generate the rates of return expected.
There is no guarantee that any dividends will be paid in respect of any financial year or period.
ii The Group has no employees and is reliant on the performance of third party service providers.
iii The Group is reliant on the effective operation of the Investment Managers and the Sub-Managers IT systems for the loan acquisition process.
Any IT systems failure could have a material adverse effect on the ability to acquire and realise investments.
iv The Group may borrow money for investment purposes, which exposes the Group to risks associated with borrowings.
68 P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 COMPANY ACCOUNTS v Loans acquired through Platforms are subject to risks of borrower default.
The default history for loans is limited and actual defaults may be greater than indicated by historical data.
Platforms means origination platforms that allow non-bank capital to engage with and: lend to consumer or SME borrowers: advance capital against corporate trade receivables: and or purchase trade receivables from sellers: together with any other origination platforms agreed between the Company and the Investment Manager.
vi The P2P industry in the UK faced increased regulation from 1 April 2014.
These and any future regulatory changes may result in interruptions in operations, increased costs and reduced returns to the Group.
vii The Group, in common with other Platform lender members, may be exposed to the following risks relating to compliance and regulation of the Platforms and the Company in the United States: Federal and state regulators could subject the Platforms and their lender members, such as the Company, to legal and regulatory examination or enforcement action.
Non-compliance with laws and regulations may impair the Platforms ability to arrange or service borrower member loans, which could impact the Companys ability to purchase loans or Notes or receive payments on the loans or Notes it has already purchased.
Potential characterisation of loan marketers and other originators as lenders may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
viii Any change in the Groups tax status or in taxation legislation or practice generally could adversely affect the value of the investments held by the Group, or the Groups ability to provide returns to Shareholders, or alter the post-tax returns to Shareholders.
ix The value of the ordinary and C shares and the income derived from those shares if any can fluctuate and may go down as well as up.
The ordinary and C shares may trade at a discount to NAV.
x It may be difficult for Shareholders to realise their investment and there may not be a liquid market in the ordinary shares.
xi If the Directors decide to issue C shares or further ordinary shares, the proportions of the voting rights held by Shareholders may be diluted.
xii Dividend payments on the ordinary and C shares are not guaranteed.
xiii Changes in tax law may reduce any return for investors in the Group.
The risks faced by the Group have not changed significantly since the commencement of operations and are not expected to change materially in the next 12 months.
The investment objective and operating environment of the Subsidiary is consistent with that of the Company.
Therefore the above risks and uncertainties are applicable to both the Company and the Group.
In seeking to implement the investment objectives of the Group while limiting risk, the Group is subject to the investment limits restrictions set out in the Credit Risk section of this note.
P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 69 COMPANY ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 6.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued Market risk incorporating price, currency and interest rate risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in observable market variables such as foreign exchange rates, equity prices and interest rates.
The Group is exposed to market risk primarily through its Financial Instruments.
The Investment Manager regularly reviews the investment portfolio and industry developments to ensure that any events which may impact the Group are identified and considered.
This also ensures that any risks affecting the investment portfolio are identified and mitigated to the fullest extent possible.
Market price risk The Group is exposed to price risk arising from the investments held by the Group for which prices in the future are uncertain.
The investment in the SPV, investment in money market funds, unlisted equities and equities are exposed to market price risk.
Refer to Note 3 for further details on the sensitivity of the Groups Level 3 investments to price risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments.
The Group is exposed to risks associated with the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates on its financial position and cash flows.
Loans held by the Group at amortised cost, with a fixed interest rate, are not exposed to interest rate changes.
Fixed income securities with fixed interest rates are exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had 0.21% 2014: Nil of the total assets classified as bonds with a fixed interest rate.
Financial Instruments with a floating interest rate that resets as market rates change are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had 7.33% 2014: 8.54% of the total assets classified as cash and cash equivalents and 4.42% of fixed income securities with floating interest rates.
At 31 December 2015, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1% with all other variables held constant, the change in the value of future expected interest cash flows of these assets would have been 1,142,755 2014: 171,965.
1% is considered to be a reasonably possible movement in interest rates.
The Group has, through the Subsidiary, entered into a revolving bank credit facility which is subject to a variable interest rate.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had 85,000,000 drawn down under the facility.
The Group does not intend to hedge interest rate risk on a regular basis.
however, where it enters floating-rate liabilities against fixed-rate loans, it may at its sole discretion seek to hedge out the interest rate exposure, taking into consideration amongst other things the cost of hedging and the general interest rate environment.
Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of net assets will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Relevant risk variables are generally movements in the exchange rates of non-functional currencies in which the Group holds financial assets and liabilities.
The assets of the Group are invested in Credit Assets which are denominated in US Dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling and other currencies.
Accordingly, the value of such assets may be affected favourably or unfavourably by fluctuations in currency rates.
The Group hedges currency exposure between Pounds Sterling and any other currency in which the Groups assets may be denominated, in particular US Dollars and Euros.
Concentration of foreign currency exposure The Investment Manager monitors the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and may use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency exposure of the Groups non GBP denominated investments.
The Investment Manager re-examines the currency exposure on a regular basis in each currency and manages the Groups currency exposure in accordance with market expectations.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS continued The Groups credit risks arise principally through exposures to loans acquired by the Group, which are subject to risk of borrower default.
The ability of the Group to earn revenue is completely dependent upon payments being made by the borrower of the loan acquired by the Group through a Platform.
The Group as a lender member will receive payments under any loans it acquires through a Platform only if the corresponding borrower through that Platform borrower member makes payments on the loan.
Consumer loans are typically unsecured obligations of borrowers.
They are not secured by any collateral, not guaranteed or insured by any third party and not backed by any governmental authority in any way.
SME Loans are typically not secured against collateral but are backed by personal guarantees of the business director s. Real estate loans are secured against collateral.
Depending on specific circumstances, the Platforms and their designated third party collection agencies may be limited in their ability to collect on loans.
The Group must rely on the collection efforts of the Platforms and their designated collection agencies and has no direct recourse against borrower members.
The Group will invest across various Platforms, asset classes, geographies primarily United States and Europe and credit bands in order to ensure diversification and to seek to mitigate concentration risks.
The credit quality of loans is assessed through evaluation of various factors, including credit scores, payment data and other information.

TAXATION Investment trust status It is the intention of the Directors to conduct the affairs of the Company so as to satisfy the conditions for approval as an investment trust.
As at 31 December 2015, the Company does not hold more than 15% of its investments in any single company.
As an investment trust the Company is exempt from corporation tax on capital gains.
The Companys revenue income from loans is taxable in the hands of the Companys shareholders and likewise is not subject to corporation tax.
Any change in the Companys tax status or in taxation legislation generally could affect the value of the investments held by the Group, affect the Companys ability to provide returns to shareholders, lead the Company to lose its exemption from UK corporation tax on chargeable gains or alter the post-tax returns to shareholders.
It is not possible to guarantee that the Company will remain a non-close company, which is a requirement to maintain status as an investment trust, as the ordinary or C shares are freely transferable.
The Company, in the unlikely event that it becomes aware that it is a close company, or otherwise fails to meet the criteria for maintaining investment trust status, will, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify shareholders of this fact.
The tax charge for the year differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 21.49%.
The differences are explained below: 2015 Revenue Capital Total Net return on ordinary activities before taxation Tax at the standard UK corporation tax rate of 21.49% Effects of: Capital items exempt from corporation tax Non-taxable income Total tax charge P2P GLOBAL INVESTMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 77 COMPANY ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11.
