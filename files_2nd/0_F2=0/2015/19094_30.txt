Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of trade and assets, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
The amounts are capitalised and written off on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life, which is five years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value at the date of acquisition.
Where this can be measured reliably after initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All of the Companys intangible assets have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer lists 3 years For accounting purposes, customer lists have been identified separately.
Customer lists allow the Company to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Company Financial Statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the awards made is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Subsidiaries are recharged for the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees.
The fair value of the recharge is recognised over the vesting period.
Dividends Dividends receivable are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Share-based payments The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements in note 18.
