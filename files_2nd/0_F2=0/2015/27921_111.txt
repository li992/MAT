CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Over recent years, in common with other financial services firms, the Group has followed guidance issued by the FCA in respect of redress to customers in respect of the misselling of payment protection insurance PPI, though the sums involved have not been material.
In November 2014 the UK Supreme Court handed down its decision in Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited Plevin, which addressed potential liability in respect of PPI claims under section 140 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, where commission charged to the customer was particularly high.
On 2 October 2015 the FCA published a statement outlining proposed rules addressing the handling of PPI cases in the light of the Plevin decision and including a deadline beyond which no further new PPI claims would be required to be considered.
The Group has reviewed its current exposure to PPI claims in the light of the Courts judgement in Plevin and the FCA proposals and its current expectation is that it will suffer no material additional costs from PPI claims.
However, this assessment is based on our current interpretation of both the Plevin judgement and the draft rules, which may be revised before finalisation, while interpretations may develop as both the judgement and the rules are implemented.
Therefore it is possible that the maximum possible liability may be greater, but it is impracticable to evaluate the potential impact at this stage.
