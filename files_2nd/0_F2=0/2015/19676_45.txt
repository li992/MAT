The address of the registered office is given on the back cover.
The Groups operations and its principal activities are set out earlier in this Report at pages 1 to 13.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.
1.2 Basis of preparation Statement of compliance The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 19 May 2015.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and its interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.
Further details of the Groups liquidity position and going concern review are provided in note 32 of the Financial Statements on pages 177 and 178.
Basis of measurement The financial statements of the Group and the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and assets of the Group pension schemes which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view.
The financial statements of the Group and Company are presented in pounds sterling.
Operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling are included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Groups foreign currencies accounting policy.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at pages 126 to 127.

2.1 New standards, amendments and interpretations which are effective in financial year ended March 2015 i IFRIC 21 The Group has adopted IFRIC 21: Levies in the current financial year.
The interpretation clarifies that an entity should recognise liabilities for qualifying levies on the occurrence of an activity that triggers an obligation to the relevant authority.
Qualifying levies fall within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets but not within the scope of IAS 12 Income taxes or other standards.
The adoption of the interpretation has had no impact on the Groups accounting policies or on the results of the Group for the financial year ending 31 March 2015.
The interpretation will be applied by the Group in relation to its mandated funding, as a licenced energy supplier, of the Contracts for Difference CfDs scheme introduced by the UK Government on 1 April 2015. ii IFRS 10, 11 and 12 IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements, IFRS 11: Joint arrangements, IFRS 12: Disclosures of interests in other entities, and revisions to IAS 27: Separate financial statements and IAS 28: Investments in associates and joint ventures have been adopted by the Group in the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
The most significant impact for the Group relates to the adoption of IFRS 11.
Under this standard, the Group has assessed its joint arrangements in order to identify those which require to be classified as joint operations rather than joint ventures.
Joint operations arise where the venturers are deemed to have joint control and have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement as opposed to having rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Accordingly, a joint operator will recognise its share of the operations assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements rather than its net share of the result of the venture.
The Group has assessed that its investment in Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited falls within this category under the standard but that all other joint arrangements held by the Group are classified as joint ventures, which will continue to be equity accounted.
This has resulted in the restatement of the Groups Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Cash Flow Statements for the year to 31 March 2014.
These restatements are summarised below.
It should be noted that as the Group currently reports its adjusted profit measures including its respective shares of operating profit, interest and tax of the affected investments, no change arises in respect of the measures reported internally and in the Annual Report in respect of underlying performance.

These amendments included amended disclosures and requirements in relation to IAS 32, IAS 36 and IAS 39.
There was no material impact on the Groups financial statements arising from the adoption of these amendments.
2.2 Effective in financial year ended 31 March 2016 and in future At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year ended 31 March 2015, that have had a material impact on the Group.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is effective on 1 January 2017 at the earliest subject to European Union EU endorsement: the amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations which are effective on 1 January 2016, subject to EU endorsement: IFRS 9: Financial instruments which will be effective on 1 January 2018, subject to EU endorsement, and, a number of disclosure and requirement changes including recommendations from the IASBs Annual Improvement Projects.
The Group has not fully assessed the impact of adopting IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and it is not practicable to provide an quantified assessment of the effect of these standards in these financial statements.
The Group will provide this impact assessment in future financial statements.
1 Establishment of Enterprise segment Following changes to the structure of the Groups internal organisation, and subsequent changes to the way in which financial and management information is presented to both the Board and the Executive Committee, the composition of the Groups Reportable Segments changed in the financial year ended 31 March 2015.
The change to the Groups organisation structure was the establishment of the Enterprise business in order to bring together a number of activities under single leadership.
The change allows the energy and related needs of the Groups industrial and commercial customers in competitive markets to be better met through an integrated approach.
The services being provided to these customers include electrical contracting, private energy networks, lighting services and telecoms capacity and bandwidth.
As a result of this change, activities previously reported under Other Networks have been combined with electrical contracting, previously reported under Energy-related Services, to derive the reported revenue and operating profit of the Enterprise segment.
As these are customer-facing businesses in competitive markets, these results are reported as part of the Retail business.
In the year to 31 March 2014, this Enterprise segment delivered adjusted operating profit of 56.8m.
The remaining part of the Energy-Related Services segment metering, home services and other products, which will also continue to be reported separately under Retail, delivered adjusted operating profit of 24.1m in the year to 31 March 2014.
The changes to reported segments can be summarised as follows: The Revenue by segment disclosure note for the year to March 2014 has been amended as follows: i Revenue by segment Year ended 31 March 2014 As Reported Adjustment Restated Total Revenue m m m Networks Other networks 346.1 346.1 Retail Enterprise 594.7 594.7 Energy-related Services 467.1 248.6 218.5 467.1 346.1 813.2 Other segments unchanged 35,226.

Change in measurement basis The Group announced in March 2014 that it intended to reorganise its activities so that there are separately auditable legal entities responsible for its Energy Supply, Energy Portfolio Management EPM and Electricity Generation activities.
This change is being made in order to enhance the transparency of the measurement and reporting of the performance of these activities.
As a result of the changes announced and subsequently implemented, the Groups basis of inter-segmental pricing and consequential internal reporting has been changed in the year to 31 March 2015.
The revised methodology ensures greater market reflectivity, closer alignment with the operational decision-making in the respective businesses and has also been informed by the Groups engagement with the Competition and Markets Authority during the financial year.
The Group will provide comprehensive detail on the basis of the composition of the Great Britain components of these segments in its Consolidated Segmental Statement CSS, an audited mandatory regulatory document produced in accordance with Standard Licence Condition 16B of Electricity Generation Licences and Standard Licence Condition 19A of the Electricity and Gas Supply Licences.
The CSS will be published by 31 July 2015.
The activities conducted in EPM and Electricity Generation will continue to be reported to the Board as a single reportable operating segment.
