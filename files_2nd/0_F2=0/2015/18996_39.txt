Costs in respect of this restructuring were incurred in both the current and prior period.
The prior period exceptional charge of 50.6 million included an amount of 29.6 million in respect of the impairment of non-core properties.
Impairment of freehold and leasehold properties At 1 February 2015 the Groups freehold and leasehold properties were revalued by independent chartered surveyors on an open market value basis.
The resulting revaluation adjustments have been recognised in the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
The amount recognised in the income statement comprises: 2015 m Impairment of other intangible assets note 11 0.1 Reversal of impairment of other intangible assets note 11 0.2 Impairment of property, plant and equipment note 12 60.1 Reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment note 12 26.3 Impairment of assets held for sale note 15 5.0 Reversal of impairment of assets held for sale note 15 0.1 Valuation fees 0.4 39.0 Impact of change in rate assumptions used for onerous lease provisions Due to significant movements in gilt yields and ination rates in the current period, the update of the discount and ination rate assumptions used in the calculation of the Groups onerous property lease provisions at the current period end resulted in an increase of 4.9 million in the total provision.
84 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 4 NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS CONTINUED Relocation, reorganisation and integration costs During the current period redevelopment of the Groups head ofce building in Wolverhampton commenced along with a reorganisation of certain head ofce functions.
Costs of 1.6 million were incurred in respect of temporarily relocating to alternative premises nearby during the period of redevelopment and in undertaking the reorganisation.
The Group also incurred reorganisation and integration costs of 1.0 million as a result of the acquisition of the trading operations of Daniel Thwaites PLCs beer division.
Portfolio disposal of pubs During the prior period the Group disposed of a portfolio of 202 pubs and subsequently entered into a four year lease and five year management agreement in respect thereof.
The loss on disposal was 35.8 million and revaluation surpluses of 37.5 million were transferred from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings upon disposal, giving a net impact of 1.7 million.
The Group no longer has strategic control of these pubs and they do not form part of its core activities.
As such the results in respect of the ongoing operation and management of these pubs post disposal have been classied as a non-underlying item, comprised as follows: 2015 2014 m m Revenue 33.1 27.7 Operating expenses 35.7 29.6 2.6 1.9 Movement in fair value of interest rate swaps The Groups interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of interest rate swaps which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, and the ineffective portion of the movement in fair value of interest rate swaps which are accounted for as hedging instruments are both recognised in the income statement.
The net loss of 8.6 million 2014: 8.2 million is shown as an exceptional item.
Impact of taxation The current tax credit relating to the above non-underlying items amounts to 1.9 million 2014: 13.0 million.
The deferred tax credit relating to the above non-underlying items amounts to 7.8 million 2014: 11.8 million.
Prior period non-underlying items A review of the Groups property leases in the prior period indicated that an additional provision of 28.0 million was required for leases which were considered to be onerous, along with an associated impairment of leasehold properties of 1.5 million.
This was primarily due to the reversion of a number of leases to the Group in the prior period and a deterioration in market conditions.
During the prior period the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to future accrual.
The net credit of 10.8 million comprised the negative past service cost of 11.2 million less associated costs of 0.4 million.
In previous periods the Group received refunds totalling 5.9 million from HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
This followed Tribunal Court of Appeal hearings involving The Rank Group Plc Rank, which concluded that there had been a breach of scal neutrality in the treatment of gaming machine income as liable to UK VAT.
HMRC issued protective assessments to recover the repayments pending the result of further Court hearings.
On 30 October 2013 the Court of Appeal found in favour of HMRC and the Group subsequently repaid the refunds of 5.9 million plus interest of 0.3 million thereon.
In the period ended 5 October 2013 the Group had recognised a provision for the 5.9 million repayment and interest of 0.5 million.
As such there was a reduction in the interest accrual of 0.2 million in the prior period.
During the prior period the Group repurchased all of its securitised AB1 notes at par.
The notes, with a nominal value of 80.0 million, were immediately cancelled and the associated oating-to-xed interest rate swap held in respect of this tranche of securitised debt was terminated.
This swap had been designated as a cash ow hedge of the forecast oating rate interest payments arising in respect of the AB1 notes.
As these forecast transactions were no longer expected to occur the cumulative hedging loss of 24.7 million was recognised in the income statement.
