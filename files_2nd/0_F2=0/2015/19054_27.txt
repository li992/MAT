Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 1.1 Basis of preparation Merlin Entertainments plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and its registered office is 3 Market Close, Poole, Dorset, BH15 1NQ.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The accounting policies set out in the sections below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2014: 52 weeks ended 27 December 2014.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are measured at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling.
All values are stated in million m except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern The Group reported a profit for the year of 170 million 2014: 162 million and generated operating cash inflows of 325 million 2014: 357 million.
Following a refinancing in March 2015, extending maturities and diversifying the Groups sources of funding, the Group is now funded by bank facilities due for repayment in 2020 and fixed rate notes due for repayment in 2022.
The Group has access to a 300 million revolving credit facility to support its liquidity needs of which nil was drawn down at the year end.
The Groups forecasts show that it is expected to be able to operate within the terms of these facilities.
Further details of these facilities are provided in note 4.2.
After reviewing the Groups statement of financial position, available facilities, cash flow forecasts and trading budgets and making appropriate enquiries, the Directors believe the Group to be operationally and financially robust and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next twelve months.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Merlin Entertainments plc, its subsidiaries and branches at the end of each reporting period and include its share of its joint ventures results using the equity method.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
Where subsidiaries enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, these are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the subsidiary concerned treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that it will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
113 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 1.1 Basis of preparation continued Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of those Group companies that do not have a Sterling functional currency are translated into Sterling as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period.
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity in the translation reserve.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments often consist of a combination of debt and equity and the Group has to decide how to attribute values to each.
They are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Groups own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Groups own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability, and where such an instrument takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
In this regard the impairment testing note 3.3 involves a higher degree of judgement or complexity and is explained in more detail in the related note.
New standards and interpretations A full list of new accounting standards and interpretations that have been implemented in the year or will be implemented next year, and which have no significant impact, can be found in note 5.5.
114 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2.1 Profit before tax Segmental information An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses.
The Group is managed through its three Operating Groups, which form the operating segments on which the information shown below is prepared.
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer CEO, who is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
An operating segments results are reviewed regularly by the CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Performance is measured based on segment EBITDA, as included in internal management reports.
Segment operating profit is included below for information purposes.

There has been no change to the operating segments or their composition.
This change does not affect the 2014 figures.
The effect has been to increase the 2015 reported segment EBITDA and operating profit in Midway Attractions, LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks by 4 million, 1 million and 2 million respectively, with an equivalent increase in costs of 7 million reported within Other items in the tables above.
2 Other items include Mer lin Magic Making, head office costs and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable segments.
115 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2.1 Profit before tax continued Geographical areas While each Operating Group is managed on a worldwide basis, part of our strategy is to diversify geographically across the four regions shown below.
The information presented is based on the geographical locations of the visitor attractions concerned.
Geographical information Non-current Non-current Revenues assets Revenues assets 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m United Kingdom 467 851 490 811 Continental Europe 300 764 318 794 North America 336 481 274 429 Asia Pacific 175 333 167 325 1,278 2,429 1,249 2,359 Deferred tax 35 49 Investments 11 6 2,475 2,414 Revenue Accounting policy Revenue arises from the operation of visitor attractions and theme park resorts.
Revenue represents the amounts excluding VAT and similar taxes received from customers for admissions tickets, accommodation revenue, retail, food and beverage sales and sponsorship.
Revenue from the sale of annual passes is deferred and then recognised over the period that the pass is valid.
Ticket revenue is recognised at point of entry.
From time to time, the Group enters into service contracts for attraction development and revenue is recognised under these contracts on a percentage completion basis.
Service contract revenue in the current and previous years is not material.
Cost of sales Cost of sales of 193 million 2014: 181 million represents variable expenses excluding VAT and similar taxes incurred from revenue generating activity.
Retail inventory and food and beverage consumables are the principal expenses included under this category.
116 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2.1 Profit before tax continued Operating expenses Staff numbers and costs The average number of persons employed by the Group including Directors during the year, analysed by category, was as follows: 2015 2014 Operations 16,980 15,567 Attraction management and central administration 1,841 1,760 18,821 17,327 The aggregate payroll costs of these persons were as follows: 2015 2014 m m Wages and salaries 279 266 Share-based payments note 4.6 4 4 Social security costs 34 32 Other pension costs 10 10 327 312 Auditors remuneration 2015 2014 m m Audit of these financial statements 1.2 1.2 Audit of financial statements of subsidiaries 0.3 0.3 Other assurance services 0.4 0.4 Other services relating to taxation 0.4 0.4 2.3 2.3 117 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2.2 Exceptional items Accounting policy Due to their nature, certain one-off and non-trading items have been classified separately as exceptional items in order to draw them to the attention of the reader.
In the judgement of the Directors this presentation shows the underlying performance of the Group more accurately.
Exceptional items The following items are exceptional and have been shown separately on the face of the consolidated income statement: 2015 2014 m m Within finance income and costs 1 Foreign exchange gain 1 - 1 Cash flow hedges - reclassified to profit and loss 14 - 2 Loss on re-measurement of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost - 23 Exceptional items before income tax 13 23 Income tax credit on exceptional items above 3 6 Exceptional items for the year 10 17 1 As part of the refinancing undertaken during the year see note 4.2, the Group incurred net exceptional financing costs of 13 million.
The Group restructured its interest rate swaps as part of a wider refinancing of the debt facilities, and paid a net 13 million to cash settle certain swaps.
In respect of these swaps, 14 million had previously been hedge accounted through equity and was therefore recycled through the income statement.
This was then offset by foreign exchange gains of 1 million as part of the wider refinancing.
These have been separately presented in order to better present the underlying finance cost for the Group.
Further details of the Groups borrowings are presented in note 4.2.
2 The Group determined at 27 December 2014 that a more reliable estimate could be formed of the likelihood and timeframe for an earlier refinancing of its existing bank facilities than the contractual repayment date of July 2019.
This was determined following reviews undertaken by management and external advisors of refinancing options.
As a result the Group accelerated the amortisation of financing costs and the resulting adjustment was recognised as a loss on re-measurement and separately presented in the income statement as an exceptional charge as it was not part of the Groups underlying finance cost.
2.3 Finance income and costs Accounting policies Income and costs Finance income comprises interest income, applicable foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets taking a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use as part of the cost of that asset.

119 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2.4 Taxation Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.

The difference between the reported ETR of 28.1% and the UK standard weighted tax rate of 20.3% is mainly due to the different tax rates that apply in the various jurisdictions the Group operates in around the world.
The ETR based on underlying trading, excluding exceptional items, was 27.9% in 2015 2014: 28.0%.

The tax losses arose in jurisdictions which are not expected to generate taxable profits in the foreseeable future and therefore there is currently no expectation that the losses will be utilised.
123 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 2.5 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders is adjusted for exceptional items see note 2.2.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: 2015 2014 m m Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 170 162 Exceptional items net of tax see note 2.2 10 17 Adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 180 179 2015 2014 Basic weighted average number of shares 1,013,746,032 1,013,746,032 Dilutive potential ordinary shares 1,720,789 434,077 Diluted weighted average number of shares 1,015,466,821 1,014,180,109 Share incentive plans see note 4.6 are treated as dilutive to earnings per share when, at the reporting date, the awards are both in the money and would be issuable had the performance period ended at that date.
In 2015, the PSP has a dilutive effect as the performance measures have been partially achieved, whereas the DBP, CSOP and AESP are dilutive as certain option tranches are in the money, after accounting for the value of services rendered in addition to the option price.
In 2014 the PSP had a dilutive effect as the performance measures had been partially achieved, whereas the DBP was not dilutive as the awards had not yet been issued, and the CSOP was not dilutive as the options were out of the money after accounting for the value of services rendered in addition to the option price.

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately.
The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs primarily staff expenses and capitalised borrowing costs.
Assets acquired through business combinations At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued.
Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a depreciated replacement cost basis.
The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost: and depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset.
The total estimated lives applied are consistent with those set out below.
Residual values are based on industry specific indices.
New sites Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction.
Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition.
Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.
On inception of a lease for a new site, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within PPE and depreciated over the lease term.
A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 3.5.
Existing sites Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories: Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the operational life of, or enhances existing items of PPE is accounted for as an addition to PPE.
Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our attractions to visitors.
Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income statement as incurred.
Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items of PPE.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as appropriate.
No residual values are typically considered.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold long leasehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 20 - 50 years Plant and equipment 5 - 30 years 125 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued Property, plant and equipment Land and Plant and Under buildings equipment construction Total m m m m Cost Balance at 29 December 2013 862 861 62 1,785 Additions 29 46 123 198 Movements in asset retirement provisions 3 2 - 5 Disposals 1 3 - 4 Transfers 37 57 94 - Effect of movements in foreign exchange 11 9 - 20 Balance at 27 December 2014 919 954 91 1,964 Additions 25 42 151 218 Movements in asset retirement provisions note 3.5 3 - - 3 Disposals 6 10 - 16 Transfers 53 88 141 - Effect of movements in foreign exchange 17 16 1 34 Balance at 26 December 2015 977 1,058 100 2,135 Depreciation Balance at 29 December 2013 161 303 - 464 Depreciation for the year - owned assets 26 69 - 95 Depreciation for the year - leased assets 1 3 - 4 Disposals 1 3 - 4 Effect of movements in foreign exchange - 5 - 5 Balance at 27 December 2014 187 367 - 554 Depreciation for year - owned assets 28 78 - 106 Depreciation for year - leased assets 1 3 - 4 Disposals 6 10 - 16 Effect of movements in foreign exchange - 8 - 8 Balance at 26 December 2015 210 430 - 640 Carrying amounts At 29 December 2013 701 558 62 1,321 At 27 December 2014 732 587 91 1,410 At 26 December 2015 767 628 100 1,495 126 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued PPE was tested for impairment in accordance with the Groups accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3.
No impairment charges have been made in the current or prior year.
The Group leases buildings and plant and equipment under finance lease agreements secured on those assets.
At 26 December 2015 the net carrying amount of leased buildings was 16 million 2014: 18 million and the net carrying amount of leased plant and equipment was 30 million 2014: 34 million.
Further details in respect of leases and lease obligations are provided in note 4.4.
Capital commitments At the year end the Group has a number of outstanding capital commitments in respect of capital expenditure at its existing attractions and for Midway attractions that are under construction.
These are expected to be settled within two financial years of the reporting date.
These amount to 32 million 2014: 50 million for which no provision has been made.
In addition, at year end foreign exchange rates, the Group is expecting to invest a further 98 million in LEGOLAND Japan and LEGOLAND Korea over the period from 2016 to 2018.
3.2 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting policies Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired less any contingent liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.
Where they arise on acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, including amounts into perpetuity.
Currently all such brands held are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives.
This is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the demonstrable chaining of brands, and the Directors intentions regarding the future use of brands.
The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a finite life on the brands.
The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets comprise software licences, sponsorship rights and other contract based intangible assets.

They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

As a result of these tests, no impairment charges have been made in the year 2014: nil.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups operating segments which represent the lowest level at which it is monitored and tested for impairment.
It is denominated in the relevant local currencies and therefore the carrying value is subject to movements in the underlying exchange rates.

3.3 Impairment testing Accounting policies The carrying amounts of the Groups goodwill, intangible assets and PPE are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount.
The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows: Asset Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed at an Operating Group level, being the relevant grouping of cash-generating units CGUs at which the benefit of such goodwill arises.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows, being the Groups individual attractions.
Brands Brands are reviewed individually.
PPE PPE is reviewed at an attraction level.
129 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 3.3 Impairment testing continued For assets that are in continuing use but do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the assets belong.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill, and then to reduce the carrying amount of other intangible assets and other assets on a pro rata basis.
Calculation of recoverable amount In accordance with accounting standards the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
To assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
The Group uses a multiple of EBITDA to estimate fair value which is based on the Groups average market capitalisation as a multiple of the Groups underlying EBITDA.
The Groups internally approved five year business plans, being the current year and four future years, are used as the basis for these calculations, with cash flows beyond the four year outlook period then extrapolated using a long term growth rate.
Common assumptions have been adopted for the purpose of testing goodwill across the business and for testing brand values as their risk profiles are similar.
The key assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the Groups businesses are as follows: Estimate Future cash flows Assumed to be equivalent to the operating cash flows of the businesses less the cash flows in respect of capital expenditure.
The Group uses EBITDA as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted by movements in working capital.
Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs.
Visitor numbers and revenue projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity.
Operating costs projections are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions.
Timing and quantum of future Projections are based on the attractions long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment capital and maintenance necessary to maintain and sustain the performance of the attractions assets.
expenditure Long term growth rate A growth rate of 2.5% 2014: 2.5% was determined based on managements long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
Discount rates to reflect Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a market participant within the main geographical the risks involved regions where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset specific risks.
The key assumptions of the market participant include the ratio of debt to equity financing, risk free rates and the medium term risks associated with equity investments.
Net present values are calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate of between 9.1% and 12.7% 2014: 9.4% and 13.1%, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of between 7.2% and 9.4% 2014: 7.4% and 9.7%.
Sensitivity analysis Impairment reviews are often sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts considering incremental changes in the key assumptions of EBITDA, discount rate and long term growth rate in relation to value in use calculations.
When reviewing the outputs of the sensitivity analysis, particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited.
As in prior years, this solely relates to goodwill attributed to the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group RTP where the headroom is 55 million.
The Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks Operating Groups, as well as individual brands, show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions.
130 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 3.3 Impairment testing continued For RTP, where recoverable amount was based upon value in use, testing was performed on forward looking data extracted from the Groups strategic plan.
As this plan was prepared before the accident at Alton Towers in June, revised amounts have been included in the four year outlook period reflecting significant cost saving initiatives implemented at Alton Towers during 2015, as well as to consider future performance of the Operating Group including, but not limited to, the anticipated recovery in trading for Alton Towers in 2016 and beyond.
In undertaking sensitivity analysis for RTP, consideration has been given to increases in discount rates and movements in EBITDA.
It has also specifically considered the short and long term downside risks to EBITDA at Alton Towers.
These calculations do not take account of further potential operational cost or capital expenditure controls which would be possible were they required.
At the year end the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the current best estimate of future trading in RTP.
It is noted however that the calculations are inherently sensitive to the pace of the recovery at Alton Towers.
While in the short term a delay in the pace of the recovery would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fourth year of the plan which drive the terminal value would have a more significant impact.
If EBITDA for RTP as a whole were forecast to be 6% lower than currently anticipated for 2020, headroom would be absorbed in full.
While it is not impossible for such a shortfall to occur, the Directors do not consider it to be probable based on the strength of the product development, diversity across the businesses in RTP and our proven track record in scaling our cost base to respond to changing demand.
Discount rates have been derived from market data.
As these rates are intended to be long term in nature they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short term, however market discount rates could increase in future.
If the discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 6%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.
The Directors have formed their best estimate of the discount rate and do not consider that such a move in the rate is appropriate, but it is not impossible that a different view of discount rates could be required in the future.
The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan, was determined based on managements long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
The Directors do not consider it probable that this rate will prove to be inappropriate in the future, but note that if circumstances caused the rate to lower to 1.7%, headroom would be absorbed in full.
3.4 Working capital Accounting policies Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured using the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts considered by management to be uncollectible.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses.

132 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 3.5 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that expenditure will be required to settle those obligations.
They are measured at the Directors best estimates, after taking account of information available and different possible outcomes.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

These leases are typically of a duration of between ten and 60 years.
They are established on inception and discounted back to present value with the discount then being unwound through the income statement as part of finance costs.
They are reviewed at least annually.

There are no anticipated future events that would be expected to cause a material change in the timing or amount of outflows associated with the provisions.
133 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 4.1 Net debt Analysis of net debt Net debt is the total amount of cash and cash equivalents less interest-bearing loans and borrowings and finance lease liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits and other short term liquid investments such as money market funds which are subject to an insignificant risk of a change in value.

4.2 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Accounting policy Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less attributable fees.
These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate.
If the Group subsequently determines that the expected life has changed, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement.

The new committed facilities are: Bank facilities comprising 250 million, $540 million and 50 million floating rate term debt to mature in March 2020.
The relevant floating interest rates are LIBOR, the USD benchmark rate and EURIBOR, which were 0.59%, 0.57% and 0.13 % respectively at 26 December 2015.
The margin on the bank facilities is dependent on the Groups adjusted leverage ratio and is currently 2.0%.
A 300 million multi-currency revolving credit facility.
The margin on this facility is also dependent on the Groups adjusted leverage ratio and would currently be at a margin when drawn of 1.75% over the same floating interest rates.
A bond in the form of 500 million seven year notes with a coupon rate of 2.75% to mature in March 2022.
These new facilities enabled the repayment of the existing secured facilities due to mature in 2019.
The fees related to the new facilities are being amortised to the maturity of the debt as the debt is currently expected to be held for its full term.
All 2014 facilities were secured by fixed charges over the shares in certain Group companies and certain intra-group receivables.
This security was released in 2015.
The borrowings under the new bank facilities including the revolving credit facility and the 500 million bonds are unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
4.3 Financial risk management Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups Treasury Department produces short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are reviewed by the Groups Chief Financial Officer.
Surplus cash is actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or other short term liquid investments such as money market funds.
In some jurisdictions bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash.
As at the reporting date the Group had 152 million of cash and cash equivalents 2014: 285 million and a 300 million revolving credit facility, of which nil was drawn down 2014: 150 million of which nil drawn down, in order to meet its obligations and commitments that will fall due.
The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements.
This analysis assumes that interest rates prevailing at the reporting date remain constant.

The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps.
At 26 December 2015 the Group had 500 million of fixed rate debt.
Taken together with the floating rate bank facilities, that have been swapped to a fixed rate using interest rate swaps the accounting of which is set out below, in aggregate 75% 2014: 80% of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 5.2 years 2014: 2.1 years.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates.
It is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid ask spreads.
Following initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting.
When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items.
It makes an assessment, at inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of the hedge.
The effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income is removed and included in profit or loss in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income would be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
All interest rate swaps held by the Group are hedge accounted.
Sensitivity analysis Based on the net debt position as at 26 December 2015, taking into account interest rate swaps, each 100 basis points bp fall or rise in market interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in net interest paid of nil 2014: 1 million.
This has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Groups variable rate cash, borrowings and derivatives.
Foreign currency risk As the Group operates internationally the performance of the business is sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures: Transaction exposures The revenue and costs of the Groups operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local territories.
Any significant cross-border trading exposures are hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Translation exposures The Groups results, as presented in Sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hedge this translation exposure to its earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of its operating units.
The Groups debt is therefore denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling and at 26 December 2015 consisted of 550 million, $540 million and 250 million.
Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets.
These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets.
The Group also treats specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment.
In the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates.
At 26 December 2015 the fair value of foreign currency swaps was 1 million 2014: nil.

As described above, gains or losses in the income statement and equity are offset by the retranslation of the related foreign currency net assets or specific intercompany loan balances.
A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income statement of 4 million 2014: 9 million.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the Groups monetary assets.
The Group has limited credit risk with its customers, the vast majority of whom pay in advance or at the time of their visit.
There are credit policies in place with regard to its trade receivables with credit evaluations performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are measured against a formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterpartys credit position.
137 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 4.3 Financial risk management continued Fair values Fair value hierarchy The Group analyses financial instruments in the following ways: Level 1: uses unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: uses inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from observable prices other than quoted prices.
Level 3: uses inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Fair value versus carrying amounts The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below, together with the carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.
Short term receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation to fair value.

The fair values shown above for the bank facilities and loan notes have been calculated using market values and are classified as Level 2 and Level 1 respectively.
The fair values of the finance leases are determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
Of the financial assets and liabilities held at fair value, the derivative financial assets or liabilities are classified as Level 2 and the investments are classified as Level 3.
There have been no transfers between levels in 2015 or 2014.
138 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 4.4 Lease obligations Accounting policies Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received and predetermined non-contingent rent increases are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the lease term.
This therefore excludes the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on inflationary indices.
Lease arrangements The Groups most significant lease arrangements relate to a sale and leaseback transaction undertaken during 2007, involving the PPE of certain attractions within the Midway Attractions and Resort Theme Parks Operating Groups.
The leases are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the attraction.
For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement is split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction.
During 2012 the Group undertook a further sale and leaseback transaction of the LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel.
This is being accounted for as an operating lease.
Each of these sale and leaseback agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe.
The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time.
The Group also enters into operating leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas.
These are typically of a duration between ten and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice.
In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned.
Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned.
The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term.
The potential impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.
There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.
Lease costs and commitments During 2015 89 million 2014: 86 million was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases.
Of this 12 million 2014: 12 million was contingent on performance.
The lease commitments in the following tables run to the end of the respective lease term and do not include possible lease renewals.
Where relevant, the lease commitments noted do not include the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on inflationary indices.

The leases will be accounted for as finance or operating leases from the date the parks start operating depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the assets at the attractions.
140 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 4.5 Equity and capital management Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes borrowings see note 4.2, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent Company, as disclosed below.
The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business: to provide returns for shareholders: and to optimise the capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.
To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Groups capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and the requirements of the Groups debt covenants are met.
The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group.
Share plans have been created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Groups equity instruments, in order to ensure employees are focused on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.
The Groups equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of shares in the market.

Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company ranks equally in all respects and no shareholder holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the Company.
The Company has entered into a Relationship Agreement with its major shareholder, KIRKBI, in connection with the exercise of its rights as a major shareholder in the Company and the right to appoint Directors to the Board.
Relationship Agreements with Blackstone and CVC which were described in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 27 December 2014 terminated in March 2015 when they ceased to hold any shares in the Company.
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.
141 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 4.5 Equity and capital management continued Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.

The total dividend for the current year, subject to approval of the final dividend, will be 6.5 pence per share 2014: 6.2 pence per share.
Capital reserve Balances arose in the capital reserve when the Groups previous parent company, Merlin Entertainments S. r. l. arranged its own acquisition by Merlin Entertainments plc, a new legal parent.
The balances represented the difference between the value of the equity structure of the previous and new parent companies.
On 26 February 2014 the Company reduced its share capital by means of a court sanctioned reduction of capital, which resulted in an increase in available reserves for distribution by way of dividends to shareholders in the amount of 3,183 million.
When the capital position of the parent Company was rearranged the capital reserve was adjusted appropriately such that the equity balances presented in the Group accounts best reflected the underlying structure of the Groups capital base.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
4.6 Share-based payment transactions Accounting policy The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to retained earnings, net of deferred tax.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant.
Non-market based vesting conditions i. e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest, which is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive plans for employees in certain territories.
The issues and resulting charges of these plans are not material to the financial statements.
Equity-settled plans The Group operates four employee share incentive plans: the Performance Share Plan PSP, the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, the Company Share Option Plan CSOP and the All Employee Sharesave Plan AESP as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report and the tables below.
A summary of the rules for the plans and the performance conditions attaching to the PSP are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.

The Black-Scholes model is used to value the AESP.
Due to limited trading history in the Groups shares, the expected volatility is based on a portfolio of comparator companies.
The risk free rate is equal to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.
Expected forfeiture rates are based on recent experience of staff turnover levels.
Behavioural expectations have been estimated in estimating the award life.
The charge is spread over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
144 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 5.1 Investments Accounting policy As no observable market data is available for the Groups existing investments, fair value is determined by reference to discounted future cash flows, with movements recorded in other comprehensive income.
No fair value movements have been recorded and there is no material sensitivity to the assumptions used.
2015 2014 m m At beginning of year 6 3 Additions 5 3 At end of year 11 6 LEGOLAND Malaysia In 2013 the Group acquired 16,350,300 shares in IDR Resorts Sdn.
IDR for the consideration of 3 million.
During the year the Group acquired an additional 26,149,700 shares for the consideration of 5 million.
IDR is accounted for at fair value and is not consolidated.
IDR and its subsidiaries are deemed to be related parties as the Group is committed to subscribing for share capital in IDR which together with its subsidiaries owns LEGOLAND Malaysia see note 5.3.
LEGOLAND Korea In 2014 the Group made a 3 million investment in the consortium company developing LEGOLAND Korea.
The investment is accounted for at fair value and is not consolidated.
5.2 Employee benefits Accounting policies Defined contribution pension schemes In the case of defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to them.
The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the employer.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes A defined benefit scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme other than a defined contribution scheme.
The Groups net obligation is calculated for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity through other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes and the total expense relating to those schemes in the current year was 10 million 2014: 10 million.
Defined benefit pension schemes The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was acquired in 2007.
The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided.
The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.
145 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 5.2 Employee benefits continued The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2013.
As a result, the Group agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of 455,500 per annum until 2018, together with an additional one-off payment of 350,000 which was paid in 2014.
The Group expects 1 million in contributions to be paid to its defined benefit schemes in 2015.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 26 December 2015 was 20 years.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes are: 2015 2014 m m Equities 23 23 Corporate bonds and cash 5 5 Fair value of scheme assets 28 28 Present value of defined benefit obligations 33 33 Net pension liability 5 5 Movement in the net pension liability Present value Present value of of scheme defined benefit Net pension assets obligations liability m m m At 29 December 2013 17 21 4 Net interest 1 1 - Contributions by employer 1 - 1 Benefits paid 1 1 - Remeasurement gain loss 2 3 1 Recognition of defined contribution section assets and liabilities 8 9 1 28 33 5 At 27 December 2014 Net interest 1 1 - Contributions by employer 1 - 1 Benefits paid 1 1 - Remeasurement loss 1 - 1 At 26 December 2015 28 33 5 The amount recognised in the income statement was nil 2014: nil.
The amount recognised in the statement of comprehensive income was a loss of 1 million 2014: loss of 2 million.
The closed Tussauds Group scheme operated a defined contribution section underpinned by a minimum level of benefit.
Recent experience has indicated that this minimum level of benefit is now giving rise to a deficit: consequently the assets and liabilities of the defined contribution section of the scheme were recognised in 2014.
146 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 5.2 Employee benefits continued Actuarial assumptions Principal actuarial assumptions expressed as weighted averages at the year end were: 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.9% 3.9% Future salary increases 3.5% 3.5% Rate of price inflation 3.2% 3.2% Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables.
For the Tussauds Group scheme the actuarial table used is S1PA.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 85 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 88.
5.3 Related party transactions Identity of related parties The Group has related party relationships with a major shareholder, key management personnel, joint ventures and IDR Resorts Sdn.

We continue to fully support the Health and Safety Executive HSE as they undertake their investigation.
It is possible that additional uninsured costs and, depending on the outcome of the HSE investigation, financial penalties may be incurred.
At this stage these costs are not anticipated to be material in the context of the Groups financial statements.

148 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES continued 52 weeks ended 26 December 2015 5.5 New standards and interpretations The following standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements: IAS 19 Amendment Employee benefits - defined benefit plans: employee contributions.
IFRS 2 Amendment Share-based payment - definition of vesting condition.
IFRS 3 Amendment Business combinations - classification and measurement of contingent consideration and scope exclusion for the formation of joint arrangements.
IFRS 8 Amendment Operating segments - disclosures on the aggregation of operating segments.
IFRS 13 Amendment Fair value measurement - measurement of short term receivables and payables and scope of portfolio exception.
IAS 16 Amendment Property, plant and equipment.
IAS 24 Amendment Related party disclosures - definition of related party.
EU endorsed IFRS and interpretations with effective dates after 26 December 2015 relevant to the Group will be implemented in the financial year when the standards become effective.
The IASB has issued the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that will be effective for the Group as from 1 January 2016.
The Group does not expect any significant impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements - accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations.
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38 Intangible assets - clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation.
IAS 27 Separate financial statements - equity method.
IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations - changes in method for disposal.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - continuing involvement for servicing contracts.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits - discount rate in a regional market sharing the same currency - e. g. the Eurozone.
IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements - disclosure initiative.
During 2014 the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, which will become effective from the 2018 accounting period.
The Groups revenue is generated by high volumes of low value transactions, thereby requiring limited judgement on accounting for revenue compared to other industry sectors.
The Group considers that the implementation of this new standard will not have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016 the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which will become effective from the 2019 accounting period.
It is anticipated that this will require many of the Groups leases to be accounted for on balance sheet and will result in significant changes to the presentation of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
It will therefore be a key area of focus.
5.6 Ultimate parent company information The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by Merlin Entertainments plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom.
No other group financial statements include the results of the Company.
5.7 Subsequent events On 24 February 2016 the Group invested $34.4 million 24.6 million in Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited, the leading global owner-operator of Hop On Hop Off City Tours.
The consideration will be settled in cash and will provide Merlin with a minority equity holding and an investment in loan notes.
