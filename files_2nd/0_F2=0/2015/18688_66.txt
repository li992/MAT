Financial policies for risk management and their objectives Credit and concentration of risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks, without recourse discounts, and other allowances.
A provision for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, customers in the MENA region are offered relatively long payment terms compared to customers in Europe and the US.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Groups largest two customers in the MENA region represented 9.9% of Group revenue, 6.4% from one customer in Saudi Arabia, and 3.5% from a customer in Algeria.
At 31 December 2015, the amount of receivables due from all customers based in Saudi Arabia was $119 million 2014: $110 million, and in Algeria was $66 million 2014: $46 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, three key US wholesalers represented 32.6% of Group revenue 2014: 37%.
The amount of receivables due from all US customers at 31 December 2015 was $109 million 2014: $75 million.
The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies, procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the creditworthiness of a particular customer.
The Group is exposed to a variety of customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic risks vary across the Group.
Typical credit terms in the US range from 30-90 days, in Europe 30-120 days, and in MENA 180-360 days.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Market risk The Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital and monitors its liquidity to have reasonable assurance that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and deliver its growth strategy objectives whilst reducing its cost of capital and maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity mix.
The Group regularly reviews the capital structure by considering the level of available capital and the short to medium-term strategic plans concerning future capital spend, as well as the need to meet dividends, banking covenants, and borrowing ratios.
The Group defines capital as equity plus net funds, which include bank overdrafts and loans note 24, obligations under finance leases note 29, long-term financial debts note 28, net of cash and cash equivalents note 22, and collateralised and restricted cash note 21.
