ASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to maximise the use of observable market data and minimise the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes.
Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value.
Inputs may be observable or unobservable.
Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities.
Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgement.
Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active and for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
Inputs are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk.
Inputs may include price information, volatility statistics, specific and broad credit data, liquidity statistics, and other factors.
A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
However, the determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Companys Directors.
The Directors consider observable data to be that market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The categorisation of a financial instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the Directors perceived risk of that instrument.
