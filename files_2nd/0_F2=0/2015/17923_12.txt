1 Strategic Report continued 1.11 Summary of consolidated performance 1.11.1 Selected financial information Our selected financial information reflects the operations of the BHP Billiton Group, and should be read in conjunction with the FY2015 Financial Statements, together with the accompanying notes.
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and as outlined in note 41 Basis of preparation and measurement to the Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
We publish our Consolidated Financial Statements in US dollars.
Comparative financial information for FY2014, FY2013, FY2012 and FY2011 has been restated for the effects of the application of IFRS 5 AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations following the demerger of South32, unless otherwise noted.
The Consolidated Balance Sheet for these periods is not required to be and has not been restated, for further information refer to note 41 Basis of preparation and measurement to the Financial Statements.
We use several financial measures to monitor the financial performance of our overall strategy.
The two key measures are Profit after taxation attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group Attributable profit and Underlying EBIT.

3 The Consolidated Balance Sheet for FY2015 does not include the assets and liabilities of the Businesses demerged with South32.
IFRS 5 AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations does not require the Consolidated Balance Sheet to be restated for comparative periods.
4 Underlying attributable profit, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA are non-IFRS financial measures that we use to reflect the underlying performance of BHP Billiton.
Underlying attributable profit is Attributable profit excluding Discontinued operations and any exceptional items.
Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation, Discontinued operations and any exceptional items.
Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT before depreciation, impairments and amortisation.
We believe that Underlying attributable profit, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA provide useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or as an alternative to, Attributable profit as an indicator of actual operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA are included in the FY2015 Consolidated Financial Statements as required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments and are disclosed in sections 1.15.3 Operating results and 2.5 Business performance.
5 Represents the share of capital and exploration expenditure attributable to BHP Billiton shareholders on a cash basis.
Includes BHP Billiton proportionate share of equity accounted investments, capital and exploration expenditure from Discontinued operations: excludes capitalised deferred stripping and non-controlling interests.
6 Net operating cash flows are after dividends received, net interest and taxation and include net operating cash flows from Discontinued operations.

3 Includes exceptional items of US$ nil 2014: US$ nil: 2013: credit of US$158 million.
Total expenses increased from US$36.5 billion in FY2014 to US$37.0 billion in FY2015.
Total expenses excluding exceptional items of US$3.2 billion, the majority of which related to impairments in FY2015, decreased by US$2.7 billion or seven per cent during FY2015 from US$36.5 billion to US$33.8 billion.
The increase of non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortisation of US$1.4 billion and impairments not classified as exceptional items of US$350 million, was more than offset by our ability to reduce operating costs across all of our Businesses, demonstrated by the delivery of a US$2.7 billion reduction in cash cost efficiencies and a favourable foreign exchange impact of US$1.7 billion.
Reductions in expenses excluding exceptional items were evident in Raw materials and consumables used of US$873 million, External services including transportation of US$971 million, Employee benefit expense of US$442 million, Third party commodity purchases of US$537 million, and Government royalties paid and payable of US$704 million.
Total operating costs were aided by favourable exchange rates, including a favourable restatement of monetary items in the balance sheet of US$637 million compared to FY2014.
For further information, refer to note 42 Functional and presentation currency to the Financial Statements.
Other income decreased from US$1.2 billion in FY2014 to US$496 million in FY2015, mainly due to the gain on sale for the Pinto Valley mining operation of US$551 million recognised in FY2014.
For further information, refer to note 5 Other income to the Financial Statements.
Profit from operations decreased by US$13.9 billion or 62 per cent, from US$22.6 billion to US$8.7 billion.
Gross exceptional items during FY2015 comprised an impairment of Onshore US assets of US$2.8 billion and an impairment of Nickel West assets of US$409 million, compared with gross exceptional income of US$551 million in FY2014.
Underlying EBIT Underlying EBIT is a key measure that management uses internally to assess the performance of our Businesses, make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess operational management.
Management uses this measure because financing structures and tax regimes differ across our assets and substantial components of our tax and interest charges are levied at a Group level rather than an operational level.
We exclude exceptional items from Underlying EBIT in order to enhance the comparability of the measure from period to period and provide clarity into the underlying performance of our operations.
Our management monitors exceptional items separately.
For FY2015, Underlying EBIT declined by 46 per cent to US$11.9 billion.
Further analysis of Underlying EBIT for the Businesses is included in section 1.12 and for the Group in section 1.15.3 of this Annual Report.
The following table reconciles Underlying EBIT to Profit from operations.
2015 2014 2013 US$M US$M US$M Year ended 30 June Restated Restated Underlying EBIT 11,866 22,098 21,680 Exceptional items before taxation refer section 1.15.3 3,196 551 297 Profit from operations EBIT 8,670 22,649 21,977 32 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2015 1 Strategic Report 2 Business overview 3 Corporate Governance Statement 4 Remuneration Report 5 Directors Report 1.11.1 Selected financial information continued Net finance costs Net finance costs decreased by US$300 million to US$614 million in FY2015.
The decrease reflected foreign exchange gains on finance leases and the early redemption of the Petrohawk Energy Corporation Senior Notes in August 2014, which resulted in a gain on redemption and lower interest expense.
Taxation expense Total taxation expense decreased by US$3.1 billion to US$3.7 billion in FY2015.
This decrease was mainly driven by the decrease of Profit before taxation.
The adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the influence of exchange rate movements, remeasurement of deferred tax assets associated with the MRRT and exceptional items, decreased from 32.2 per cent to 31.8 per cent.
Discontinued operations South32s contribution to BHP Billitons FY2015 results comprised US$753 million Profit after taxation, excluding exceptional items.
Exceptional items comprised a tax expense of US$111 million related to the repeal of the MRRT and a net loss on the demerger of US$2.2 billion after tax benefit.
This contribution has been included in Loss attributable to members of BHP Billiton Group from Discontinued operations of US$1.6 billion.
Underlying attributable profit The following table reconciles Underlying attributable profit to Attributable profit.
2015 2014 2013 Year ended 30 June US$M US$M US$M Underlying attributable profit 6,417 13,263 12,017 Attributable loss Discontinued operations 1,573 184 1,475 Exceptional items after taxation 2,946 385 681 Minority interest in exceptional items 12 Attributable profit 1,910 13,832 11,223 Attributable profit decreased by 86 per cent to US$1.9 billion mainly driven by a significant decline in commodity prices and included an Attributable loss related to Discontinued operations of US$1.6 billion.
Underlying basic earnings per share of 120.7 US cents is calculated using Underlying attributable profit divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Other financial information Net operating cash flows from Continuing operations decreased by 25 per cent to US$17.8 billion during FY2015.
The major contributor was the US$7.7 billion decrease in cash generated from operations after changes in working capital balances, which was partially offset by a decrease of US$2.1 billion in net taxes paid.
Despite the significant decline in commodity prices, we generated US$6.3 billion of free cash flow during the period as we further improved both operating and capital productivity and exercised the flexibility in our investment program.
In this regard, we invested US$11.0 billion in capital projects and exploration BHP Billiton share for Continuing operations during the year.
We finished the period with net debt of US$24.4 billion 2014: US$25.8 billion for a gearing ratio of 25.7 per cent 2014: 23.2 per cent.
The FY2014 figures therefore includes assets and liabilities of the Businesses demerged with South32.

1.11.3 Projects and pipeline Our project pipeline focuses on commodities that are expected to be high-margin and create significant future value.
During FY2015, three major projects achieved first production for a total capital expenditure subject to finalisation of US$6.7 billion.
At the end of FY2015, we had four major projects under development with a combined budget of US$7.0 billion.
This budget does not include an additional US$1.5 billion of capital expenditure that we expect to spend in FY2016 on development of our Onshore US asset.
For more information on our major projects and pipeline refer to sections 1.12, 2.1 and 2.4 of this Annual Report.
