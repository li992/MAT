Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill Details of contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill are set out in Note 2.
Contingent liabilities not related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2015 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the groups business.
No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Further information is included in Note 28.
In the normal course of the groups business, legal proceedings are pending or may be brought against BP group entities arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals.
BP believes that the impact of these legal proceedings on the groups results of operations, liquidity or financial position will notbe material.
With respect to lead pigment in paint in particular, Atlantic Richfield, a subsidiary of BP, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the legal proceedings, Atlantic Richfield believes it has valid defences that render the incurrence of a liability remote: however, the amounts claimed and the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial.
The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed against Atlantic Richfield.
No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled nor has Atlantic Richfield been subject to a final adverse judgment in any proceeding.
Atlantic Richfield intends to defend such actions vigorously.
The group files tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world.
Various tax authorities are currently examining the groups tax returns.
Tax returns contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete.
While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, the group does not anticipate that there will be any material impact upon the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
