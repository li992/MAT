Complexities in the Group structure mean these losses may be inaccessible and the Group intends to convert to REIT status in early 2017.
Accordingly, the recognised deferred tax asset has been restricted to those losses which are likely be utilised in the next financial year.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
Deferred tax at 31 December 2015 has been calculated based on the rate at which it is expected to reverse.
Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary differences of 104.9 million 2014: 69.3 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
