| LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 237 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Interest expense Interest expense reects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments The companys activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Borrowings classied as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates.
Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Pension costs The company participates in the group dened benefit schemes, which are recognised on the Balance Sheet of Legal & General Resources Limited.

Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the companys Balance Sheet.
The assets of the dened benefit schemes and the dened contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualied actuaries.
Share-based payments The company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries.
The fair value of the equity instruments granted is spread over the vesting period of the instrument and treated as a capital contribution to the respective subsidiary.
The total capital contribution is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
The capital contribution to the subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase in the investment in the parent companys financial statements.
At each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimate, if any, in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the accumulated capital contribution and the actual cost to the company is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
Any capital contribution is subsequently recharged to the respective subsidiary as incurred and the corresponding cost of investment is reduced.
