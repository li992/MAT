128 Financial statements Notes to the Income Statement and Other Comprehensive Income RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Income Statement and Other Comprehensive Income 9 Segmental information Following a strategic review of its operations in 2014, the Group has disposed of or is in the process of disposing of a number of its businesses.
Further information on the Groups disposal activity is disclosed in note 7.
As a result of the review, the Groups operating segments of Scandinavia, Canada, UK & Ireland, Central Functions and non-core are split between core and non-core businesses, which is consistent with how the Group is managed.
These operating segments are based on geography and all are engaged in providing personal and commercial general insurance services.
Central functions include the Groups internal reinsurance function and Group Corporate Centre.
Core businesses The Groups core businesses are Scandinavia, Canada, and UK & Ireland.
These represent three separate operating segments, and the major geographical areas in which the Group continues to operate through established businesses in mature markets.
Each operating segment is managed by a member of the Group Executive Committee who is directly accountable to the Group Chief Executive and Board of Directors, who together form the central decision making function in respect of the operating activities of the Group.
The UK is the Groups country of domicile and one of its principal markets.
Amounts attributable to Central Functions are also included within the core business results.
Non-Core businesses The Groups non-core businesses in the table below comprises of the Groups UK legacy business and Middle East operation.
The Middle East is a separate operating segment, and the Groups UK legacy business is part of the UK operations.
As businesses become classified as discontinued see note 7 their results on a segmental basis are re-presented from non-core and into discontinued operations including restating the 2014 comparatives.
Assessing segment performance The Group uses the following key measures to assess the performance of its operating segments: Net written premiums: Underwriting result: Combined operating ratio COR : Operating result.
Net written premiums is the key measure of revenue used in internal reporting.
Underwriting result, COR and Operating result are the key internal measures of profitability of the operating segments.
The COR reflects the ratio of claims costs and expenses including commission to earned premiums, expressed as a percentage.
Transfers or transactions between segments are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.

The 2014 non-recurring charge of 67m of which 58m was attributable to continuing operations and 9m to discontinued operations related to the revisions of estimates including the re-estimation of deferred acquisition costs and dilapidation provisions in respect of leasehold properties resulting in charges of 17m and 5m respectively and a review of the Groups reinsurance accounting resulted in a charge of 22m.
Finally, as a result of a remediation process, better information became available which resulted in certain revisions to accounting estimates and a charge of 23m which predominantly related to the Irish business.

Performance Share Plan Awards of Performance Shares to executive directors and other selected executives are subject to performance conditions consisting of the Groups underlying return on tangible equity relative to Total Shareholder Return and Business Review Scorecard targets over a three-year performance period.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee may also make conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers, which are not subject to performance conditions.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus limited to 50% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Deferred Bonus Shares, which are also not subject to performance conditions.
If an employee resigns from the Group, then Performance Shares and Restricted Shares lapse at date of leaving the Group.
Deferred Bonus Shares awards are generally retained by the employee to whom the share was granted if they leave the Group, unless the employee is dismissed for cause.
However, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to modify the treatment of leavers share awards that have yet to be released, based on the leaving circumstances, where this is appropriate and in shareholders interests.
Awards retained will vest on the normal vesting date.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The Long-Term Incentive Plan was replaced by the Performance Share Plan at the end of 2013.
No awards have been granted under this plan since 2013 year end.

21 Distributions paid and proposed The final dividend to equity holders is recognised as a liability when approved at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company and its subsidiaries may be subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to shareholders as a result of regulatory requirements.
However, based on the information currently available, the Group does not believe that such restrictions materially impact the ability to meet obligations or pay dividends.
At the Annual General Meeting AGM on 6 May 2016, a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 of 7p per ordinary share amounting to a total dividend of 71m is to be proposed.
The proposed dividend will be paid and accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2016.

Impairments Due to software replacement, a software impairment charge of 1m 2014: 44m has been recognised within other operating expenses.
In 2015, 2m 2014: 4m impairment was charged to underwriting and policy acquisition costs.
When testing for impairment, the carrying value of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is compared to the recoverable amount as determined by a value in use calculation.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on operating plans approved by management covering a three year period and are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses and taxes using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information as discussed in more detail in the strategic report section.
Cashflows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which management deem appropriate for the CGU.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Where a sales price has been agreed for CGU, the sales proceeds are considered the best estimate of the value in use.
Where the value in use is less than the current carrying value of the CGU in the Statement of Financial Position, the goodwill is impaired in order to ensure that the CGU carrying value is not greater than its future value to the Group.
Goodwill impairment charges of 18m 2014: 55m have been recognised within other operating expenses, split between discontinued operations 12m 2014: 11m and Scandinavia 6m 2014: UK & Ireland 44m for the Argentinian and Scandinavian Marine subsidiaries respectively.
140 Financial statements Notes to the Statement of Financial Position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Statement of Financial Position continued Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs, which are contained within the following operating segments as follows: 2015 2014 m m Scandinavia 131 146 Canada 130 147 UK & Ireland 30 31 Non-core and discontinued 72 88 Total Goodwill 363 412 The value in use and key assumptions used in determining the value in use for the Scandinavian Marine CGU are as follows: Scandinavia Marine Value in Use 11m Discount Rate 11% Weighted average growth rate 2% The impairment of 6m in Scandinavia is related to the Marine business due to the value in use exceeding the carrying value.
This impairment on the Marine business is due to the use of prudent assumptions around the future profitability of the business.
The carrying value of the goodwill of 6m has been fully impaired.
Goodwill of 12m in respect of the Groups Argentinian business has been impaired prior to its classification as Held for Sale in order to reduce the carrying value of its CGU to its recoverable value in use amount, which was determined as its expected net disposal proceeds.
Impairment Sensitivity Following completion of the Group impairment testing, it was identified that an additional Scandinavian CGU was sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
This is the Norway CGU and the sensitivities are listed below.
Norway Potential impairment m Impairment Sensitivity Headroom after 1% decrease in terminal value growth rate 10 Headroom after 1% increase to discount rate 13 At half year 2014, the Irish operation was impaired to its carrying value.
The impairment test for this operation at full year 2015 indicates that there is sufficient headroom in the operation to support the goodwill.

In such circumstances the Group may apply hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS and the Group accounting policy on hedging.
The Group applies hedge accounting to derivatives acquired to reduce foreign exchange risk in its net investment in certain major overseas subsidiaries.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in respect of these hedges during 2015 or 2014.
The Group also applies hedge accounting to specified fixed interest assets in its investment portfolio.
During 2014, the Group invested in a portfolio of high investment grade corporate bonds denominated in US dollars to allow it to invest in a more diversified range of issuers.
These investments are used to cover the insurance liabilities in the UK business.
In order to remove exchange risk from this portfolio of investments the Group also acquired cross currency interest rate swaps to swap the cashflows from the portfolio into cashflows denominated in pounds Sterling.
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting when using fixed to floating interest rate swaps and cashflow hedge accounting when using fixed to fixed interest rate swaps.
The interest rate swaps exactly offset the timing and amounts expected to be received on the underlying investments.
The investments have a remaining term of between two and eight years.
There have been no default and no defaults are expected on the hedged investments.
The total losses on cashflow hedge instruments during 2015 was a 4m loss 2014: profit of 4m in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, and the amount reclassified to the income statement was nil 2014: nil.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement was nil 2014: nil.
The total losses on the fair value hedge instruments recognised in the income statement were 19m 2014: 11m and the offsetting gains related to the hedged risk were 18m 2014: 8m.
The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting arrangements.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owned by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one counterparty to the other.
In certain circumstances, such as a credit default, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position.
This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events.
In the occurrence of the future event, the related items not offset in the table above would total nil 2014: 6m assets and 79m 2014: 53m liabilities.
In 2014, the Group also entered into similar arrangements with Repurchase Agreements under a master repurchase agreement.
The related items not offset in 2014 totalled 299m.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Notes to the statement of financial position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 145 27 Fair value measurement Fair value is used to value a number of assets within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and represents its market value at the reporting date.
Cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables For cash, loans and receivables, commercial paper, other assets, liabilities and accruals, their carrying amounts are considered to be as approximate fair values.
Group occupied property and investment property Group occupied properties are valued on a vacant possession basis using third-party valuers.
Investment properties are valued, at least annually, at their highest and best use.
The fair value of property has been determined by external, independent valuers, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.
The valuations of buildings with vacant possession are based on the comparative method of valuation with reference to sales of other vacant buildings.
Fair value is then determined based on the locational qualities and physical building characteristics principally condition, size, specification and layout as appropriate.
Investment properties are valued using discounted cashflow models which take into account the net present value of cashflows to be generated from the properties.
The cashflow streams reflect the current rent the gross rent payable to lease expiry, at which point it is assumed that each unit will be re-let at its estimated rental value.
Allowances have been made for voids and rent free periods where applicable.
The appropriate rent to be capitalised is selected on the basis of the location of the building, its quality, tenant credit quality and lease terms amongst other factors.
These cashflows are discounted at an appropriate rate of interest to determine their present value.
In both cases the estimated fair value would increase decrease if: The estimated rental value is higher lower Void periods were shorter longer The occupancy rate were higher lower Rent free periods were shorter longer The discount rates were lower higher.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are financial contracts whose fair value is determined on a market basis by reference to underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity or commodity instrument or indices.
Loan capital The fair value measurement of the Groups loan capital instruments, with the exception of the subordinated guaranteed US$ bonds, are based on pricing obtained from a range of financial intermediaries who base their valuations on recent transactions of the Groups loan capital instruments and other observable market inputs such as applicable risk free rate and appropriate credit risk spreads.
The fair value measurement of the subordinated guaranteed US$ bonds is also obtained from an indicative valuation based on the applicable risk free rate and appropriate credit risk spread.
Fair value hierarchy Fair value for all assets and liabilities which are either measured or disclosed is determined based on available information and categorised according to a three-level fair value hierarchy as detailed below.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from data other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
146 Financial statements Notes to the statement of financial position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the statement of financial position continued A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market Level 1 if quoted prices for that financial instrument are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
Quoted prices are not always available, or the asset may not be traded very often or not at all on a market.
In these instances, internal calculations that maximise the use of observable data are used to estimate fair value.
The valuation technique, which is predominantly used is discounted cashflows.
This incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.
When all significant inputs to the calculation are observable, then the valuation is classified as a Level 2 valuation.
In limited circumstances, the Group uses input parameters that are not based on observable market data.
Unobservable inputs are based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions for the same instrument nor based on available market data.
In these cases, judgement is required to establish fair values.
Valuations that require the significant use of unobservable data are considered Level 3 valuations.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments and other items that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value as well as financial liabilities not measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3.
The table does not include financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

An increase of 100bps in the discount rate used to value the UK property portfolio would result in a decrease of 62m in the fair value of the portfolio.
The Group investments in financial assets classified at Level 3 in the hierarchy are primarily investments in various private fund structures investing in debt instruments where the valuation includes estimates of the credit spreads on the underlying holdings.
The estimates of the credit spread are based upon market observable credit spreads for what are considered to be assets with similar credit risk.
The aggregate value of these holdings included in the table above at 31 December 2015 is 404m.
An increase in the estimate of the credit spread of the underlying holdings of 100bps would result in a reduction in the fair value of these investments of 19m.
28 Interests in structured entities A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group does not securitise any of its investments in financial instruments and does not create, promote or administer structured entities on behalf of third-party investors.
The Group therefore considers that it does not act as a sponsor for any structured entity.
However, the Group invests in unleveraged entities created by and managed by external specialist investment managers where investments are pooled within an investment vehicle to provide a diversified exposure to particular classes of underlying investments.
The use of these products allows the Group to broaden the diversification of its investment portfolio in a cost-efficient manner.
The Group normally limits its exposures in individual structured entities to less than 20% of the total capital of the entity.
The Group is exposed to the risks of the underlying investments of the investment vehicles.
The investment return from the structured entities is expected to reflect the returns from the underlying investments of the underlying vehicles.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Notes to the statement of financial position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 149 In addition, the Group has commitments for future undrawn subscriptions limited to the amounts set out in the subscription agreements.
The Group has no obligations to provide any additional funding or other financial support to these entities.
The Group has determined that its maximum exposure to structured entities is the sum of the carrying value and the undrawn commitments.

This includes 4m 2014: 32m which will expire between 2016 and 2024 and 1,210m 2014: 1,330m capital losses for which it is unlikely that a deferred tax asset would be recognised mainly due to UK exemptions.
In addition, the Group has unused tax credits of nil 2014: 16m and deductible temporary differences of 486m 2014: 456m for which no deferred tax has been recognised.
The Group has temporary differences in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates not held for sale of 1,053m 2014: 1,093m on which overseas taxes, including withholding taxes, might be incurred on the remittance of these earnings to the UK.
This amount relates predominantly to the Groups subsidiaries in Canada.
The Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit the retained earnings in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental tax liability.
As such the Group has not recognised any deferred tax in respect of the potential taxes on the temporary differences arising on unremitted earnings of continuing overseas subsidiaries and associates.
Of the 123m 2014: 118m net deferred tax asset recognised by the Groups continuing operations, 117m 2014: 123m relate to tax jurisdictions in which the Group has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period.
The assets have been recognised on the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these deferred tax assets can be utilised.

37 Insurance contract liabilities Estimation techniques and uncertainties Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to a robust reserving process by each of the Groups business units and at Group Corporate Centre, as detailed in the Risk Management note.
The Group also engage external independent advisors to perform detailed reviews of major classes of specialist business where there is greatest inherent risk of uncertainty, for example the Groups exposure to asbestos related losses, to help inform the amount of the provision recognised.
There is also considerable uncertainty in regard to the eventual outcome of the claims that have occurred by the end of the reporting period but remain unsettled.
This includes claims that may have occurred but have not yet been notified to the Group and those that are not yet apparent to the insured.
The provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using previous claims experience with similar cases, historical payment trends, the volume and nature of the insurance underwritten by the Group and current specific case reserves.
Also considered are developing loss payment trends, the potential longer-term significance of large events, and the levels of unpaid claims, legislative changes, judicial decisions and economic, political and regulatory conditions.
The Group uses a number of commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies to determine the appropriate provision to recognise.
These include methods based upon the following: The development of previously settled claims, where payments to date are extrapolated for each prior year Estimates based upon a projection of claims numbers and average cost Notified claims development, where notified claims to date for each year are extrapolated based upon observed development of earlier years Expected loss ratios Bornhuetter Ferguson method, which combines features of the above methods Bespoke methods for specialist classes of business.
In selecting the method and estimate appropriate to any one class of insurance business, the Group considers the appropriateness of the methods and bases to the individual circumstances of the provision class and underwriting year.
Individually large and significant claims are generally assessed separately, being measured either at the face value of the loss adjusters estimates or projected separately in order to allow for the future development of large claims.
The level of provision carried by the Group targets the inclusion of a margin of 5% for the core businesses on top of the Actuarial Indication outlined above.
The appropriateness of the 5% target is subject to regular review as part of the Group reserving process at Group Corporate Centre.
Discount assumptions The total value of provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses less related reinsurance recoveries before discounting for continuing operations is 8,766m 2014: 9,463m.
Claims on certain classes of business excluding annuities have been discounted as follows: Average number of years to Discount rate settlement from reporting date 2015 2014 2015 2014 Category % % Years Years UK Asbestos and environmental 4.0 4.0 11 11 Scandinavia Disability 1.3 1.3 8 6 156 Financial statements Notes to the statement of financial position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the statement of financial position continued In determining the average number of years to ultimate claims settlement, estimates have been made based on the underlying claims settlement patterns.
As at 31 December 2015, the value of the discount on net claims liability reserves is 403m 2014: 444m excluding annuities and periodic payment orders.
All other factors remaining constant, a decrease of 1% in the discount rates would reduce the value of the discount by approximately 127m.
A decrease of 1% in the real discount rate for UK and Scandinavia annuities would reduce the value of the discount by approximately 86m.
The sensitivity calculation has taken into consideration the undiscounted provisions for each class of business and the respective average settlement period.

The estimated provisions for ultimate incurred losses change as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial provisions were set up and as the rates of exchange.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 9m 2014: 9m were paid to this scheme during 2015 and are included in the costs shown above.
The expected contributions in 2016 are 9m.
Total estimated contributions to the scheme from all employers in 2015 were 51m.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2015, when the scheme funding rate was 114% 2014: 110%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits Independent actuaries calculate the value of the defined benefit obligations by applying the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The future expected cash outflows calculated based on assumptions that include inflation and mortality are discounted to present value, using a discount rate determined at the end of each reporting period by reference to current market yields on high quality corporate bonds AA rated identified to match the currency and estimated term of the obligations.
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, future inflation, the employees age upon termination and retirement, mortality rates, future pension increases, disability incidence and health and dental care cost trends.
If actuarial experience differs from the assumptions used, the expected obligation could increase or decrease in future years.
Due to the complexity of the valuation and its long-term nature, the defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions.
Assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
As such, the valuation of the liability is highly sensitive to changes in bond rates and will also be impacted by changes in equity markets.
UK Schemes The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are mainly held in separate trustee administered funds.
The UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants in 2002.
The profile of the members of the two main UK schemes at 30 September 2015 the latest date at which full information is available is as follows: Number Active members members in employment with the Group and accruing benefits 2,216 Deferred members members no longer accruing and not yet receiving benefits 25,980 Pensioners members and dependants receiving benefits 17,469 Total members at 30 September 2015 45,665 Active members of the schemes accrue additional benefits in each year based on salaries subject to a salary cap in that year.
Employees are entitled to join a stakeholder pension scheme for earnings above the cap.
Accrued benefits are revalued up to retirement in accordance with Government indices for inflation.
A cap of 2.5% per annum applies to the revaluation of accrued benefits.
A cap of 5% per annum applies for benefits which accrued prior to March 2010.
After retirement, pensions in payment are increased each year based on the increases in the Government indices for inflation.
A cap of 5% applies to benefits in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions which accrued prior to 31 December 2005, and a cap of 2.5% applies to benefits accruing after that date.
The UK schemes are managed through trusts with independent trustees responsible for the safeguard of the interests of all members.
The trustees meet regularly with Group management to discuss the funding position and any proposed changes to the schemes.
The schemes are regulated by The Pension Regulator.
Each scheme is subject to triennial valuations, which are used to determine the future funding of the schemes by the Group including funding to repair any funding deficit.
The effective date of the most recent valuations of the main UK funds is 31 March 2015.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Notes to the statement of financial position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 161 The Group is exposed to risks through its obligation to fund the schemes.
These risks include market risk assets not performing as well as expected, inflation risk and mortality risk over the lives of the members.
The Group and the trustees of the schemes work together to reduce these risks through agreement of investment policy including the use of interest rate, inflation rate and mortality swaps.
During 2009, the Group entered into arrangements that provide coverage against mortality risk for 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment of the two largest UK schemes at that time.
The arrangement provides for reimbursement of the covered pension obligations in return for the contractual return receivable on portfolios of assets including some interest rate swaps held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The arrangement is accounted for as a longevity swap.
The pension schemes continue to hold the original assets used to fund the arrangements.
At the most recent funding valuations, the main UK funds had an aggregate funding deficit of 392m, equivalent to a funding level of 95%.
The Group and the Trustees agreed funding plans at that time to eliminate the funding deficits by 2025.
Details of the deficit contributions paid in 2014 and 2015 and that are due to be paid in 2016 under these plans are disclosed below.
The funding plans will be reviewed again following the next triennial funding valuations which will have an effective date of 31 March 2018.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2015 were 93m 2014: 93m of which 65m 2014: 64m was additional contributions in line with the plan to reduce funding deficits.
Expected contributions to the two schemes for the year ending 31 December 2016 are approximately 85m including 65m of additional contributions to reduce the deficit.
The 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the main defined benefit schemes has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK now accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder pension scheme.
m 162 Financial statements Notes to the statement of financial position RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the statement of financial position continued Non-UK schemes The Group also operates defined benefits schemes in other countries.
The most significant of these schemes are in Canada and Ireland.
The Group also provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances and benefits are generally payable for life.

For the UK the annual rate of increase in pensions shown is the rate that applies to pensions that increase at RPI subject to a cap of 5%.
For other schemes the weighted average assumption is shown.
Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
At the funding valuation in March 2015, the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the S2 base tables with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using the CMI 2015 tables with a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 28.0 2014: 27.6 years for males and 29.1 2014: 28.9 years for females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 29.3 2014: 28.7 years for males and 30.6 2014: 30.1 years for females.
Sensitivities Sensitivities for the defined benefit obligations of the two main UK schemes are shown below net of tax : Changes in assumption 2015 2014 Discount rate Increase by 0.25% 222 237 1 RPI CPI Increase by 0.25% 166 177 Mortality long-term rate Increase by 0.25% 62 70 2 Mortality assumption Reduce by 12% 187 192 Notes: 1 The impact shown is for the appropriate increase in the revaluation of deferred pensions and the increases to pensions in payment resulting from the specified increase in RPI and CPI.
2 Reducing the mortality assumption by 12% is the equivalent of increasing the life expectancy of a male aged 60 years by 1 year.

166 Financial statements Other commitments and contingencies RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Other commitments and contingencies 41 Leases The operating lease payments recognised as an expense during the year are 54m 2014: 57m.
The Group has no significant lease agreements that include contingent rent.
Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessee The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Land and buildings Other 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m One year or less 42 47 1 2 Between one and five years 131 137 1 2 After five years 122 108 295 292 2 4 Recoveries under sub tenancies 7 8 Total 288 284 2 4 Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessor The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Land and buildings 2015 2014 m m One year or less 23 21 Between one and five years 81 74 After five years 72 80 Total 176 175 42 Other commitments Capital commitments The Groups significant capital commitments in respect of property and equipment and intangible assets are detailed in the table below: 2015 2014 m m Property and equipment 53 49 Intangible assets 48 39 Total 101 88 Funding commitments to structured entities and invested assets The future commitments to structured entities are disclosed in note 28 of these financial statements.
In addition, the Group has committed to invest 147m 2014: nil in other classes of investments.
43 Other contingent liabilities In Canada the Group has purchased annuities from regulated Canadian life insurers in order to pay fixed and recurring payments to certain claimants.
This arrangement exposes the group to a credit risk that the life insurers are unable to make these payments which is mitigated by an industry compensation scheme which in that event would assume a significant majority of the remaining outstanding obligations.
The likelihood of both a Canadian regulated life insurer and the industry compensation scheme being unable to pay their obligations is considered very remote and so no provision has been recognised in respect of this risk.
The Group receives liability claims and may also become involved in actual or threatened litigation, during the ordinary course of its business operations.
The Group reviews and, in the opinion of the Directors, maintains sufficient provisions, capital and reserves in respect of such claims.
In addition, the Group has given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in relation to the disposals of its businesses and business interests to external parties.
These are kept under review and, in the opinion of the Directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Appendices RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 167 Appendices Appendix A: Events after the reporting period On 29 January 2016, the Group completed the sale of its entire 75% shareholding of Intouch Insurance RSA Russia to Joint Stock Insurance Company BLAGOSOSTOYANIE for approximately 5m in cash.
Appendix B: Other accounting policies Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls a subsidiary if the Group has all of the following: the power over the subsidiary: exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary: and the ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect its returns.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the cost of acquisition include the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration at the acquisition date and subsequent changes in the carrying value of the consideration are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For business combinations completed prior to 31 December 2009, the cost also includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition and the value of contingent consideration on settlement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the ownership interests of a subsidiary between shareholders of the Group and shareholders holding a noncontrolling interest are accounted for as transactions between equity holders of the Group.
Any difference between the fair value of the consideration given by the transferee and the carrying value of the ownership interest transferred is recognised directly in equity.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investments in associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups shares of its associates profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement and its share of comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The cumulative post acquisition movements are adjusted in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Adjustments are made, where necessary, to the accounting policies of associates to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
168 Financial statements Appendices RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Appendices continued Translation of foreign operations The results and financial position of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is not Sterling are translated into Sterling as follows: Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at closing exchange rates at the end of the period: Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates during each period: All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income within the foreign currency translation reserve.
Further information can be found in note 22.
When a foreign entity is sold, the cumulative exchange differences relating to that foreign entity are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by various share trusts of the Group and held as own shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by increasing the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, notably those related to the employee share schemes.
Hedge accounting Transactions are classified as hedging transactions when the following conditions for hedge accounting are met: There is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge: The hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cashflows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular hedging relationship: The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured: The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined to have been highly effective.
Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation Where a foreign exchange derivative is designated as a hedging instrument against a net investment in foreign operations, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
At the point at which the net investment in the foreign operation is derecognised, the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
On designation of forward foreign exchange contracts the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring the net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
For foreign exchange options the hedge designation is to hedge the value of the foreign operations at the strike price at the exercise date of the option.
Hedge of future cashflows Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument against the cashflows from a fixed interest security, the gains and losses arising from the change in fair value of the derivative are recognised initially in other comprehensive income in the cashflow hedge reserve.
This amount is adjusted to be the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative and the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cashflows of the security, both since the inception of the hedge.
The accumulated amount in the cashflow hedge reserve, is reclassified to the income statement in the period in which the hedged cashflows affect profit or loss.
Hedge of changes in fair value Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in a fair value hedge of the changes in value of a fixed interest security, the gains and losses arising from the change in fair value of the derivative are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The change in fair value of the hedged investments that are attributable to the hedged risk is transferred from the revaluation reserve to the income statement.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Appendices RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 169 Property and equipment Property, plant and equipment is comprised of Group occupied land and buildings and other equipment comprising of fixtures, fittings and other equipment including computer hardware and motor vehicles and is initially recognised at cost.
Group occupied property is stated at fair value, less subsequent depreciation for buildings.
The fair value methodology is set out in note 27.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are recognised in other comprehensive income and credited to a separate revaluation reserve within equity.
Decreases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are recognised in other comprehensive income and reduce the revaluation reserve, to the extent they offset previous revaluation increases: further decreases are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Buildings are depreciated to their residual value on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of the building: depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement except where a building has been revalued upwards, in which case the amount of the depreciation relating to the difference between the buildings revalued amount and the original cost is transferred from revaluation reserve to retained earnings.
All other plant equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset only when it is probable that the expenditure will result directly in a flow of future economic benefits to the Group, and the cost can be measured reliably.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment is as follows: Group occupied buildings normally 30 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Equipment 3-5 years The useful economic life and residual value are reviewed on an annual basis.
Where the carrying value of an asset is deemed to be greater than the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired as outlined in the significant accounting policies note.
Gains and losses on disposal are recognised based on the carrying amount of the asset.
On disposal of buildings, the associated revaluation surplus is transferred to retained earnings.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Investment property and rental income Investment property is recorded at fair value.
The fair value methodology is set out in more detail in note 27.
Unrealised gains and unrealised losses or changes are recognised in net investment income in the consolidated income statement.
Rental income from operating leases on investment property is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease.
Policy acquisition costs Policy acquisition costs incurred in acquiring insurance contracts include commissions and premium taxes directly related to the writing or renewal of insurance policies.
These acquisition costs are deducted from unearned premiums and recognised in the consolidated income statement on the same basis as the unearned premiums.
Loan capital Loan capital comprises subordinated bonds which are initially measured at the consideration received less transaction costs.
Subsequently, loan capital is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events that are more likely than not to result in an outflow of economic resources in order to settle the obligation, and the amount of that outflow can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is recognised if the Group has a possible future obligation as a result of past events, but either the amount of the expected future outflow of economic resources or the likelihood of payment cannot be reliably estimated.
170 Financial statements Appendices RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Appendices continued Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when either employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
Termination benefit expenses are recognised in the income statement at the earlier of the date when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer and the date when any related restructuring costs are recognised.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.
Own shares Own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of shares.
Other operating income Other operating income is comprised principally of: Administration fee income: is received from policyholders in order for certain changes to their policy or policyholder details within their period of cover to be made and is recognised in full on the date that the change is made: Premium policy instalment income: is received from policyholders as a finance charge on premiums paid in instalments and is recognised over the period that the instalments are made on a straight-line basis: Engineering inspection fees: are received in respect of inspection services of plant and machinery and are recognised in full in the month in which the inspection is made.
Share based payments The fair value of the employee share options and other equity settled share based payments is calculated at the grant date and recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
The vesting of share awards is dependent on service and performance conditions, as well as market conditions.
The assumption of the number of shares expected to vest is revised at the end of each reporting period, with the corresponding credit recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an option is cancelled by an employee, the full value of the option less any value previously recognised is recognised at the cancellation date.
The proceeds received by the Group upon exercise of share options, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within limits set by the Investment Association IA.
Further information on the share schemes the Group operates can be found in note 19 and in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Dividends The final dividend is recognised as a liability when approved at the Annual General Meeting.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various outlets and offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Payments made under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
