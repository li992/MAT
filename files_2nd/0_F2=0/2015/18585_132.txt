The Groups foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a net asset fair value of 61 million 115 million asset less 54 million liability.
At December 2014, the fair value was 331 million net liability 68 million asset less 399 million liability.
Following the announcement of the Novartis transaction in April 2014, GSK entered into a number of forward exchange contracts to protect the Sterling value of the net US dollar proceeds due to the Group on completion of the transaction.
At 31 December 2014, these contracts were in a loss position and resulted in a liability of 264 million and an unrealised loss of 299 million.
At maturity on 2 March 2015, these contracts were in a loss position of 319 million and resulted in a realised loss of 55 million in the year.
This loss has partly offset the gain in the Sterling value of the proceeds received by the Group on divestment of its Oncology business as a result of favourable exchange movements since the inception of the forward contracts.
The overall increase in the net asset fair value has been due to the maturity of this hedge during the year and to increased hedging of inter-company loans that are not designated as accounting hedges.
Fair value movements are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company loan balances.

Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its European Euro and Japanese Yen foreign operations as shown in the table above.
Net assets in Swiss Franc and South African Rand foreign operations were also in designated net investment hedges, although none remained outstanding at 31 December 2015.
The carrying value of bonds on page 195 includes 2,740 million 2014 4,124 million that are designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
Cash ow hedges During 2015, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which it designated as cash ow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro and US dollar denominated coupon payments relating to the Groups European and US medium term notes.
In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging uctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued in prior years.
The balance is reclassied to finance costs over the life of these bonds.

Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity Foreign currency exposures arise from the translation of financial assets and liabilities which are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts, inter-company loans and deposits, other receivables and payables and trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments hedging legal provisions and activities arising from acquisitions and disposals of assets.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to Sterling against movements in US dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December, a weakening of Sterling against these currencies, with all other variables held constant, is illustrated in the table below.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to foreign exchange risk where this risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

The table below presents the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates based on the composition of net debt as shown in Note 31 adjusting for the effects of foreign exchange derivatives that are not part of net debt but affect future foreign currency cash ows.

Interest rate sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates will affect future cash ows or the fair values of financial instruments.
The majority of debt is issued at xed interest rates and changes in the oating rates of interest do not signicantly affect the Groups net interest charge, although the majority of cash and liquid investments earn oating rates of interest.
The table below hypothetically shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US dollar and Euro variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
If the interest rates applicable to oating rate financial assets and liabilities were to have increased by 1% 100 basis points, and assuming other variables had remained constant, it is estimated that the Groups finance income for 2015 would have increased by approximately 37 million 2014 - 5 million increase.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.

The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
Contractual cash ows in respect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under noncancellable operating leases table in Note 40, Commitments.
