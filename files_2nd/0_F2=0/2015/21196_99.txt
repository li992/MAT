The capital statement also provides a reconciliation of shareholders funds to regulatory capital.
From 1 January 2016 EU-based insurance groups are no longer required to disclose their solvency position under the Insurance Groups Directive, as the regulatory framework has been replaced by the new Solvency II regime.
As such, after 31 December 2015 Aviva Group will no longer disclose its capital statement under FRS 27.
The analysis below sets out the Groups available capital resources at 31 December 2015.
2 Unallocated divisible surplus for overseas life operations is included gross of minority interest.
3 Includes goodwill and other intangibles of 116 million in joint ventures and associates.
4 Includes an adjustment for minorities except for other sources of capital that are reflected net of minority interest.
5 Includes the Provident Mutual With-Profits Fund and the Ireland With-Profits Sub-Fund.
6 Includes FPLAL WPF, FLC New WPF, FLC Old WPF, FLAS WPF and WL WPF.

Further analysis of the movement in the liabilities of the long-term business can be found in notes 40 and 41.
The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
The negative shareholders funds balance within the UK with-profits funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 2,073 million this is known as RIEESA at 31 December 2015 31 December 2014: 2,111 million held within NPSF Non-Profit Sub-Fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis, therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
The with-profits funds and the RIEESA use internal hedging to limit the impacts of equity market volatility.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 24.2 billion 2014: 22.2 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profits funds have available capital of 4.0 billion 2014: 3.9 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new nonprofit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profits business.
The capital including RIEESA is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore no further support is required by shareholders.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 20.2 billion 2014: 18.3 billion is higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
The total available capital of 24.2 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently and includes the Groups unallocated divisible surplus of overseas life operations.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profits funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the PRAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profits fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profits funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the PRAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profits funds to meet the PRA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

Realistic liabilities adjusted to eliminate the shareholders share of accrued bonuses are 48.5 billion 31 December 2014: 33.0 billion.
These realistic liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent stochastic basis.
The value of the provision included within realistic liabilities is 1.4 billion, 0.3 billion, 3.2 billion, and 0.8 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF, WPSF and FP WPF respectively 31 December 2014: 1.4 billion, 0.3 billion and 3.0 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively.
2 Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2014 was nil, 0.3 billion and 1.6 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively.
3 The support arrangement represents the reattributed estate RIEESA of 2.1 billion at 31 December 2015 31 December 2014: 2.1 billion.
4 The WPSF fund includes the Ireland With-Profits Sub-Fund IWPSF and the Provident Mutual PM Fund which have realistic assets and liabilities of 2.4 billion in total, and therefore do not contribute to the realistic inherited estate.
5 For FP WPF the realistic inherited estate is restricted to the estimated risk capital margin with excess available capital used to enhance asset shares.
For these funds it is assumed that the entire estimated realistic inherited estate is distributed to policyholders.
Under the PRA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU Directives regulatory peak and the PRA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with PRA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the PRA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the European Economic Area EEA, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the PRA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profits funds NWPSF, OWPSF, WPSF, FP WPF and Other Friends Life WPFs any available surplus held in each fund can be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above for OWPSF only to the extent support has been provided in the past.
In most cases, with-profits policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund.
In the FP WPF, shareholders are additionally entitled to 60% of surplus arising in respect of the pre-demutualisation non-profit and unitised business written in the fund excluding the investment elements.
Also, post-demutualisation policyholders are only entitled to surplus from the return on their investments: other sources of surplus are wholly owned by shareholders.
In the FPLAL WPF the surplus may only be distributed to policyholders.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund or, in FLL, the 2013 scheme in relation to support arrangements for the with-profits funds.
Under the scheme, the FP WPF and Other Friends Life WPFs are subject to support arrangements which require the Friends Life shareholder and non-profit fund to retain 0.9 billion of capital support assets.
Of this, 0.6 billion needs to be held in the form of tangible assets which could be transferred to the various Friends Life with-profits funds on a temporary basis if necessary.
These assets and related investment income would remain attributable to the shareholders as they would be returned when they are no longer required to support the capital requirements of the with-profits funds, under the tests of the 2013 scheme.
In the case of the FLC WPFs if all or part of the assets transferred were unlikely to be returned in the foreseeable future, then the relevant part of the transfer would be designated permanent.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
In several business units, Group companies and other parties jointly control certain entities: these joint venture operations may constrain managements ability to utilise the capital in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
