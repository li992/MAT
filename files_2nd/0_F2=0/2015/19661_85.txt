Explanation of transition to FRS 101 continued Notes to the reconciliation i Retirement benefit assets Under UK GAAP FRS 17, as the defined benefit scheme was a multi-employer scheme of which the Company was unable to identify its share of the defined benefit contribution plans underlying assets and liabilities, this scheme was accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, recognising only the contribution payable by the Company.
Under FRS 101 the multi-employer exemption is no longer available.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost within the Group amongst the participating companies.
Therefore under FRS 101 as the sponsoring employer the Company has recognised the full defined benefit surplus on the Balance Sheet which was not previously recognised on the individual Balance Sheet of any UK company within the Group.
The impact has been to increase fixed assets at 1 January 2014 by 7.2m and at 31 December 2014 by 3.6m.
As prescribed under FRS 101 any actuarial gains and losses are recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In 2014 the defined benefit surplus decreased by 3.6m of which 3.7m related to actuarial losses, 0.3m net interest income and 0.2m scheme administrative costs.
ii Deferred tax assets Under UK GAAP, a deferred tax asset is recognised in relation to share options outstanding at the balance sheet date, based on the lower of the cumulative accounting charge and the total expected future tax deductions.
Under FRS 101, a deferred tax asset is recognised on the total expected future tax deductions.
As a result the deferred tax asset and profit and loss account reserves have increased by 0.7m to recognise the higher deferred tax asset on the Company Balance Sheet as at the transition date.
In addition, at 31 December 2014 as a result of the share option charges during 2014, an adjustment is required to reduce the deferred tax asset from 1.1m to 0.5m, reducing profit and loss account reserves by 0.6m giving an overall transitional adjustment for 2014 of 0.1m.
iii Deferred tax liability A deferred tax liability of 1.4m has been recognised at the transition date on the retirement benefit scheme asset which has been brought onto the Balance Sheet under FRS 101.
This results in a reduction in the profit and loss account reserve by 1.4m.
The reduction in the pension scheme asset during 2014, as described above, has given rise to a reduction in the corresponding deferred tax liability from 1.4m to 0.7m and has increased the profit and loss account reserve by 0.7m.
iv Profit and loss account reserve Under FRS 101 the Company is required to account for foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency loans used to hedge investments through the Profit and Loss Account.
Under UK GAAP, using net investment hedging such gains and losses were recorded directly to reserves.
As a result the profit for 2014 has increased by 9.3m on transition to FRS 101 which represents the foreign exchange gains that were recorded directly to reserves under UK GAAP.
The profit and loss account reserve does not differ as the exchange gains were a line item in the profit and loss account reserves reconciliation under UK GAAP.
As described above, under FRS 101 there are adjustments required to the profit and loss account reserve in relation to the recognition of the retirement benefit assets, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
Reconciliation of profit for 2014 In accordance with the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own Profit and Loss Account.
As a result of the adjustments noted above, there has been no impact on the profit and loss account reserve: however, the transition to FRS 101 has increased the profit after tax for 2014 by 9.4m.
This relates to the reclassification of foreign exchange gains to the Profit and Loss Account of 9.3m and 0.1m relating to the net pension interest income.
