S TRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 171 171 Notes to the Company Financial Statements I.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Basis of preparation The Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101: Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these Financial Statements the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and sets out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In the transition to FRS 101 the Company has applied IFRS 1: First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101.
An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company is provided in note XX.
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period.
The following exemptions have been taken in these Financial Statements: investments in subsidiaries on transition to FRS 101, investments in subsidiaries are measured at deemed cost which, in relation to the Companys investments in Centrica Holdings Limited, Centrica Trading Limited and Centrica Beta Holdings Limited is the previous UK GAAP carrying value of the investment.
As the Company is adopting IFRS for its separate Financial Statements later than it adopted IFRS for its consolidated Group Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities in these Financial Statements have been measured at the same amounts as in those consolidated Group Financial Statements.
In these Financial Statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for tangible fixed assets and intangible assets: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: and the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
The Company has early adopted the following amendments to FRS 101 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 in these Financial Statements: presentation of IAS format Financial Statements: and exemption from the presentation of a third balance sheet being the opening balance sheet of the Company at the date of application of FRS 101.
Additionally, no Income Statement or Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented for the Company as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 section 408.
The Company profit after tax for the year was 303 million 2014: 884 million.
As the consolidated Group Financial Statements of Centrica plc, which are available from the registered office, include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2: Share-based payment in respect of Group settled share-based payments: and certain disclosures required by IFRS 13: Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7: Financial instruments: disclosures.
Measurement convention The Company Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities, which are stated at their fair values: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale, and the assets of defined benefit pension schemes.
The liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes are measured at the projected unit method of valuation.
These Financial Statements are rounded at the nearest million pounds sterling.
Unless required or permitted by an IFRS, assets and liabilities or income and expenses, are not offset.
Going concern The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, as described in the Directors Report and note 24 b of the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out in note 3 of the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
The key accounting judgement of the Company is the carrying value of its investments in subsidiary undertakings and receivables from these undertakings.
The Company does not deem its investments in subsidiary undertakings to be impaired and supports this judgement through its impairment review process as detailed below.
This impairment review process identified that some receivables from Group undertakings were not fully recoverable and accordingly a bad debt provision of 262 million 2014: 673 million was recognised against receivables during the year.
In addition, debt waivers totalling 25 million 2014: nil occurred during the year.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Key sources of estimation uncertainty include: the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as a result of the use of valuation techniques, in addition to published price quotations in active markets, to determine these values: and the allocation of the Companys share of pension scheme surplus deficit, as detailed further within the accounting policies section of these Financial Statements.
New standards effective during the year The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements and in preparing the opening FRS 101 Balance Sheet at 1 January 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101 refer to note XX.
Employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments as detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 79 and in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The issue of share incentives by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions.
When these costs are recharged to the subsidiary undertaking, the investment balance is reduced accordingly.
Fair value is measured using methods detailed in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Foreign currencies The Companys functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities and transactions are taken to the Income Statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment PP&E is held at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent expenditure in respect of items of PP&E such as the replacement of major parts, major inspections or overhauls, are capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset where it is probable that future economic benefits will arise as a result of the expenditure and the cost can be reliably measured.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred.
PP&E is depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.
Depreciation of assets under construction commences when the asset is operational.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of purchased application software, for example investments in customer relationship management and billing systems, includes contractors charges, materials, directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.
Amortisation of assets under construction commences when the asset is operational.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries shares are held at cost in accordance with IAS 27: Separate financial statements, less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Impairment The Companys accounting policies in respect of impairment of PP&E, intangible assets and financial assets are consistent with those of the Group.
The carrying values of investments in subsidiary undertakings are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an investment in a subsidiary undertaking is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Receivables from Group undertakings are compared to their recoverable amount which is also assessed using the same estimated discounted future cash flow for each undertaking as described above.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE COMPANY Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Pensions and other post employment benefits The Companys employees participate in a number of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
The total Group cost of providing benefits under defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each of the Groups schemes under the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
The key assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based on the Groups best estimate of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post employment benefits, on which further detail is provided in note 22 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
The Companys share of the total Group surplus or deficit at the end of the reporting period for each scheme is calculated in proportion to the Companys share of ordinary employer contributions in to that scheme during the year: ordinary employer contributions are determined by the pensionable pay of the Companys employees within the scheme and the cash contribution rates set by the scheme trustees.
Current service cost is calculated with reference to the pensionable pay of the Companys employees.
The Companys share of the total Group interest on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets and actuarial gains or losses is calculated in proportion to ordinary employer contributions in the prior accounting period.
Changes in the surplus or deficit arising as a result of the changes in the Companys share of total ordinary employer contributions are also treated as actuarial gains or losses.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Companys assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
Deferred tax assets that are not eligible for offset against deferred tax liabilities are recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Financial instruments The Companys accounting policies for financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group as disclosed in note S2 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
The Companys financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and are described in the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 38 to 42 and in note S3 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements.
Presentation of derivative financial instruments In line with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments, the Company has classified those derivatives held for the purpose of treasury management as current or non-current, based on expected settlement dates.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event that can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation.

OPENING BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING FRS 101 FROM UK GAAP Notes to the reconciliation of equity a Under FRS 101, only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware should be included as PP&E.
All other computer software should be recorded as an intangible asset.
The impact at transition was to reclassify 28 million of application software classified as PP&E under UK GAAP to intangible assets.
b Under FRS 101, the Companys investment of 189 million in the form of a long-term loan to certain joint ventures of the Group has been designated a non-current loan and receivable balance.
The Company previously recognised this asset as an investment, however on transition, the investment is accounted for in accordance with IAS 39: Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Under FRS 101, the non-current portion of assets previously shown as current under UK GAAP have now been reclassified as non-current trade and other receivables 15 million.
c As part of the transition to FRS 101, the Company reviewed its accounting policies and practices with respect to intercompany transactions.
As a result, certain adjustments have been made to intercompany balances to reflect the expected nature in which they will be settled, to improve the clarity for the users of the Financial Statements in light of guidance in IAS 32: Financial instruments: presentation.
d As part of the FRS 101 transition, financial derivative instruments netted within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables previously named as debtors and other creditors under UK GAAP have been disclosed separately on a gross basis.
Deferred tax is also now separately disclosed.
e As part of the FRS 101 transition, a deferred tax asset of 6 million associated with the Companys defined benefit pension scheme and previously offset against the scheme obligation has been presented separately in the Balance Sheet under FRS 101.
Under FRS 101, deferred tax on share-based payments is calculated on the difference between the intrinsic value of shares expected to vest compared with the expected tax deduction based on the year end share price.
On transition, this resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of 1 million being recognised.
f As part of the FRS 101 transition, a separate available-for-sale reserve and actuarial gains and losses reserve have been presented in Other equity.
Under UK GAAP these items were recognised within retained earnings.
Reconciliation of profit Under UK GAAP, the Company was not required to, and did not, present a Statement of Comprehensive Income.
There are two adjusting items on transition to FRS 101: the first relates to the application of IAS 19 to the calculation of finance income and expense on the Companys defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Under UK GAAP, FRS 17 required the calculation of a gross finance income and expense on scheme assets and liabilities through the application of an expected asset rate of return and discount rate respectively.
IAS 19 prohibits the use of a separate expected rate of return on scheme assets and requires application of the discount rate to the net scheme asset or liability.
This has the impact of reducing the net financing income in relation to pension schemes and the impact in the year of transition increases the financing charge by 2 million: and under IAS 12: Income taxes, the deferred tax arising on share-based payments is recalculated resulting in an increase in the deferred tax charge of 1 million.
Explanation of material adjustments to the Cash Flow Statement for 31 December 2014 Under UK GAAP and FRS 101, the Company is not required to, and did not, prepare a Cash Flow Statement.
Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2014 The net assets as at 1 January 2014 under UK GAAP were 3,127 million and following transition to FRS 101 were adjusted to 3,136 million.
The difference relates to differences in deferred tax balances calculated under IAS 12.
All other FRS 101 adjustments upon transition have a nil impact on the total equity position.
The remaining adjustments relate to balance sheet reclassifications which are described above.
