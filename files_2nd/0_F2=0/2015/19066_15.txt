Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 100 Consolidated financial Company financial Overview Strategic report Corporate governance statements and notes statements and notes Additional information 9 Goodwill 2015 2014 Note $000 $000 Cost and net book amount At 1 May 308,182 284,661 Hindsight adjustment 39 213 Acquisitions 39 2,113,350 23,521 At 30 April 2,421,745 308,182 A segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: North America 201,938 202,066 International 103,018 102,677 Asia Pacific and Japan 3,439 3,439 TAG 2,113,350 At 30 April 2,421,745 308,182 The hindsight period adjustments relate to transactions that occurred within 12 months of the acquisition date and are attributable to OpenFusion CORBA assets increase of $342,000 and AccuRev decrease of $129,000, both acquired during the year ended 30 April 2014 note 39.
The additions to goodwill in the year relate to the acquisition of TAG note 39.
Of the additions to goodwill, there is no amount that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash-generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has three CGUs being the three geographical segments North America, International and Asia Pacific and Japan for the Base Micro Focus business and one CGU for TAG where this business was run as one business with management incentivized on the Group performance.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount: where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
The recoverable amounts of the three heritage Micro Focus CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations and TAG is based on the fair value less cost of sales method as used when acquiring the business on 20 November 2014 since the acquired company has been held for less than six months and trading has been slightly better than anticipated at the time of acquisition.
The determination of whether or not the goodwill of the three regional CGUs has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
The cash flow projections in the three following financial years reflect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to each CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the consolidated statement of financial position date and risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was: 2015 2014 North America 14% 14% International 11% 11% Asia Pacific and Japan 13% 13% Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 101 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2015 continued 9 Goodwill continued Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The long-term EBITDA margin applied to each CGU is 44.0% 2014: 44.0%.
The VIU calculations are based on 14 years projections and then a terminal value calculation.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows The long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 2.0% 2014: 2.0%.
The long-term growth rate is applied consistently across all CGUs as: The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics: Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs: and Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2014: nil.
As the VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating margin, the directors are of the opinion that it would take a systematic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% 2014: 4.0% in the absolute value of long-term operating margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is flexible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more significant changes.
If the long-term margins used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4.0% 2014: 4.0% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not be any impairment charge.
The Group based its estimate for the long-term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC had the acquisition of TAG not taken place using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The directors have assessed that a 2.0% 2014: 2.0% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible and this would represent a 17.7% 2014: 23.2% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash flows of all of the three regional CGUs were 2.0% 2014: 2.0% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that 1.0% 2014: 1.0% change is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1.0% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognized any goodwill impairment charge.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across all CGUs combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA for each of the three regional CGUs is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past Adjusted EBITDA margins are not indicative of future Adjusted EBITDA margins.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA margin applied to each CGU is 44.0% 2014: 44.0%.
The medium-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be 4% for each CGU 2014: 4.0%.
The fair value of net liabilities of TAG acquisition as at 20 November 2014 were $727.1m and the consideration paid which was believed on acquisition to be the fair value of the company was $1,386.2m generating a goodwill value of $2,113.4m.
Since acquisition TAG trading has been slightly stronger than expected and there is no reason to believe that there has been any reduction in the value of TAG.
Accordingly no impairment is considered necessary.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see Group accounting policy H d. Expenditure totaling $21.2m 2014: $37.2m was made in the year, including $19.5m in respect of development costs and $1.7m of purchased software.
The acquisition of TAG resulted in an addition of $1,139.4m to purchased intangibles and purchased software note 39.
Impairment charges of $12.6m 2014: $Nil, of which $11.6m was reported within exceptional items note 3, were made in respect of some TAG acquired intangibles no longer to be utilized by the Group and some Borland development costs previously capitalized in the year ended 30 April 2014, to ensure that the carrying value of these assets reflects the revised recoverable amount.
At 30 April 2015, the unamortized lives of technology assets were in the range of two to six years and for customer relationships in the range of one to seven years.
Amortization of $51.2m 2014: $9.2m is included in selling and distribution costs, $55.7m 2014: $28.2m is included in research and development expense and $2.2m 2014: $0.6m is included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables on a customer by customer basis.
The Group considers that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30April 2015 and 2014, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2015, trade receivables of $34.1m 2014: $16.3m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.

The principal funds are those in the US, UK and Germany.
These were funded schemes of the defined contribution type.
Outside of these territories, the schemes are also of the defined contribution type, except for France and Japan which is a defined benefit scheme, but which has few members and therefore is not significant to the Group.
Pension costs for defined contributions schemes are as follows: 2015 2014 $000 $000 Defined contribution schemes note 35 9,815 4,870 b Defined benefit 2015 2014 $000 $000 Within Non-current assets: Long-term pension assets 14,076 Within Non-current liabilities: Retirement benefit obligations 32,742 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 112 Consolidated financial Company financial Overview Strategic report Corporate governance statements and notes statements and notes Additional information 25 Pension commitments continued The acquisition of TAG, on 20 November 2014, added three defined benefit plans in Germany under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
All of the plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life in the case of retirement, disability and death.
The level of benefits provided depends not only on the final salary but also on members length of service, social security ceiling and other factors.
Final pension entitlements are calculated by our Actuary in Swiss Life.
They also complete calculations in cases of death in service and disability.
There is no requirement for the appointment of Trustees in Germany.
The schemes are administered locally with the assistance of German pension experts.
All three plans were closed for new membership.
The retirement benefit obligation on the date of acquisition was $31.3m note 39.
The following amounts have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the German defined benefit pension arrangements: 2015 $000 Current service charge 330 Charge to operating profit 330 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 320 Interest on pension scheme assets 59 Charge to finance costs 261 Total charge to Consolidated Income Statement 591 The contributions for the year ended 30 April 2016 are expected to be broadly in line with the current year.
The following amounts have been recognized as movements in equity: 2015 $000 Actuarial return on assets excluding amounts included in interest income 229 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities: Demographic Financial 4,565 Experience 140 4,425 Exchange rate movement Movement in the year 4,196 The key assumptions used for the German scheme were: 2015 Rate of increase in final pensionable salary 2.60% Rate of increase in pension payments 2.00% Discount rate 1.45% Inflation 2.00% The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the German scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to market conditions.
If the discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligation would be expected to increase by $5.2m and if it was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to decrease by $4.4m.
If the inflation assumption was 0.25% lower, the obligations would be expected to decrease by $1.4m and if it was 0.25% higher, they would be expected to increase by $1.4m.
The mortality assumptions for the German scheme are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in the territory, specifically German pension table Richttafeln 2005 G by Prof. Dr Klaus Heubeck.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2015 continued 25 Pension commitments continued These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65: 2015 Retiring at age 65 at the end of the reporting year: Male 19 Female 23 Retiring 15 years after the end of the reporting year: Male 19 Female 24 The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the German schemes are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption.
If there was an increase of one year to this assumption the obligation would be expected to increase by $1.1m 2.9%.
The provision included in the Consolidated statement of financial position arising from obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes is as follows: 20 November 2014 30 April 2015 on acquisition $000 $000 Present value of funded obligations 38,224 37,128 Fair value of plan assets 5,482 5,871 32,742 31,257 The net present value of the defined benefit obligation has moved as follows: 2015 $000 At 1 May 2014 Acquisition of TAG 37,128 Current service cost 330 Benefits paid 68 Interest cost 320 Remeasurements actuarial losses: Demographic Financial 4,565 Experience 140 Foreign currency exchange changes 3,911 At 30 April 2015 38,224 The fair value of scheme assets has moved as follows: 2015 $000 At 1 May 2014 Acquisition of TAG 5,871 Interest income 59 Remeasurements actuarial return on assets excluding amounts included in interest income 229 Contributions by plan participants 81 Benefits paid 16 Other transfer to non-plan assets 128 Foreign currency exchange changes 614 At 30 April 2015 5,482 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 114 Consolidated financial Company financial Overview Strategic report Corporate governance statements and notes statements and notes Additional information 25 Pension commitments continued None of the plan assets are represented by financial instruments of the Group.
None of the plan assets are occupied or used by the Group.
The plan assets comprise of re-insurance with guaranteed interest rates.
The majority of the plan assets have a guaranteed interest rate of 4.0%, with the remaining at 3.25% or 2.75%.
Through its defined benefit schemes the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the pledged and unpledged re-insurance holdings.
Inflation Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
There is a cap on the level of inflationary increase on one of the plans which protects the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the plan assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plan liabilities.
In the case of the defined benefit plans, the Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset liability matching ALM that has been developed by the Company to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the pension schemes.
In addition to the plan assets outlined above, the Company had re-insurance assets valued at $14.1m at 30April, 2015.
These assets are designated to fund the pension obligation and do not qualify as plan assets as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Company.
Within this framework the Companys objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in re-insurances that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.
Sensitivities The table below provides information on the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions.
The table shows the impact of changes to each assumption in isolation, although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation.
These sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as used for the main calculations.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 25 years.
Change in defined Change in benefit assumption obligation Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.50% 13.5% Price inflation 0.25% 3.5% Salary growth rate 0.50% 1.8% An increase of one year in the assumed life expectancy for both males and females would increase the defined benefit obligation by 2.9%.

27 Financial instruments Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2015 was: 2015 2014 $000 $000 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments note 17 197,804 86,499 Cash and cash equivalents note 18 241,324 32,800 Total 439,128 129,299 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2015 continued 27 Financial instruments continued Risk management The Groups treasury function aims to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available as and when required, and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not typically engage in speculative trading in financial instruments.
The treasury functions policies and procedures are reviewed and monitored by the audit committee and are subject to internal audit review.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups currency exposures comprise those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as well as gains and losses on consolidation which go to reserves.
Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved and the Groups investment in net assets in currencies other than US$.
Note 3 shows the impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of foreign exchange gains in the year 2014: loss.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal exposures in relation to market risks are the changes in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the Euro and to changes in US LIBOR interest rates.
The table below illustrates the sensitivities of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the consolidated statement of financial position date.
The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the consolidated statement of financial position date.

The strategy is designed to maximize shareholder return over the long-term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium-term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The only financial covenant affecting the Groups new committed credit facilities is an aggregate net leverage covenant which is applicable in circumstances where more than 35% of the Revolving Facility is outstanding at a fiscal quarter end.

30 Return of Value to shareholders In December 2014 the Company completed a Return of Value to shareholders amounting to 83.9m $131.6m in cash 60 pence per share, equivalent to 94.02 cents per share, by way of a B and C share scheme, which gave shareholders other than certain overseas shareholders a choice between receiving the cash in the form of income or capital.
The Return of Value was accompanied by a 0.9285 share consolidation to maintain broad comparability of the share price and return per share of the ordinary shares before and after the creation of the B and C Shares.
As part of the corporate entity restructuring resulting from the acquisition a merger reserve was created of approximately $1.4bn, which is expected to become a distributable reserve in future periods.
This creates flexibility for future Returns of Value once Net Debt to Facility EBITDA is below 2.5 times.
As at December 2014 this was the Groups 4th Return of Value to shareholders and this brings the total amount returned to shareholders since 25 March 2011 through share buy-backs, Returns of Value and ordinary dividends to 554.4m which represents 87.3% of the Market Capitalization at that time.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 120 Consolidated financial Company financial Overview Strategic report Corporate governance statements and notes statements and notes Additional information 30 Return of Value to shareholders continued During the year ended 30 April 2014, the Group announced a Return of Value to shareholders of 60 pence per ordinary share by way of a D share scheme, which gave shareholders other than certain overseas shareholders a choice between receiving cash in the form of income or capital.
The Return of Value was approved by shareholders on 26 September 2013.
The Group entered into a forward exchange contract to protect the Company from any foreign exchange movement and so the resulting payment to shareholders of $144.7m was offset by a gain of $4.5m and costs of $0.6m on the foreign exchange forward contract such that the cost to the Company of the Return of Value was $140.2m excluding transaction costs.
The Return of Value was accompanied by a 12 for 13 share consolidation to maintain broad comparability of the share price and return per share of the ordinary shares before and after the creation of the D Shares.

This increase in share capital created a merger reserve deficit of $27.1m.
2 In January 2012 a Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $129.0m in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $0.6m.
As a result of this a capital redemption reserve was created following the redemption of the B Shares.
In November 2012 a further Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $128.2m in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $2.4m.
In the year ended 30 April 2014 a further $47,079,000 was added to the capital redemption reserve following the redemption of the B Shares.
3 On 20 November 2014 the TAG acquisition was completed note 39.
As a result of this a merger reserve was created of $1,372.7m.
The acquisition of TAG was structured by way of a share for share exchange: this transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued.
The Company chose to record its investment in TAG at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable i. e. equal to the difference between the fair value of TAG and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealized on the basis it was represented by the investment in TAG, which is not considered to represent qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 10 Guidance on the determination of realized profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of TAG, the Companys investment in TAG was transferred to another Group company in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent this loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized.
4 The merger reserve is an unrealized profit until it can be realized by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
$130.0m of the intercompany loan is expected to be settled in qualifying consideration during the year to 30 April 2016 and as such an equivalent proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized and therefore has been transferred to the profit and loss account.
5 In December 2014 a Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $131.6m in cash note 30.

Share-based payments The Group has various equity-settled share-based compensation plans, details of which are provided below.
a Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which point 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a combination of both.
Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum, 25% of awards will vest, with full vesting achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum.
Where the award is subject to ASR, the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report on pages 48 to 69.

Grants can be made to no more than 15 people within 18 months of the completion date.
ASGs are nil cost options over ordinary shares.
The number of ordinary shares subject to the ASGs will be a maximum of 2.5% of the Enlarged Share Capital.
The ASGs will become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition, on the third anniversary of the date of Completion or 1 November 2017, whichever is earlier the vesting date and will remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of Completion.
The performance condition is that the percentage of ordinary shares subject to the ASG which may be acquired on exercise on or after the vesting date is as follows: i 0 % if the Shareholder Return Percentage as defined below is 50% or less: ii 100% if the Shareholder Return Percentage is 100% or more: and iii a percentage determined on a straight-line basis between i and ii above.
The Shareholder Return Percentage will be calculated by deducting 819.4 pence per share the Reference Price, being the average of the 20 days before 3 June 2014 being the date of the heads of agreement relating to the proposed combination of Micro Focus and Attachmate between Micro Focus, Wizard, Golden Gate Capital and Francisco Partners Management LP, from the sum of the Vesting Price calculated as the average closing share price over the period of 20 days ending on the day prior to the vesting date plus the total of all dividends per share between Completion and the vesting date.
This will be divided by the Reference Price, multiplying the resulting figure by 100 to obtain the Shareholder Return Percentage.

In addition to this $0.7m 2014: $nil was charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of National Insurance on these share options.
