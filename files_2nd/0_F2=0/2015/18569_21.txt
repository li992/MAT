76 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies General information Galliford Try plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated, listed and domiciled in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is Galliford Try plc, Cowley Business Park, Cowley, Uxbridge, UB8 2AL.
Galliford Try is a housebuilding and construction group the Group.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The amounts stated are denominated in millions m. Basis of accounting These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU adopted International Accounting Standards IASs, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available for sale investments, retirement benefit obligations, share-based payments and financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group has consistently applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS IC, and endorsed by the EU, relevant to its operations and effective on 1 July 2014.
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 to not present the Parent Company income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
The profit for the Parent Company for the year was 103.4 million 2014:loss 3.6 million.
New amendments to standards that became mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2014 are listed below.
The new amendments had no significant impact on the Groups results other than certain revised disclosures.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and joint ventures Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 & 12 on transition guidance Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 & IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities Amendment to IAS 32 on Financial instruments: asset and liability offsetting Amendment to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement IFRS IC 21 Levies New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective or yet to be endorsed by the EU are as follows: IFRS 9 Financial instruments and the amendment on general hedge accounting effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 14 Regulatory deferral accounts effective 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective 1 January 2017 Amendment to IFRS 11 Joint arrangements on acquisition of an interest in a joint operation effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IAS 19 Employee benefits on defined benefit plans effective 1 February 2015 Amendment to IAS 27 Separate financial statements on equity accounting effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IFRS 9 Financial instruments on general hedge accounting effective 1 January 2018 Amendment to IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures effective1January 2016 Other changes recommended in Annual Improvements 2012, Annual Improvements 2013 and Annual Improvements 2014 effectivefrom 1 January 2015 IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Groups accounting for its financial assets.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact.
However, initial indications are that it may affect the Groups accounting for its available for sale financial assets, as IFRS 9 only permits the recognition of fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income if they relate to equity or certain debt investments that are not held for trading.
Fair value gains and losses on available for sale debt investments, for example, will therefore have to be recognised directly in profit or loss.
The Group is currently reviewing the impact of IFRS 15 to determine both the accounting and disclosure implications.
The Group has yet to assess the full impact of the remainder of these new standards and amendments.
Initial indications are that they will not significantly impact the financial statements of the Group.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financials 77 1 Accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects onlythat period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Material estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regards to establishing the following policies: i Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The determination of the value of any impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires an estimation of the value in use of the Cash Generating Units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from these CGUs, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Details of the goodwill impairment review calculations and sensitivity analysis performed are included in note 10. ii Estimation of costs to complete and contract provisions In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period, the Group has to allocate total costs of the developments and construction contracts between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period.
The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation, as does the assessment of a developments valuation.
However, Group management has established internal controls toreview and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual contract basis.
iii Retirement benefit obligation valuations In determining the valuation of defined benefit schemes assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: inflation rate: life expectancy: discount rate: and salary and pension growth rates.
The Group is exposed to risks through its defined benefit schemes if actual experience differs to the assumptions used and through volatility in the plan assets.
Details of the assumptions used, and associated sensitivities, are included in note 30. iv Shared equity receivables Shared equity receivables largely have variable repayment dates and amounts, and are provided as part of the sales transaction and secured by a second legal charge on the related property.
They are stated at fair value as described in note 14.
In determining the fair value, the key assumptions, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group are: date of final repayment of the receivable: house price inflation: and discount rate.
Details of the sensitivity analysis carried out in respect of the shared equity receivables are set out in note 25.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Galliford Try plc, its subsidiary undertakings and the Groups share of the results of joint ventures.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The exposure or right to variable returns from its involvement with an investee, and the ability to influence those returns, are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed to the income statement.
The identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
In addition to total performance measures, the Group discloses additional information including profit from operations and, if applicable, performance before exceptional items and earnings per share before exceptional items.
The Group believes that this additional information provides useful information on underlying trends.
This additional information is not defined under IFRS, and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.
Exceptional items Material non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed in the income statement as exceptional items.
Examples of items which may give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, investments and property, plant and equipment, cost of restructuring and reorganisation of businesses, asset impairments, and pension fund settlements and curtailments.
The Group also classifies certain inventory provision reversals as exceptional to the extent that they relateto provisions previously recognised as exceptional losses.
Segmental reporting Segmental reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments, which are the primary basis of segmental reporting.
The business segmental reporting reflects the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Revenue and profit Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of rebates, discounts and value added tax.
Sales within the Group are eliminated.
Revenue also includes the Groups proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations and the disposal of equity investments by our PPP Investments business.
Revenue and profit are recognised as follows: i Housebuilding and land sales Revenue from private housing sales is recognised at legal completion, net of incentives.
Revenue from land sales is recognised on the unconditional exchange of contracts.
Profit is recognised on a site by site basis by reference to the expected result of each site.
Contracting development sales for affordable housing are accounted for as construction contracts.
ii Facilities management contracts Revenue is recognised on an accruals basis once the service has been performed, with reference to value provided to the customer.
Profit is recognised by reference to the specific costs incurred relating to the service provided.
iii Construction contracts Revenue comprises the value of construction executed during the year and contracting development sales for affordable housing.
The results for the year include adjustments for the outcome of contracts, including jointly controlled operations, executed in both thecurrent and preceding years.
a Fixed price contracts Revenue is recognised based upon an internal assessment of the value of works carried out.
This assessment is arrived at after due consideration of the performance against the programme of works, measurement of the works, detailed evaluation of the costs incurred and comparison to external certification of the work performed.
The amount of profit to be recognised is calculated based on the proportion that costs to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete.
Profit is not recognised in the income statement until the outcome of the contract is reasonably certain.
Adjustments arise from claims by customers or third parties in respect of work carried out, and claims and variations on customers or third parties for variations on the original contract.
Provision for claims against the Group is made as soon as it is believed that a liability will arise, but claims and variations made by the Group are not recognised in the income statement until the outcome is capable of being reliably measured.
Provision will be made against any potential loss as soon as it is identified.
b Cost plus contracts Revenue is recognised based upon costs incurred to date plus any agreed fee.
Where contracts include a target price consideration is given to the impact on revenue of the mechanism for distributing any savings or additional costs compared to the target price.
Any revenue over and above the target price is recognised once the outcome is virtually certain.
Profitis recognised on a constant margin throughout the life of the contract.
Provision will be made against any potential loss assoonas it is identified.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts and payments on account on construction contracts are calculated as cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses and cash received to date and are included in receivables or payables as appropriate.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financials 79 1 Accounting policies continued Housing grants and government funding Grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received.
The grants are recognised in the income statement over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis.
Interest bearing loans received from the government, for example under the Homes & Communities Agency HCA programmes, arerecorded at proceeds plus accrued interest and reported within Financial Liabilities Borrowings.
Grants and government funding received by the Group in the years to 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 include direct capital grant funding awards under the HCAs Affordable Homes Programme: Infrastructure loan finance under the Large Sites Infrastructure Fund: and equity loans provided to house buyers under the Help to Buy home ownership initiative.
Bid costs for PFI PPP contracts Bid costs relating to PFI PPP projects are not carried in the balance sheet as recoverable until the Group has been appointed preferred bidder or has received an indemnity in respect of the investment or costs, and regards recoverability of the costs as virtually certain.
Costs that are carried on the balance sheet are included within amounts recoverable on construction contracts, within trade and otherreceivables.
Rent receivable Rental income represents income obtained from the rental of properties and is credited to revenue within the income statement onastraight-line basis over the period of the operating lease.
Interest income and expense Interest income and expense is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Income tax Current income tax is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation recorded in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheetdate.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes with the exception of the initial recognition of goodwill arising on an acquisition.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where thetiming of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will notreverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right tooffset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited through the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited through the statement of comprehensive income or to equity, when it is charged or credited there.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event, by considering the net present value of future cash flows.
For purposes of testing for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been restated.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that areexpected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 80 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets include brands, customer contracts and customer relationships acquired on acquisition of subsidiary companies, and computer software developed by the Group.
The intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is atriggering event.
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Cost is determined at the time ofacquisition as being directly attributable costs or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation methodology.
Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods: a Brand on a straight-line basis over four to 10 years.
b Customer contracts in line with expected profit generation, varying from one to nine years.
c Customer relationships on a straight-line basis over three years.
d Computer software once the software is fully operational, amortisation is on a straight-line basis over up to 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that isdirectly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Land and buildings comprise mainly offices.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of each asset to estimated residual value over its expected useful life.
The annual rates of depreciation, applied on a straight-line basis, are as follows: Freehold buildings 2% on cost On cost or reducing balance: Plant and machinery 15% to 33% Fixtures and fittings 10% to 33% In addition to systematic depreciation the book value of property, plant and equipment would be written down to estimated recoverable amount should any impairment in the respective carrying values be identified.
The asset residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is expensed as incurred on an accruals basis.
Joint ventures and joint operations The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint ventures or joint operations, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control withthirdparties and these parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
The Groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method.
Under this method the Groups share of profits less losses after taxation of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where the share of losses exceeds the Groups interest in the entity and there is no obligation to fund these losses, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued.
Future profits are not recognised until unrecognised losses are extinguished.
Unrealised gains on transactions with the Groups joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in thejoint venture.
Accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed on consolidation where necessary, to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
Where joint ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Groups, results andnet assets are based upon unaudited accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement that the Group undertakes with third parties whereby those parties have rights to the assets and obligations of the arrangement.
The Group accounts for joint operations by recognising its share of profits and losses in the consolidated income statement.
The Group recognises its share of associated assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financials 81 1 Accounting policies continued Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the assets within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
On initial recognition the asset is recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Available for sale financial assets are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly inother comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or losspreviously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
The Group operates schemes under which part of the agreed sales price for a residential property can be deferred for up to 25 years.
The fair value of these assets is calculated by taking into account forecast inflation in property prices and discounting back to present value using the effective interest rate.
Provision is also made for estimated default to arrive at the initial fair value.
The unwinding of thediscount included on initial recognition at fair value is recognised as finance income in the year.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories and developments Inventories and developments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, including direct costs and directly attributable overheads, and net realisable value.
On initial recognition, land is included within developments at its fair value, which is its cost to the Group.
Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised which isgenerally after the exchange of conditional contracts once it is virtually certain the contract will be completed.
Where a development is in progress net realisable value is assessed by considering the expected future revenues and the total coststo complete the development, including direct costs and directly attributable overheads.
To the extent that the Group anticipates selling a development in its current state, then net realisable value is taken as its open market value at the balance sheet date less anyanticipated selling costs.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments typically more than 30 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within cost of sales.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the impairment provision for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries ofamounts previously written off are credited against cost of sales in the income statement.
Short-term trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their amortised cost, as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are also included, as they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Bank deposits with an original term of more than three months are classified as short-term deposits where the cash can be withdrawn on demand and the penalty for early withdrawal is not significant.
Cash held in escrow accounts is classified as a short-term deposit where the escrow agreement allows the balance to be converted to cash, if replaced by a bond repayable on demand.
Bank and other borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are originally recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Suchborrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, with the difference between initial fair value and redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period to redemption.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement, using the effective interest rate method.
Refinancing costs associated with new borrowing arrangements are included within the borrowing amount and amortised over the period of the loan.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 82 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate and subsequently held at amortised cost.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate.
Changes in estimates of the final payment due are taken to developments land and, in due course, to cost ofsales in the income statement.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using the pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, theGroup does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, comprising interest rate swaps, are measured at fair value.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value is recognised directly in reserves.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss.
Any gains or losses relating to an ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are initially accounted for and measured at fair value at the point the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is taken totheincome statement.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken totheincome statement.
Retirement benefit obligations For defined contribution schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unitmethod.
The retirement benefit asset obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess deficit of the fair value of the schemes assets over the present value of scheme liabilities, with a net asset recognised to the extent that the employer can gain economic benefit as set out in the requirements of IFRS IC 14.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows, using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which theyoccur, in the statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses arising on curtailment and settlements are taken to the incomestatement as incurred.
Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan Own shares held by the Galliford Try Employee Share Trust the Trust are shown, at cost less any permanent diminution in value, as adeduction from retained earnings.
The charge made to the income statement for employee share awards and options is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, spread over the performance period.
Where such shares subsequently vest to the employees under the terms of the Groups share option schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in equity.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financials 83 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions such as growth in earnings per share.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number ofoptions that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
Dividend policy Final dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period inwhich the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Equity instruments Equity instruments, such as ordinary share capital, issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Group held by the Trust are deducted from total equity.
Investments in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the Companys balance sheet at cost less any impairment.
The directors review the investments for impairment annually.
2 Segmental reporting Segmental reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments, which are the primary basis of segmental reporting.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
As the Group has no material activities outside the UK, segment reporting is not required by geographical region.
The chief operating decision-makers CODM have been identified as the Groups Executive Chairman and Finance Director.
The CODM review the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments as Housebuilding, including Linden Homes and Galliford Try Partnerships: Construction, including Building and Infrastructure: and PPP Investments.
The CODM assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted earnings before finance costs, amortisation, exceptional items and taxation.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments, such as restructuring costs and impairments when the impairment is the result of an isolated, non-recurring event.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
Accordingly, the Groups profits for the accounting period to 30 June 2015 are taxed at a blended standard rate of 20.75%.
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above, further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the July 2015 UK Budget Statement.

8 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted Earnings Per Share EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option in the period.
The dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option price.
Only shares that have met their cumulative performance criteria are included in the dilution calculation.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive schemes.
A loss per share cannot be reduced through dilution, hence this dilution is only applied where the Group has reported a profit.

This has been allocated to the Building and Housebuilding segments.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs identified according to business segment.
The goodwill is attributable to the following business segments: 2015 2014 m m Linden Homes 52.5 52.2 Galliford Try Partnerships 5.8 5.8 Building 40.0 19.8 Infrastructure 37.2 37.2 135.5 115.0 Impairment review of goodwill and key assumptions Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on future financial budgets approved by the Board, based on past performance and its expectation of market developments.
The key assumptions within these budgets relate to revenue and the future profit margin achievable, in line with our strategy as set out in the Strategic Report.
Future budgeted revenue is based on managements knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with the existing secured works, managements expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses.
In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being achieved are considered inconjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and to reflect the current market value of land being acquired.
Cash is monitored very closely on a daily, weekly and monthly basis for the purposes of managing both treasury and the business as a whole.
Details of the Groups treasury management are included within the financial review on pages 16 to 19 of the Annual Report.
The assumptions used are reviewed regularly and differences between forecast and actual results are closely monitored with variances being investigated fully.
The knowledge gained from this past experience is used to ensure that the future assumptions used are consistent with past actual outcomes and are managements best estimate of the future cash flows of each business unit.
Cash flows beyond the budgeted three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum within Building, Infrastructure and Housebuilding.
The growth rate used is the Groups estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors in which the CGU operates.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12.1% 2014: 12.1% in Linden Homes, 9.9% 2014: 10.2% in Galliford Try Partnerships, 9.3% 2014: 10.1% in Building and 10.1% 2014: 10.9% in Infrastructure has been applied to the future cash flows, basedon a estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of each division.
Sensitivities The recoverable value of all CGUs are substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU.
Taking into account current market conditions within the construction and housebuilding markets, none of these sensitivities, either individually or combined, resulted in the recoverable amount of the goodwill being reduced to below its current carrying value.
The detailed sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase of more than 17% 2014: 31% in the pre-tax discount rate or a reduction of21% 2014: 22% in the forecast operating cash flows of the Linden Homes CGU could give rise to an impairment.
The goodwill intheother segments is less sensitive to the detailed assumptions used and hence no additional disclosure is considered necessary.
Fixed assets included 1.5 million net book value, and 0.5 million depreciation, for assets held under finance leases 2014: 1.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively.

The shared equity receivables largely have repayment dates that can vary and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of the sales transaction and are secured by a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future receivable by the Group, discounted back to present values.
The fair value of the future anticipated receipts takes into account the directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and credit risk.
These assumptions are reviewed atthe end of each financial reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value onthe anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk, which is largely mitigated by holding a second charge over the property, is accounted forindetermining the fair values and appropriate discount rates that are applied.
The directors review the financial assets for impairmentateach balance sheet date.
The Group has sold the majority of its shared equity portfolio.
Including the sale of the portfolio, during the year the Groups net investment in shared equity receivables decreased by 21.5 million 2014: 2.9 million.
There was Nil new shared equity receivables inthe period and 0.8 million 2014: 1.6 million arose on the unwind of the discount applied on initial recognition of the receivables atfair value, which has been shown as finance income in the income statement.
An impairment of 0.5 million 2014: 1.7 million arose due to the variation in current assumptions compared to the original calculations.
There were disposals in the year of 21.8 million 2014: 2.6 million, relating to the repayment of shared equity receivables and the sale of the portfolio, generating a profit  2014: 0.8 million.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the book value of each class of receivable mentioned above, along with the Groups investment in shared equity receivables note 14, and its cash and cash equivalents.
The Group does not hold any collateral assecurity.
Management believes that the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Major water industry customers accounted for in total 4% 2014: 8% of Group revenue in the year.
However, the customers involved comprise a variety of entities including those both in the public and commercial sectors.
In addition, within the commercial sector each customer has an unrelated ultimate Parent Company.

The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 578.1 million of bank accounts in credit offset against 413.2 million overdrafts with the same counterparty 2014: 707.8 million and 567.4 million, respectively.
The Group and Company operate within financial risk policies and procedures approved by the Board.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
The Groups and Companys financial instruments principally comprise bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, available for sale financial assets, and interest rate swaps that arise directly from its operations and its acquisitions.
Capital risk management The Groups and Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, inorder to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital requirements of the Groups divisions differs, with housebuilding typically requiring debt and partnerships and construction typically being cash generative, and the economic cycle of each division is also different.
The Group manages itscapital taking these differing requirements into account.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group and Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
In 2014, the Group increased its bank facilities to 400million, following a review of its future capital requirements undertaken in the context of the Groups strategy to 2018 and the Group is targeting period-end gearing of no more than 30%.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debtdivided by total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown intheconsolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group held net debt at 30 June 2015 and had gearing of 3%.
The Group also held net debt at 30 June 2014, with gearing of 1%.
The Group also has capital requirements in the covenants initsbankfacilities, as set out later in this note.
The Group has complied with all bank covenants during the year.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 100 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Financial risk factors a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk All material activities of the Group take place within the UK and consequently there is little direct exchange risk other than payments to overseas suppliers who require settlement in their currency.
If there is any material foreign exchange exposure, the Groups policy is to enter into forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group and Company have no material currency exposure at 30 June 2015 2014: Nil.
ii Price risk The Group is affected by the level of UK house prices.
These are in turn affected by factors such as mortgage availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and availability of land with planning.
While it is not possible to fully mitigate such risks the Group continues to monitor its geographical spread within the UK concentrating its operations in areas that management believes minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
As at 30 June 2015, the Groups house price linked financial instruments consisted entirely of shared equity receivables held as available for sale financial assets and the sensitivity to house price inflation anddiscount rates was not significant.
The concentration of the financial risk lies within price risk as a result of these financial instruments being linked to house prices.
The Group has no quoted investments that are exposed to equity securities price risk.
The Group and Company are not exposed tocommodity price risk.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from movement in cash and cash equivalents, and long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued atvariable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk as long asthe effect of various changes in rates remains within prescribed ranges.
Details of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group are set out below.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
On a regular basis the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift on the Groups borrowing position.
Based on the forecasts performed, the impact on post tax profit and equity of a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates for a year would be a maximum increase of 0.7 million 2014: 1.7 million or decrease of 0.8 million 2014: 1.7 million, respectively.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits and borrowings with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables including shared equity receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a credit risk exposure to the providers of its banking facilities.
These are primarily provided by HSBC Bank plc, Abbey National Treasury Services plc Santander, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Barclays Bank plc, being four of the UKs leading financial institutions.
Further details of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 18.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does notexpect any material losses from non-performance of any counterparties, including in respect of receivables not yet due.
c Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The contracting operations of the Group generally generate cash.
The Housebuilding operations, however, utilise cash and any future downturn in the housebuilding market may require additional borrowings, in addition to retained earnings, to finance the maintenance of the landbank and associated work inprogress.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve, which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities seebelow, and cash and cash equivalents note 19 on the basis of expected cash flow.
This is generally carried out at local level in theoperating companies of the Group, in accordance with practices and limits set by the Group.
These limits vary by location totake into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates.
On a daily basis throughout the year, the bank balances orborrowings in all the Groups operating companies are aggregated into a total cash or borrowings figure, in order that the Group canobtain the most advantageous interest rate.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
No such embedded derivatives have been identified.

During the year ending 30 June 2015 the Group entered into a five-year interest rate swap contract that expires in February 2020.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 30 June 2015 was 100 million and the fixed interest rate is 1.4%.
Each swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and changes in fair value are recognised directly in reserves.
Aloss of 0.3 million 2014: gain 1.1 million was recognised in other comprehensive income in the period.
Gains and losses recognised in reserves will be released to the income statement within finance costs over the period to maturity of the contract, and 0.1 million 2014: 0.3 million was recognised in the current year.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at the prevailing interest rate.

In February 2015, the Group agreed a one-year extension on the facility, to 2020.
The facility provides long-term finance and bonding facilities and is subject to covenants overinterest cover, gearing adjusted to take account of development land payables and minimum consolidated tangible net assets.
Interest is calculated by aggregating margin, LIBOR and relevant costs.
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 102 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Fair value estimation Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments are defined as: Level 1 Quoted market prices or dealer quotes in active markets for similar instruments.
Level 2 The fair value of equity securities and interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, based on observable yield curves, as set out in note 14.
Level 3 Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of available for sale financial assets is set out in note 14.

The increase in equity securities includes assets acquired with Miller Construction see note 31.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The Companys only liabilities that are measured at fair value are derivatives used for hedging, as shown in the table above.

The typical repayment period is 1015 years and the timing of receipts is based on historical data.
The discount rateof 5.5% and future house price movements used to compute the fair value typically 2.5% are based on local market conditions.
The sensitivity to house price inflation and discount rates is set out earlier in this note.
If receipts were to occur earlier than expected, thefair value would increase.
The total impact in the period of Level 3, taken to the income statements, is a net charge of 0.1 million 30 June 2014: 0.9 million incost of sales and 0.8 million 30 June 2014: 1.6 million finance income.

The acquisition was of the entire share capital and control of Construction Holdco 2 Limited, Miller Construction Holdings Limited, Miller Construction Limited, Miller Integrated Services Limited and Schools for the Community Limited.
Construction Holdco 2 Limited is the Parent Company of Miller Construction UK Limited and other companies that, together, comprise Miller Construction.
The Group has also entered into an agreement to purchase The Miller Group Limited for 1 at a future date.
TheMiller Group Limited is not expected to have any identifiable assets or liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Miller Construction is a UK only construction business which delivers building and infrastructure projects to both the public and private sectors.
The tactical acquisition of Miller Construction is consistent with Galliford Trys stated strategy of disciplined and selective growth in its construction business, with a particular focus on developing our positions on regional and national frameworks.
The transaction accelerates the growth in construction turnover towards 1.25 billion, and increases the 2018 target to circa 1.5 billion.
Theacquired order book of 1.4 billion doubled the Groups 30 June 2014 order book to 2.8 billion.
The goodwill of 20.2 million arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired workforce of Miller Construction and annual costsynergies identified by Galliford Try.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The following table summarises the consideration paid for Miller Construction, and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed: m Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and cash equivalents 23.6 Property plant and equipment 6.1 1 Intangible assets 12.1 Available for sale financial assets 10.3 2 Trade and other receivables 60.8 Trade and other payables 113.9 3 Deferred tax liabilities 2.6 Total identifiable net liabilities 3.6 Goodwill 20.2 Total 16.6 Consideration at 9 July 2014 4 Cash 16.6 Total 16.6 1 Intangible assets of 12.1 million comprise customer relationships and contracts.

4 Cash consideration included 2.0 million paid into an escrow account until 31 October 2014.
The consideration was subject to the satisfactory resolution of certain customer contract matters, that were fully resolved prior to 31 October 2014.
The Group assumed responsibility for 44.6 million guarantees and contingent liabilities in relation to performance bonds issued in the normal course of business.
While the outcome of disputes arising in the normal course of business is never certain, the directors have made proper provision in the acquired balance sheet for liabilities they believe exist.
The Group has completed the operational integration of Miller Construction and, as a result, it is impractical to accurately represent and report the post-acquisition performance of Miller Construction.
Based on its performance in its last full financial year before acquisition, the Group estimates that the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2015 includes approximately 400 million of revenue contributed by Miller Construction, which is predominately in the Building segment.
In addition, the Groups consolidated income statement includes 2.2 million amortisation of intangible assets and 3.7 million exceptional costs related to MillerConstruction.
The exceptional costs comprise mainly redundancy and other restructuring costs, generating synergy savings inexcess of 8 million per annum.
Given that the acquisition occurred on 9 July 2014, the Groups consolidated income statement would not be significantly different had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the reporting period.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.6 million were charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2014, being the period that the costs were incurred.
