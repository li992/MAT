These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed five year forecasts.
This information has been approved by the Board: The key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows: Pre-tax discount rates range from 1017% 2014: 1116% : Short-term growth rates vary between 230% depending on detailed forecasts 2014: 27%.
The short-term is defined as not more than five years.
The 30% rate is in respect of Spirax-Sarco Colombia SAS: Long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts and vary between 0.85.0% 2014: 1.06.0% : and No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest goodwill balances were as follows: Pre-tax Short-term Long-term Cash-generating unit discount rate growth rate growth rate Spirax-Sarco Mexicana 14.1% 4.0% 2.8% Flexicon A S Denmark 10.4% 3.0% 2.0% MasoSine 11.5% 2.5% 1.3% Sensitivity analysis shows that if long-term revenue growth assumptions are lowered by 1% and pre-tax discount rates raised by 1%, no impairment would arise.
The 1% sensitivity threshold is considered a reasonable estimate of possible change.

24 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 7,997,000 2014: 9,074,000.
In the UK, following the closure ofthe defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements The Group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the Groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the US as well as less material schemes elsewhere.
In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately half of the Groups net balance sheet liability for defined retirement benefit schemes.
Spirax-Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax-Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax-Sarco Executives' Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Watson-Marlow Pension Fund.
These are all final salary pension schemes.
The UK schemes are closed to new members but are open to future accrual.
There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of.
All three schemes have been setup under UK Law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax-Sarco.
Further information on the contribution commitments is shown in the Financial review on pages 52 to 53.
US defined benefit schemes The Group operates a pension scheme in the US which is open to new entrants and defines the pension in terms of the highest average pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement.
No pension increases in payment and deferment are offered by this scheme.
It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the US, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal risks The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increases on benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes.
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact on the Groups pension schemes.
The IAS 19 liability measurement DBO and the Service Cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of DBO.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 148.

Share-based payments Disclosures of the share-based payments offered to employees are set out below.
More detail on each scheme is given in the Annual report on remuneration 2015 on pages 92 to 93.
The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments is made up as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Share Option Scheme 131 Performance Share Plan 2,495 1,453 Employee Share Ownership Plan 835 790 Total expense recognised in income statement 3,330 2,374 Share Option Scheme The Group operates equity settled share option schemes for employees, although no grants have been made since 2011 because awards have been made using the Group's Performance Share Plan instead.
Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective was to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted before 2007 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
The performance criteria is split into two separate parts.
For awards granted up to 2013 60% of the award is based on a TSR measure where the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
For awards granted up to 2013 the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
From 2014 the Remuneration Committee have changed the weighting between the TSR and EPS elements to 40% TSR and 60% EPS.
From 2015 a change has been made to measure EPS on a point to point basis over the three year performance period.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 152 Annual Report 2015 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000. Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 153 Annual Report 2015 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements continued 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Financial instruments fair value disclosure Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into level 2.

Floating rate financial assets comprise cash at bank or placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates.
The average rate of interest received on sterling deposits during the year was nil 2014: nil.
Currency exposures As explained above, the Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December 2015 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary asset of 2,337,000 2014: 335,000 net monetary asset and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 5,478,000 2014: net monetary asset 422,000.

Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market by discounting the future contracted cash flows using readily available market data.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 157 Annual Report 2015 Corporate Information Financial Statements Governance Report Strategic Report Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements continued 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31st December 2015, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 600,000 2014: 50,000 reduction.
For the year ended 31st December 2015, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1,500,000 2014: 2,400,000.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
