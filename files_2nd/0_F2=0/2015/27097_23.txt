Factors that may affect future tax charges At 30 April 2015 the Company had a potential deferred tax asset of 7,102,000 2014 5,681,000 in respect of taxable losses which are available to be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been provided on these losses as it is considered unlikely that the Company will make suitable taxable revenue profits in excess of deductible expenses in future periods.
The potential deferred tax asset has been calculated using a corporation tax rate of 20% 2014 20%.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

In accordance with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the above tables provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value hierarchy described on page 39, which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair value.
38 Annual Report 2015 Financial Report 9 Investments continued Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 investments with quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 investments whose fair value is based directly on observable current market prices or is indirectly being derived from market prices: and Level 3 investments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable current market prices or are not based on observable market data.
The purchases and sales proceeds figures above include transaction costs of 1,154,000 2014 388,000 and 471,000 2014 315,000 respectively.
Of the realised gains on sales of fixed investments during the year of 245,937,000 2014 gains of 78,357,000, a net gain of 175,541,000 2014 88,999,000 was included in investment holding gains losses at the previous year end.
The Monks Investment Trust PLC 39 Financial Report 9 Investments continued The tables below show a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The gains and losses shown in the tables have all been included in the Income Statement on page 31 within gains losses on investments.
The values of level 3 investments are calculated using valuation techniques based upon the latest dealing prices, stockbroker valuations, net asset values and other information as appropriate.
The Company believes that other reasonably possible alternative valuations for its Level 3 holdings would not be significantly different from those included in the financial statements.

Shareholders funds as reported in the balance sheet has been computed in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26.
A reconciliation of the two sets of figures under these two conventions is given in note 15.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing net asset value per ordinary share from 478.3p to 476.0p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2015 of 435.1p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 8.6% as against 9.0% on a traditional basis.
At 30 April 2014 the effect would have been to reduce net asset value per ordinary share from 426.8p to 425.2p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2014 of 370.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 13.0% as against 13.3% on a traditional basis.

21 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
Details of any derivative financial instruments open at the balance sheet date are shown on page 48.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
44 Annual Report 2015 Financial Report 21 Financial Instruments continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 30 April 2015, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments other than its fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the fair value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value assuming that the Companys share price is unaffected by movements in interest rates.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 April is shown below.

Prior to redemption, the value of the interest rate swap element will vary depending on several factors such as the level of swap rates and the implied volatility of interest rate swap options.

The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objective and investment policy.

99% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities 2014 95%.
After taking into account the impact of any equity index options open at the balance sheet date, a 5% increase in quoted equity valuations at 30 April 2015 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 50,649,000 2014 45,824,000.
A decrease of 5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.

The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
The Companys current borrowing facilities are detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the maturity profile of its borrowings is set out above.
Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Depositary is liable for the loss of financial instruments held in custody.
The Depositary will ensure that any delegate segregates the assets of the Company.
The Depositary has delegated the custody function to Bank of New York Mellon SA NV London Branch.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting their findings to the Board: The Monks Investment Trust PLC 47 Financial Report 21 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk continued investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily done on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: the creditworthiness of the counterparty to transactions involving derivatives, structured notes and other arrangements, wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Manager: and cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Managers as reputable and of high credit quality.
