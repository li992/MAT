Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Merger reserve On 30 April 2014 Card Factory plc acquired 100% of the share capital of CF Topco Limited in a share for share exchange, thereby inserting Card Factory plc as the Parent Company of the Group.
The shareholders of CF Topco Limited became 100% owners of the enlarged share capital of Card Factory plc.
The premium arising on the issue of shares is recognised in the merger reserve.
Share based payments The Company issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees of the Company and subsidiary undertakings.
The cost of equity-settled share awards is measured as the fair value of the award at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model.
The cost of awards to employees of the Company is expensed to the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The cost of awards to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised as a capital contribution, immediately reimbursed by the subsidiary.
The total cost of the awards is based on the Groups estimate of the number of share awards that will eventually vest in accordance with the vesting conditions.
The awards do not include market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Any revision to estimates is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The expense recognised in the Company income statement is subsequently charged to subsidiary entities to the extent that management services are provided to those subsidiary entities.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or through other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
New standards and interpretations These are the first financial statements of the Company, consequently there are no changes in accounting policies arising due to changes in accounting standards.
