com Our Financials Accounting Policies Foreign Currency Translation Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.
Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement.
Taxation Tax is recognised in the Income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of the Company financial statements requires the use of certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions relevant to the Consolidated financial statements are embedded with the relevant notes to the Consolidated financial statements.

For all unapproved schemes and the Cash LTIP, the Company is liable to pay employers NIC upon allotment of the share awards.
Unapproved schemes are the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Chairmans Share Matching Award, the Growth Incentive Plan GIP and unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
For more details on these schemes, refer to note 4.10 to the consolidated financial statements.
In the prior year, the Company established the Cash LTIP in order to incentivise selected high performing employees of the Group.
At the end of the three-year vesting period, employees will be paid a cash amount equal to the notional number of awards at the prevailing share price, adjusted for the achievement of the performance conditions.

The Cash LTIP provision represents the expected cash payments to participants upon vesting of the awards.
It has been calculated using various assumptions regarding liquidity, participants retention and achievability of the performance conditions.
and valued with reference to the year end share price.
If at any point following initial valuation any of these assumptions are revised, the charge will need to be amended accordingly.
In addition to the base cost, since this is a cash benefit, the Company will be liable to pay employers NIC on the value of the cash award upon vesting, which is included in the above employers NIC provision.
To calculate the employers NIC provision, the applicable employers NIC rate is applied to the number of share awards which are expected to vest, valued with reference to the year-end share price.
The number of share awards expected to vest is dependent on various assumptions which are determined by management: namely participants retention rate, the expectation of meeting the performance criteria, if any, and the liquidity discount.
All assumptions are supported by historical trends and internal financial forecasts, where appropriate.
For the GIP, an external valuation was carried out to determine the fair value of the awards granted see Note 4.10 g in the consolidated financial statements.
If at any point during the life of each share award, any non-market conditions are subject to change, such as the retention rate or the likelihood of the performance condition being met, the number of share awards likely to vest will need to be recalculated which will cause the value of the employers NIC provision to change accordingly.
Once the share awards under each of the schemes have vested, the provision will be utilised when they are allotted to participants.
Vesting will occur between 2016 and 2019.
com Our Financials Section 4 Capital Structure and Financing Costs 4.1 Share Capital and Premium Accounting Policies Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share Capital and Premium Included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding below are 34,770,981 2014: 34,810,561 ordinary shares held by the Groups employee benefit trust see Note 4.10 b in the Consolidated financial statements.
The ordinary shares held by the trustee of the Groups employee benefit trust pursuant to the Joint Share Ownership Scheme are treated as treasury shares in the Groups Consolidated balance sheet in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
These ordinary shares have voting rights but these have been waived by the trustee.
The number of allotted, called up and fully paid shares, excluding treasury shares, at the end of each period differs from that used in the basic profit per share calculation in Note 2.9 of the Consolidated financial statements, as basic profit per share is calculated using the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury shares.
At 29 November 2015, the number of ordinary shares available for issue under the Block Listing Facilities was 14,620,308 2014: 19,094,500.
These ordinary shares will only become allotted when the shares under the Share Incentive Plan have been awarded or the share options under the Groups executive share ownership scheme, non-employee share options and Sharesave schemes have been exercised, and are therefore not included in the total number of ordinary shares outstanding.

4.3 Financial Instruments Accounting Policies Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company classifies its financial instruments into available-for-sale, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition or in certain circumstances on modification.
Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values but for completeness are included in the analysis below.

Exposure to Credit Risk The carrying value of financial assets, as set out in Note 4.3, represents the maximum credit exposure.
No collateral is held as security against these assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companys exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by investing in banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings and by regular review of counterparty risk.
Other Receivables Other receivables at the end of both periods consist primarily of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
Management provides for irrecoverable debts when there are indicators that a balance may not be recoverable.
The ageing of other receivables at the balance sheet date is set out below: 29 November 2015 30 November 2014 Gross Impairment Gross Impairment Notes 000 000 000 000 Not past due 240.4 203.2 Past due 03 months Past due 36 months Past due over 6 months 3.3 240.4 203.2 There were no unimpaired balances at the period end where the Company had renegotiated the terms.
Management has not provided for irrecoverable debts against any of its other receivable balances.
4.5 Liquidity Risk To manage the working capital needs of the business, the Group entered into a three-year 100 million revolving credit facility with Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Santander in the prior period.
During the current period the facility was extended by two years to 2019 and the amount was increased to 210 million.
As at 29 November 2015 the facility remains unutilised.
The Company monitors cash flow as part of its day-to-day control procedures and the Board considers cash flow projections on a monthly basis.
For further details on the Groups capital management strategy see Note 4.11 in the Consolidated financial statements.
The table below analyses the Companys financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the Balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the carrying values and undiscounted contractual cash flows.

No financial assets are held in foreign currencies.
Due to the Companys lack of exposure to currency risk, no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest Rate Risk The Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities and its interest bearing financial assets consist of only cash and cash equivalents and certain amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
These financial assets are exposed to interest rate risk as the Company holds money market deposits at floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by investing cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks split between fixed-term deposits, notice accounts and money market funds.
At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Companys interest bearing financial instruments was: 29 November 30 November 2015 2014 m m Fixed Rate Instruments Financial assets 17.9 33.2 Variable Rate Instruments Financial assets 1.0 20.2 Sensitivity Analysis An increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates would increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
A rate of 100 basis points was deemed appropriate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
The calculation applies the increase to average floating rate interest bearing borrowings and cash and cash equivalents existing during the period.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.
