Risks arising from financial instruments The maturity of the Group and Companys external bond and external bank borrowings is as follows: Risk management Treasury related risks Group Company The Board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations.

The Treasury Committee is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority.
Treasury activities and M M M M compliance with the treasury policies are reported to the Board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, Borrowings both internal and external.
Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and Repayable: liquidity risk: interest rate risk: currency risk: and counterparty risk.
This is to ensure that the Group is properly funded: that interest rate and currency risk is managed within set limits: and that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality.

Total 556.9 478.3 469.0 426.2 Liquidity risk The average period to maturity of the Groups external bonds and committed external borrowing facilities is 4.0 years 2014: 4.1 years.
The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth.
The short-term nature of the Groups business means that the majority of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months The currency exposure on external borrowings is as follows: with an average period to maturity of around six months.
The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low.
The treasury policy Group Company adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities to 2015 2014 2015 2014 cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress-testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis.
Further, the aim is M M M M to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates: that there is diversification of debt funding sources: that there is Sterling 103.2 100.4 103.2 100.4 no over-reliance on a single or small group of lenders: and that debt facilities and hedging capacity are sufficient for the currency requirements Polish zloty 38.2 37.6 of each country.

Amounts receivable from customers Risk management policies in respect of amounts receivable from customers are discussed in the credit risk section within this note.
Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and, therefore, seeks to limit this net exposure.
This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest costs, including fixed rate funding predominantly longer-term bond funding : forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding: bank borrowing loan draw-down periods: and interest rate hedging instruments.
These techniques are used to hedge the interest costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time, up to seven years, although most hedging is for up to two years.
Interest costs are a relatively low proportion of the Groups revenue 5.7% in 2015: 5.8% in 2014 and therefore the risk of a material impact on profitability arising from a change in interest rates is low.
If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the following impact: 2015 2014 Group M M Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 3.2 0.3 Reduction in profit before taxation 0.6 0.2 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: the change in the market interest rate occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and or derivative financial instruments: where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates: and changes in market interest rate affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Currency risk The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure: cash flow exposure: and income statement exposure.

The balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means Outflow Inflow Outflow Inflow Company M M M M that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
The impact in 2015 is a decrease in net assets of 23.9 million 2014: decrease of 42.3 million.
The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in Not later than one month 2.1 1.8 0.3 0.3 each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables with borrowings in local currency, where possible.

The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate.
A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the period.

The Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks: and foreign currency and Amounts receivable from customers derivative financial instruments.
Risk management policies in respect of amounts receivable from customers are discussed in the credit risk section within this note.
The Group only deposits cash, and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict Interest rate risk limits in respect of the amount of exposure to any one institution.
Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with Board approval.
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and, therefore, seeks No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets.
The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows: to limit this net exposure.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
Amounts receivable from customers The Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the countries in which it operates.
Nevertheless, the Group is subject to a risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers.
This risk is minimised by the use of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group lends only to those customers who we believe can afford the repayments.
The amount loaned to each customer and the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk category the customer is assigned to as part of the credit scoring process.
The level of expected future losses is generated on a weekly or monthly basis by business line and geographical segment.
These outputs are reviewed by management to ensure that appropriate action can be taken if results differ from management expectations.
2015 2014 Group M M Amounts receivable from customers 802.4 760.5 The table above represents the maximum exposure to credit risk of the Group at the year end.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers by geographical segment is presented in note 16.
Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost and calculated in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Those amounts receivable from customers that are neither past due nor impaired represent loans where no customer payments have been missed and there is, therefore, no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate.
Amounts receivable from customers include 5.8 million that is past due but not impaired 2014: 6.2 million.
This is in relation to the first four weeks of loans for home credit new customers, and allows a repayment pattern to be established.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are individually determined to be impaired is set out by geographical segment below: Not impaired Impaired 2015 2014 2015 2014 Group M M M M Poland-Lithuania 79.9 74.5 223.1 221.1 Czech-Slovakia 32.4 43.3 83.4 108.9 Southern Europe 65.8 60.2 114.7 120.0 Mexico 28.6 33.1 118.8 99.4 Digital 53.1 2.6 259.8 211.1 542.6 549.4 This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment.
The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage.
This results in a significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge.
For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued.
There will, therefore, be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable.
The carrying value of the Slovakian loan receivables reflects the impairment described in note 10, however up to date customer balances are not shown as impaired.

The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each 2015 2014 arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage.
This results in a significant proportion Group M M of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge.
For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired Assets depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued.
There will, therefore, Foreign currency contracts 11.5 5.8 be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable.

The fair value of the bonds has been calculated by reference to their market value.
The carrying value of bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value.
Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date.
The impact of discounting would therefore be negligible.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction.
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
