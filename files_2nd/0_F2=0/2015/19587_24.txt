The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax, before amortisation of acquired intangibles, restructuring costs, acquisition expenses and contingent consideration, other one-off items, profits and losses arising on the sale of businesses and associated impairment charges, trading profits and losses associated with disposed businesses, unwinding of provision discounting and fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, of 87.4m is 24.0% 2014: 28.1%, which comprises a tax charge of 24.8% 2014: 27.3% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 0.8% 2014: charge of 0.8% in respect of prior years.
in 2014, a deferred tax asset of 14.9m was recognised in respect of previously unrecognised UK excess non-trading losses incurred in 2008 see Note 22.
The following factors will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium Netherlands corporate tax rates greater than 20% and ireland Poland corporate tax rates less than 20%.
if the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: the agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with a corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 22. in addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income with the exception of deferred tax on share options which has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

Awards have also been made annually since 2011 through a shadow Cash LTiP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the LTiP, the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTiNUED b Long-term Incentive plan LtIp continued The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected percentage of total options exercised is based on the Directors best estimate for the effects of behavioural considerations.
c share Incentive plan sIp The SiP is offered to UK employees.
The SiP is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
The Company gives one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of 20 each month.
No performance criteria are attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
in 2015, 108,120 2014: 72,238 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

GOODWILL CONTiNUED Impairment review process The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
in respect of the other assumptions, external data and managements best estimates are applied.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following years budget and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%-3% over a further period of four years.
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 3% in perpetuity.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates and range between 7.9% and 10.8%.
2015 impairment review results The carrying value of the Groups CGUs remain supportable.
sensitivity analysis A number of sensitivities have been performed on the Groups significant CGUs to highlight the changes in market conditions that would lead to verge of impairment.
The results are as follows: 2015 like-for-like market volume long-term operating profit growth average % per annum Discount rate % rate average % per annum CGU headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 520.5m 0.6 15.1 8.9 19.1 3.0 13.9 UK Exteriors 545.4m 0.9 22.4 8.9 16.4 3.0 12.0 Larivire 48.6m 1.4 4.8 10.8 1.7 2.0 1.5 2014 Long-term operating Like-for-like market volume profit growth rate average % per annum Discount rate % average % per annum CGU Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 678.7m 0.7 20.2 9.2 30.4 3.0 21.2 UK Exteriors 565.1m 0.9 25.9 9.2 24.8 3.0 17.6 Larivire 90.3m 0.4 9.3 11.0 2.9 2.2 1.6 The sensitivities noted above are the amounts by which the related assumption would have to vary before an impairment is indicated.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in revenue has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of iAS 36 impairment of Assets.
if a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from the forecast used in the goodwill impairment reviews, an impairment of 1.8m would arise in one CGU, Larivire.
The Board has actively reviewed the forecast associated with Larivire, noting the conservative assumptions used and, in a challenging economic environment, its continued outperformance of the markets in which it operates, and is satisfied that no impairment is necessary.
if revenues fell by 4.8% then the recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying value.
The current forecasts provide headroom of 35.7m.

it is currently expected that, dependent upon future profits, a further 30.9m may be paid to the vendors of recent acquisitions who are employed by the Group.
These payments are contingent upon the vendors remaining within the business and, as required by iFRS 3, this will be treated as remuneration and will be charged to the Consolidated income Statement as earned.
The related accrual of potential consideration in the year to 31 December 2015 is 10.2m 31 December 2014: 2.9m.
Added to the 1.9m acquisition expenses is a 2.2m increase in contingent consideration based solely on a reassessment of post-acquisition performance of the acquired businesses outside of the hindsight period, this has led to a charge within Other items in the Consolidated income Statement of 14.3m in respect of acquisitions see Note 2. in addition, 8.9m of deferred and contingent consideration not subject to the vendors remaining within the business has been recognised within goodwill and intangible assets in the year.
The Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2016.
These fair value adjustments may relate primarily to: a the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their fair value: b the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group: and c an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Groups policies.
The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of 20.9m and a gross contractual value of 21.4m.
The best estimate at the date of acquisition of the contractual cash flows not able to be collected is 0.5m.
included within goodwill is the benefit of staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
The goodwill of 29.4m arising from the acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Post-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 for all 2015 acquisitions amounted to 57.6m and 7.5m respectively.
The Directors estimate that the combined pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2015 acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2015 to the acquisition dates was 61.4m and 8.4m respectively.

No interest is charged on receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 18.8m at 31 December 2015 2014: 20.7m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
included within the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 138.6m 2014: 130.5m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 34 days overdue 2014: 31 days.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 25.7m 2014: 31.7m and a provision for impairment of 18.8m 2014: 20.7m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Treasury Risk Management section of the Strategic Report on pages 37 to 40 includes a review of all liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks, and provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The capital structure of the Group is outlined in the Strategic Report on page 36.
The Groups financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, cash at bank and derivative financial instruments.
The following financial assets form part of the net debt of the Group: 2015 2014 m m Cash and cash equivalents including cash deposits repayable on demand 89.0 110.3 Other financial assets 1.3 0.9 Deferred consideration 1.5 1.5 Derivative financial instruments 36.8 33.9 Total 128.6 146.6 The Directors consider the fair value of financial assets to approximate to their book value.
The interest received on cash deposits is at variable rates of up to 1.4% 2014: 2.0%.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Of the above cash at bank, 17.3m 2014: 15.9m is denominated in Sterling, 55.0m 2014: 78.1m in Euros, 12.9m 2014: 14.1m in Polish Zloty, and 3.8m 2014: 2.2m in other currencies.
Of the other financial assets, 1.3m 2014: 0.7m is denominated in Sterling, and nil 2014: 0.2m in Euros.
The deferred consideration is denominated in Sterling.
2015 interest rate and currency profile The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups borrowings at 31 December 2015, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments including derivative assets of 36.8m as noted above was as follows: weighted average Effective time for Floating Fixed fixed interest which Amount Amount Total rate rate rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency m m m % years m m Private placement notes Sterling 145.8 92.8 53.0 5.8 0.8 145.8 Other borrowings Sterling 68.1 25.0 43.1 1.8 0.2 68.1 Finance lease contracts Sterling 0.4 0.4 6.2 3.7 0.4 Private placement notes Euro 73.4 73.4 4.0 6.5 73.4 Other borrowings Euro 27.9 27.9 n a n a 0.6 27.3 Finance lease contracts Euro 7.6 7.6 5.9 6.0 7.6 Other borrowings Polish Zloty 0.3 0.3 n a n a 0.3 Finance lease contracts Polish Zloty 2.0 2.0 3.3 4.3 2.0 Other borrowings US Dollar 2.2 2.2 1.8 1.1 1.9 0.3 Total 327.7 146.0 181.7 12.8 314.9 in addition to the currency exposures above, the Group has entered into a short-term currency derivative financial instrument which alters the currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities.
A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of 45.5m and a liability of 62.0m was entered into on 31 December 2015 at market rates and therefore the fair value is deemed to equate to its book value of nil.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2015 was 235.9m, of which 99.4m is denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling 10.0m, are secured on the underlying assets.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to materially approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups private placement notes at 31 December 2015 is estimated to be c. 248m and is classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 55.3m and relates to finance lease contracts, fixed rate loans and loan notes after applying financial instruments and deferred consideration.
The Directors consider the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to materially approximate to the book values shown above.

A net investment hedge amounting to an asset of 48.3m and a liability of 62.0m was entered into on 31 December 2014 at market rates and therefore the fair value was deemed to equate to its book value of nil.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2014 was 126.9m, of which 61.0m was denominated in Euros.
All of the above finance lease contracts, totalling 10.5m, were secured on the underlying assets.
in both 2015 and 2014, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is based upon appropriate local market rates.
Hedging relationships included within financial assets are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 36.8m 2014: 33.9m and loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents of 485.8m 2014: 477.4m.
included within financial liabilities are derivative financial instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships amounting to 1.6m 2014: 1.1m and liabilities including trade payables at amortised cost of 685.1m 2014: 573.6m.
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of iAS 32 and iAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments for cash flow and net investment hedges will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as gains and losses on derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated income Statement in the column entitled Other items.
in order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate, exchange rate, and commodity price changes, the Group utilises interest rate, currency, and commodity derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the financial instruments on pages 138 and 139 are categorised as Level 2.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTiNUED a Net investment hedges As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2014: one cross-currency forward contract which swaps Sterling denominated debt into Euro denominated debt.
This derivative financial instrument is a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated assets and is designated and effective as a net investment hedge.
The fair value of this derivative was nil at 31 December 2013, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, therefore the fair value movement to be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income in both 2014 and 2015 is nil.
b Cash flow hedges With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated income Statement within finance costs in the same period the hedged item affects the Consolidated income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into two 31 December 2014: two cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
in addition, as at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into one 31 December 2014: one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swaps fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt into variable rate Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2015, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 0.8 years 2014: 1.8 years.
2015 2014 Hedge of the Groups functional currency cash flows m m Asset at 1 January 29.0 24.4 Fair value gains recognised in equity 4.4 4.6 Asset at 31 December 33.4 29.0 Of the above derivative financial instruments, 33.4m matures within one year 2014: nil.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into two 31 December 2014: one interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap variable rate debt into fixed rate debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2015, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 4.1 years 2014: 3.6 years.

The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis and therefore is exposed to changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had entered into two 31 December 2014: nil fuel price derivative financial instruments which swap variable price fuel into fixed price fuel, thereby creating an element of fuel cost certainty for the Group.
One of these fuel price derivative financial instruments is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2015, the maturity date of this swap is one year.
2015 2014 Hedge of the Groups fuel costs m m Liability at 1 January Fair value losses recognised in equity 0.9 Liability at 31 December 0.9 Of the above derivative financial instrument, 0.9m matures within one year 2014: nil.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTiNUED b Cash flow hedges continued The remaining fuel price derivative financial instrument had not been designated as a cash flow hedge and the fair value movement of 0.4m has therefore been charged through Other items in the Consolidated income Statement.
At 31 December 2015, the maturity date of this swap is one year, and therefore 0.4m of this derivative financial instrument matures within one year 2014: nil.
The following table reconciles the net fair value gain recognised in equity on cash flow hedges as noted on page 138 of 3.4m 2014: 4.0m to the loss on cash flow hedges recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income of 1.9m 2014: 1.4m.

c Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2015, the Group had entered into two 31 December 2014: two derivative financial instruments which hedge the fair value of the fixed interest private placement notes drawn down on 1 February 2007.
All of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as fair value hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been recognised immediately in the Consolidated income Statement.

MATURITY OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities inclusive of derivative financial assets at 31 December 2015 was as follows: 2015 2014 m m in one year or less 225.7 9.9 in more than one year but not more than two years 2.6 124.9 in more than two years but not more than five years 47.4 26.0 in more than five years 52.0 78.8 Total 327.7 239.6 The table above excludes trade payables of 234.4m 2014: 206.3m.
Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2015 as follows: 2015 2014 m m Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 160.0 250.0 Total 160.0 250.0 At 31 December 2015 the Group had 474m of committed facilities, of which 160m were undrawn as disclosed above.
Since 31 December 2015, a maximum of 166m has been drawn down against the 250m Revolving Credit Facility.
contractual maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities, derivative financial instruments, other financial assets, deferred consideration and cash and cash equivalents iFRS 7 requires disclosure of the maturity of the Groups remaining contractual financial liabilities.
The tables overleaf have been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial assets and liabilities including interest that will accrue to those assets and liabilities except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay the liability before its maturity.
Both the inclusion of future interest and the values disclosed being undiscounted results in the total position being different to that included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Given that this is a maturity analysis all trade payables and receivables including amongst other items payroll and sales tax accruals which are not classified as financial instruments have been included.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS iFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates: and ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
a Interest rate sensitivity The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish Zloty interest rates.
in order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

b Foreign currency sensitivity The Group is exposed to currency rate changes between Sterling and Euros, US Dollars and Polish Zloty.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% change in Sterling against each respective foreign currency to which the Group is exposed, indicating the likely impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Groups financial position.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.

Therefore, in order to present a complete analysis of the Groups exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, the exposure on the Groups total assets and liabilities has been disclosed.
The movements noted above are mainly attributable to: i retranslation of Euro interest flows: ii mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of effective cash flow and net investment hedges and retranslation of assets and liabilities under the scope of iFRS 7: iii retranslation of Euro profit streams: iv retranslation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities outside the scope of iFRS 7 and mark-to-market valuation changes in the fair value of effective cash flow and net investment hedges: and v retranslation of Polish Zloty profit streams.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which the properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub-lease agreements on a contract-by-contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 28.
Leasehold dilapidations This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of repair.
The provision is calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 28. contingent consideration Contingent consideration relates to the amounts due to vendors of completed acquisitions providing certain future profit targets are met.
The utilisation of the contingent consideration provision includes the recognition of 2.7m of loan notes payable within one year.
other amounts Other amounts relate principally to claims and warranty provisions.
The transfer of economic benefit is expected to be made between one and twenty three years time.
DEFERRED TAX The net deferred tax asset at the end of the year is analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Deferred tax assets 21.0 29.0 Deferred tax liabilities 18.2 12.1 Net deferred tax asset 2.8 16.9 summary of deferred tax The different components of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period are analysed below: Goodwill Property, Retirement and plant and Tax benefit intangibles equipment assets obligations Losses Other Total m m m m m m m At 31 December 2013 7.9 1.2 8.5 5.6 1.0 0.9 7.5 Credit charge to income 5.3 1.2 1.1 0.7 8.9 0.1 11.1 Credit to equity 1.7 0.5 2.2 Added on acquisition 3.1 0.2 3.3 Removed on disposal 0.4 0.4 Exchange differences 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Change of rate charged to equity 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2014 5.6 0.1 7.0 6.4 9.4 0.4 16.9 Credit charge to income 2.6 1.3 1.7 0.2 3.9 0.1 4.6 Charge to equity 0.2 0.1 0.3 Added on acquisition 8.4 0.2 0.1 8.5 Exchange differences 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 Change of rate charged to equity 0.7 0.7 At 31 December 2015 11.3 1.2 5.0 5.2 5.6 0.5 2.8 During 2015, the Group recognised deferred tax assets of 0.9m net relating to previously unrecognised trading losses incurred in prior periods in ireland 0.7m net and Belgium 0.2m net.
in prior periods these trading losses were not recognised on the grounds of uncertainty.
Following utilisation in the current and prior periods, the Directors now feel that the remaining amount is recoverable and therefore the asset has been recognised in full in the period.
The 0.7m net tax credit relating to historical trading losses in ireland has been recognised as a non-underlying credit in line with where the trading losses restructuring costs were previously recorded, whereas the 0.2m net tax credit relating to Belgium has been recorded as an underlying tax credit.
During 2014, the Group recognised deferred tax assets of 14.9m net relating to c. 72m gross of previously unrecognised excess non-trading losses incurred in 2008 associated with the derivative financial instruments and included within Other items in the Consolidated income Statement.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, c. 27m gross or 5.5m net of these non-trading losses were utilised, together with a prior year net tax credit of 0.7m c. 2.7m gross.
The deferred tax charge within the Consolidated income Statement for 2015 includes a credit of 0.8m 2014: 0.2m arising from the change in domestic tax rates in the countries in which the Group operates.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 3m 2014: 5m that have not been recognised on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The tax losses in The Netherlands of c. 2.6m expire after eight years.
The remaining tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 22m 2014: 18m relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Of these schemes, one 2014: one has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and five 2014: four are overseas book reserve schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTiNUED c pension schemes continued in The Netherlands, the Company participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry BPF HiBiN.
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under iAS 19, but is recognised in the Accounts as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SiGs share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified.
Therefore, the Groups annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan decreased to 105.3% as at 31 December 2015 2014: 112.2%.
No change was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% 2014: 22.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
in Belgium, the Company provides pensions for employees through a defined contribution scheme which, following a change in Belgian legislation, has a minimum guaranteed rate of return and is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under iAS 19.
The Company has insured its liabilities.
At 31 December 2015 the scheme has gross assets and liabilities of 0.4m 2014: nil.
The Groups total pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest was 7.8m 2014: 7.4m, of which a charge of 2.2m 2014: 1.9m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 5.6m 2014: 5.5m related to defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations in accordance with iAS 19 the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SiG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2013 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 131.4m and their actuarial value covered 90% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other five schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is re-insured by an external insurance company.
investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees Statement of investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
interest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
Consolidated income Statement charges The pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest of 0.7m 2014: 0.6m relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 2.2m 2014: 1.9m.
in accordance with iAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2015 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of iAS 19. investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising, and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The four overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.

in addition a deferred tax charge of 0.2m 2014: 0.7m has been recognised in the Consolidated income Statement.
A full reconciliation of the deferred tax movement is shown in Note 22.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income amounted to a loss of 37.7m 2014: 39.6m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 15.4m 2014: 19.4m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 8.4m 2014: 9.3m relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2015 2014 m m Pension liability at 1 January 28.7 25.5 Current service cost 1.5 1.3 Transfer to accruals 1.0 Payment of unfunded benefits 0.2 2.4 Contributions 3.5 3.4 Net finance cost 0.7 0.6 Actuarial gain loss 1.9 7.7 Effect of changes in exchange rates 0.5 0.6 Pension liability at 31 December 23.8 28.7 Contributions of approximately 3.4m are expected to be paid to defined benefit pension schemes during the annual period beginning 1 January 2016.
The Group is contracted to pay 2.5m per annum to January 2019.
The principal assumptions used for the iAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2015 2014 2013 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 2.5 2.5 2.5 Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 1.7 1.6 2.5 Rate of increase of LPi pensions in payment 3.0 2.9 3.3 Discount rate 3.9 3.6 4.5 inflation assumption 3.1 3.0 3.3 Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPi revaluation in deferment.
The life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 60 is 27.4 years 2014: 27.4 years.
The life expectancy on retirement at age 60 of a male employee currently aged 40 years is 29.2 years 2014: 29.1 years.
if the discount rate were to be increased decreased by 0.25%, this would decrease increase the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 7.1m.
if the rate of inflation increased decreased by 0.25% this would increase decrease the Groups gross pension scheme deficit by 1.6m.
if the life expectancy for employees increased decreased by one year the Groups gross pension scheme deficit would increase decrease by 6.3m.
