Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Cost or valuation Intangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised at fair value, amortised over their estimated useful lives and subject to impairment testing.
The Groups accounting policy on business combinations is included in note 25.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included inthe carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Programme and customer-related The most significant intangible assets recognised by the Group are in relation to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, mainly in respect of customer relationships and order backlog.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include: Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred toacquire and bring to use the specic software: Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identiable and unique software products controlled bythe Group, and that will probably generate economic benets exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Group-funded expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an expense asincurred: Research and development expenditure funded by the Group on development activities applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related overheads: and Patents, trademarks and licences.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a  basis over the life of the individual programme.
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Programme and customer-related up to 15 years Other intangible assets: Computer software licences acquired 2 to 5 years Software development costs 2 to 5 years Research and development expenditure up to 10 years Patents, trademarks and licences up to 20 years Other intangibles up to 10 years The Group has no indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments The carrying amounts of the Groups intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For intangible assets that are notyet available for use, impairment testing is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash-Generating Unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash-Generating Unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Impairment testing In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations use risk-adjusted future cash ow projections based on the Groups five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions applied.
The IBP process includes the use of historic experience, available government spending data and the Groups order backlog.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.47% 2014 7.12% adjusted for risks specic to the market in which the Cash-Generating Unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash ows.
The final year growth rate assumption in the value-in-use calculations is in the range 0% to 2%.

Other CGUs The remaining goodwill balance of 2.4bn 2014 2.4bn is allocated across multiple CGUs, including 0.6bn 2014 0.5bn in the Applied Intelligence CGU, with no individual CGU exceeding 10% of the Groups total goodwill balance.
The majority of the projected cash ows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash ow projections are based on the expectation of growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services in commercial markets.
Impairment goodwill In 2015, the impairment charge of 75m in the Intelligence & Security CGU reects lower growth assumptions.
In 2014, the impairment charge of 161m comprised the Platforms & Services US CGU, reecting performance issues at the US commercial shipbuilding business 87m and the agreement to sell the Groups 75% holding in BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa Pty Limited at aprice below its total carrying value 74m.
Impairment intangible assets In 2015, the impairment charge of 3m relates to the Cyber & Intelligence reporting segment.
In 2014, the impairment charge of 9m related to the Electronic Systems 1m, Cyber & Intelligence 4m and Platforms & Services US 4m reporting segments.
