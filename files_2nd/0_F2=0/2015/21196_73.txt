IFRS Financial statements 28 Deferred acquisition costs, other assets, prepayments and accrued income continued The balance of deferred acquisition costs for long-term business increased over 2015, as acquisition costs deferred during the year were partially offset by amortisation.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by 26 million 2014: 18 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 36 million 2014: 31 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.
At both 31 December 2015 and at 31 December 2014 the DAC balance has been restricted by the value of projected future profits and hence is more sensitive to changes in the value of those projected profits.
c Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income of 3,094 million 2014: 2,466 million, includes 88 million 2014: 81 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
29 Assets held to cover linked liabilities Certain unit-linked products have been classified as investment contracts, while some are included within the definition of an insurance contract.
The assets backing these unit-linked liabilities are included within the relevant balances in the consolidated statement of financial position, while the liabilities are included within insurance and investment contract provisions.
