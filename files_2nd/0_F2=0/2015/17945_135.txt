Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, including an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The plan is closedto new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2015 the aggregate level of contributions was $754 million 2014 $713 million and 2013 $ 597 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2016 is expected to be approximately $463 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next seven years is agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
Contractually committed funding therefore represents nine years of future contributions, which amounted to $4,374 million at 31 December 2015, of which $1,437 million relates to past service.
The surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2015.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main pension plan was as at 31 December 2014.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.

The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
The assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes an allowance for promotion-related salary growth.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows: Mortality assumptions Years 2015 2014 2013 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 28.5 28.3 27.8 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 31.0 30.9 30.7 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.5 29.4 29.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.9 31.8 32.2 The assets of the primary plan are held in a trust.
The primary objective of the trust is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to reduce the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increase the proportion held as bonds over time, with a view to better matching the asset portfolio with the pension liabilities.
During 2015, the plan switched 8% from equities to bonds.
In 2015, BPs primary plan in the UK adopted a more formal liability driven investment LDI approach for part of the portfolio, a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the impact of interest rate changes and inflation assumption changes on the projected benefit obligation.
The companys current asset allocation policy for the main plan is as follows: Asset category % Total equity including private equity 62 Bonds cash including LDI 31 Property real estate 7 The amounts invested under the LDI programme as at 31 December 2015 were $329 million of government issued nominal bonds and $6,421 million of index-linked bonds.
This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, proceeds from which are shown separately in the table below.
In addition, the primary UK plan entered into interest rate swaps in the year to offset the long-term fixed interest rate exposure for $2,651 million of the corporate bond portfolio.
The $17 million fair value of the swaps as at 31 December 2015 is included in other assets in the table below.
The primary plan does not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 204.

Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, inflation, salary growth and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A one-percentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2015 for the companys plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.
The effects shown for the expense in 2016 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
One additional year of longevity in the mortality assumptions would increase the 2016 pension and other post-retirement benefit expense by $40 million and the pension and other post-retirement benefit obligation at 31 December 2015 by $861 million.
