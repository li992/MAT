Gearing and loan-to-value The Groups capacity to borrow is primarily linked to the quantum of the property portfolio excluding assets held under finance leases.
Accordingly both gearing and loan-to value are calculated using the comparable measure of net borrowings.
This represents bank loans and outstanding bond liabilities at amortised cost.
The table overleaf shows the calculation of: gearing, being the ratio of net debt to total equity: adjusted gearing, being the ratio of net borrowings to total equity: and loan-to-value being the ratio of net borrowings to the property portfolio representing amounts that could be used as security for that debt.

Details of the Groups Performance Share Plan PSP are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The following table illustrates the movements in share options during the year.
As the PSP includes the grant of options at nil exercise price the weighted average prices below are calculated including and excluding the options under this plan.
The fair values calculated and the assumptions used are as follows: Charge to Income Risk-free Expected Dividend Share Statement interest rate volatility yield price 1 m % % % th 30 November 2015 2.0 0.41.1 37.656.9 1.1 1.233.99 th 30 November 2014 2.4 0.41.1 37.656.9 1.1 1.233.99 th 1 Based on the earlier of the 90 day average to 30 November 2011 or, for options granted after this date, the closing share price on the date of grant.
The fair value of the share incentive reserve in respect of share options outstanding at the year end was 5.2m 2014: 4.8m and included 1.8m 2014: 0.8m in respect of options that had vested at the year end.
In arriving at fair value it has been assumed that, when vested, shares options are exercised in accordance with historical trends.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 4.63 2014: 3.82.
The executive share options outstanding at the year end had a range of exercise prices between 1.75 and 4.74 2014: 1.75 and 3.75 with PSP options exercisable at between nil and 4.71 2014: nil and 1.52.
Outstanding options had a weighted average maximum remaining contractual life of nine years 2014: nine years.

Taxation continued d. Factors that may affect future tax charges As a property group, tax and its treatment is often an integral part of transactions.
The outcome of tax treatments, including tax planning, are recognised by the Group to the extent that the outcome is reasonably certain.
Where tax treatments have been challenged by HMRC, or management believe that there is a risk of such challenge, provision is made for the best estimate of potential exposure based on the information available at the Balance Sheet date.
The effective rate of tax for the year of 14% reflects the benefit of certain investment gains not being taxable because of indexation, recognition of tax losses and the property ownership structure within the Group.
As a result of proposed changes in the Groups property ownership structure the effective tax rate is expected to move towards, but remain below, the standard rate of tax as a result ofindexation on property revaluations together with land remediation and other property reliefs.

These assets represent head leases on cer tain investment property and are carried at the value recognised at inception less repayments of principal.
This does not include lease arrangements at Swansea University which are subject to revaluation.
Income producing properties have been valued using the investment method which involves applying a yield to rental income streams.
Inputs include equivalent yields, current rent and estimated rental value.
The resulting valuations are cross checked against the resulting initial yields and, for certain assets, the land value underpin if the assets were to be redeveloped.
Equivalent yields and estimated rental value are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the ranges used for each category of income producing properties is provided overleaf.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset, and an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.

Investment property continued Residential land is valued using the residual development method.
To derive the value of land the valuers will estimate the gross development value of completed residential units on a site from which deductions will be made for build costs including costs to remediate and service land, finance costs and an appropriate profit margin.
Sales prices, build costs and profit margins are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the ranges used are provided below.
All other factors being equal, a higher sales price would lead to an increase in the valuation of an asset, a higher profit margin would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset, and a decrease in the build costs would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
Commercial land is valued on a land value per acre less costs to remediate and service the land.
Land value per acre is considered to be an unobservable input and details of the ranges used are detailed below.

At 30 November 2015 the fair value of the Convertible Bonds was 104.1m with the change in fair value charged to the Income Statement.
The Convertible Bonds are listed on the Official List of the Channel Islands Security Exchange.
Following the issue of the Convertible Bonds the Group was in an over-hedged position with an excess of debt at fixed rate.
In order to reduce the level of fixed rate borrowings an interest rate derivative was entered into to swap the interest rate in the Convertible Bonds from a fixed rate of 2.875% to a floating rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 1.43% through to its third anniversary in March 2017.
The change in fair value of all of the above instruments is charged credited to the Income Statement as disclosed in note 4.

Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt as disclosed in note 14, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves andretained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or the Group net worth arising from movements in interest rates orother market prices.
Interest rate risk is the Groups principal market risk and is considered below.
Interest rate risk management: The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at variable interest rates.
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.
Interest rate sensitivity: The following table details the Groups sensitivity, after tax, to a 1% change in interest rates based on year end levels of debt.
2015 2014 1% increase in interest rates m m Interest on borrowings 2.1 1.2 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.5 1.0 0.6 0.2 2015 2014 1% decrease in interest rates m m Interest on borrowings 2.1 1.2 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.5 1.0 0.6 0.2 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due.
The credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with acceptable generally A and above credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 2.5m 2014: 1.6m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.

Pensions The Group operates a UK based pension scheme, the St. Modwen Pension Scheme, with both defined benefit and defined st contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1 September 2009, future accrual.
The Income Statement includes: a charge of 0.2m 2014: 0.2m for the defined benefit section: and a charge of 0.7m 2014: 0.6m for the defined contribution section.
The St. Modwen Pension Scheme is governed by the trustee company, St. Modwen Pensions Ltd.
It is regulated by the UK regulatory regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator.
th The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2014, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 38m, a funding level of 97% based on the Trustees proposed assumptions for technical provisions.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 5.6% pa post-retirement 3.8% pa Increase in pensions 2.7% pa Funding policy As the scheme is almost fully funded, the current schedule of contributions requires the Group to fund the Scheme to such th anextent as to cover administrative expenses only.
The expected contribution for year ended 30 November 2016 is expected st to be 0.2m, consistent with the current year 0.2m.
From 1 January 2015 the administrative expenses were met by St. Modwen Properties PLC.
th The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2015 on an IAS 19 basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS 19.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2015 2014 2013 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.1% 2.1% 2.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment th Pre 6 April 1997 benefits 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% th Post 5 April 1997 benefits 3.1% 3.1% 3.4% Discount rate 3.5% 3.6% 4.5% Inflation assumption 2.1% 2.1% 2.6% Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is st no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 145 245 4699 100164 165176 The mortality rates adopted are from the VITA Tables with CMI 2013 core projections and a long-term improvement of 1% pa with peaked short-term improvements and improvements remaining level at the oldest ages.
The resultant assumptions are, for example: th Average future life expectancy in years for a pensioner aged 65 at 30 November 2015: 23.1 male, 23.9 female.
th Average future life expectancy in years at age 65 for a non-pensioner aged 40 at 30 November 2015: 24.0 male, 26.2 female.

A 1 year increase in life expectancy would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.8m to 28.3m.
A 0.5% increase in the inflation rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.3m to 28.8m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in deferred pensions would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.3m to 27.8m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in pensions in payments would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.0m to 28.5m.
Defined benefit scheme risk factors The Group is exposed to a number of risks related to its defined benefit scheme, the most significant of which are detailed below.
Asset volatility Pension scheme liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields.
If the assets within the scheme deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate this will create or increase a deficit within the scheme.
This risk is reduced by holding a significant proportion of the scheme assets in matching assets bonds or similar.
As the scheme matures, it is anticipated that this proportion will increase to better match the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields will typically increase liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an appreciation in the value of scheme assets held in bonds.
Inflation risk As the pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities.
The asset portfolio includes a significant proportion of inflation linked bonds to reduce this risk.
Member longevity The pension obligations provide benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities and vice-versa.
Acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking In 2010, the Group entered into an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of Branston Properties Ltd Branston, of which Simon Clarke was a shareholder, at market value.
The price paid for the option was 0.1m with exercise contingent on the achievement of certain planning milestones in relation to land held by Branston.
nd Following achievement of these planning milestones the option was exercised by the Group on 22 May 2014 and 87.5% of the issued share capital of Branston was acquired.
A conditional agreement to acquire the remaining 12.5 % of the issued share nd capital, which was held by Simon Clarke, was also entered into on 22 May 2014.
Total consideration payable for the entire issued share capital of Branston was: 0.8m on completion: 0.1m payable on shareholder approval: nd 0.1m 12 months after completion which was paid on 22 May 2015: and Contingent consideration payable based on the level of future development gains achieved in respect of the land and property held by Branston.
Based on the provisional fair values detailed below, no contingent consideration has been recognised.
The consideration payable to Mr. Clarke under the conditional agreement equated to 12.5% of the amounts above.
As the consideration payable to Mr. Clarke was in excess of 100,000, the conditional agreement constituted a substantial property transaction with a director of the company under sections 190 and 191 of the Companies Act 2006.
As a result, the agreement was conditional, among other things, on approval of shareholders of St. Modwen Properties PLC: this approval was given at the th Companys Annual General Meeting held on 27 March 2015.
As required by IFRS 3 2008 Business Combinations, this acquisition resulted in the assets and liabilities of Branston being remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and the resulting negative goodwill arising of 2.1m credited to the Income Statement.
