Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future taxable profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised gross tax losses excluding capital losses and other temporary differences of 562 million 2014: 694 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 51 million will expire within the next 20 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised gross capital losses of 509 million 2014: 434 million.
These have no expiry date.
There are no temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at 31 December 2015 2014: nil.
As legislated in Finance No 2 Act 2015, which was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
The reductions in rate from 20% to 19% and then to 18% have been used in the calculation of the UKs deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2015.
In addition, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in France and Italy reflect the reduction in corporation tax rates from 38% to 34.43% effective 1 January 2016 and from 34.3% to 30.8% effective 1 January 2017 respectively.
The reduction in the future corporation tax rates in the UK, France and Italy has resulted in a reduction in the Groups net deferred tax liabilities of 120 million, comprising a 82 million credit included in the income statement and a 38 million credit included in the statement of comprehensive income.
