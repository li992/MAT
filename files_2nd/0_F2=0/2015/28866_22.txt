What we have audited The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and parent company balance sheets as at 31 December 2015, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated and parent company cash flow statements, the accounting policies and the related Notes 1 to 40 on the consolidated financial statements, the related Notes 1 to 15 on the parent company financial statements and the information identified as audited in the Capital and risk management section of the Business review.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB As explained in the accounting policies, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern and the directors assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group As required by the UK Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting on page 89 and the directors statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report on page 32.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: the directors confirmation on page 32 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity: the disclosures on pages 30 to 31 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated: the directors statement on page 89 about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Groups ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements: the directors explanation on page 32 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties.
However, because not all future events and conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Councils Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

For individually assessed loans we selected a sample of loans and, where we deemed them to be impaired, tested the estimation of the future expected cash flows from customers including from realisation of collateral held.
This work involved assessing the work performed by external experts used by the Group to value the collateral or to assess the estimates of future cash flows.
In some cases we used our own industry experts, particularly in respect of commercial real estate and shipping loans, to assess the appropriateness of valuations and estimates used by the Group.
Where we determined that a more appropriate assumption or input in provision measurement could be made, we recalculated the provision on that basis and compared the results in order to assess whether there was any indication of error or management bias.

We also assessed and met with external advisors to discuss the advice received by the Group in respect of the rights of pension trustees.

had been made to the affected databases and IT application systems: and Assessed the design and operating effectiveness of any controls that mitigated the identified risks.
In addition and where appropriate we extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures.
The description of the risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Group Audit Committee discussed on pages 51 to 54.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 300 million 2014 - 300 million, which was calculated as 0.6% 2014 - 0.5% of the total equity of the Group.
This represented 25% of the Groups loss for the year 2014 - 11% of the Groups loss.
Our materiality in both 2015 and 2014 was based on the equity of the Group given the significant volatility of the Groups profits and losses in recent years.
We agreed with the Group Audit Committee that we would report all audit differences in excess of 15 million, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Group Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
257 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc An overview of the scope of our audit The scope of our Group audit was determined by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope on the components of the audit that have most significance to the financial statements.
The significant components of our audit are consistent with the operating segments identified in the financial statements together with the central functions of the Group including Finance both in the UK and overseas, Treasury and Services.
A number of these components consist of a number of different operations with audit work performed in different countries.
Full scope audits were performed of the Groups operations in 6 countries, and a further 15 countries were subject to an audit of specified account balances or specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Groups operations at those locations.
The audit work performed across the 21 countries accounted for 98% 2014 - 99% of the Groups total assets and 90% 2014 - 94% of its total revenue.
The Group audit team sent component auditors detailed instructions on audit procedures to be undertaken and the information to be reported back to the Group audit team.
Regular contact was maintained throughout the course of the audit with key component auditors which included holding Group planning meetings, maintaining regular communications on the status of the audits and continuing with a programme of planned visits designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visited each significant component audit team a number of times during the year.

A single bank-wide programme has been established to implement the necessary changes in the modelling of credit loss parameters, and the underlying credit management and financial processes: this programme is led jointly by Risk and Finance.
The inclusion of loss allowances on all financial assets will tend to result in an increase in overall impairment balances when compared with the existing basis of measurement under IAS 39.

The defined benefit obligation is attributable to the different classes of scheme members in the following proportions Main scheme : 2015 2014 % % Active 17.5 18.8 Deferred 41.9 41.0 Pensioner 40.6 40.2 100.0 100.0 The table below sets out the sensitivities of the present value of defined benefit obligations at 31 December to a change in the principal actuarial assumptions.

The sensitivity to pension liabilities is the difference between these calculations.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
To eliminate this deficit, RBS agreed to pay annual additional contributions of 650 million from 2014 to 2016 and 450 million indexed in line with inflation from 2017 to 2023.
These contributions are in addition to regular annual contributions of approximately 270 million in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefits as well as contributions to meet the expenses of running the scheme.
In January 2016, RBS sought regulatory approval to accelerate the settlement of the outstanding additional contributions of 4.2 billion and it entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the trustee of the Main scheme which, among other things, will bring forward the date of the next triennial funding valuation to no later than 31 December 2015.
The trustee of the Main scheme is responsible for setting the actuarial assumptions used in the triennial funding valuation having taken advice from the Scheme Actuary.
These represent the trustees prudent estimate of the future experience of the Main scheme taking into account the covenant provided by RBS and investment strategy of the scheme.
They are agreed with RBS and documented in the Statement of Funding Principles.
The key assumption methodology used at the 31 March 2013 valuation is set out below: Principal actuarial assumptions Discount rate Fixed interest swap yield curve plus 1.5% per annum at all durations Inflation assumption Retail price index RPI swap yield curve Rate of increase in pensions in payment RPI floor 0%, cap 5% : Limited price indexation LPI 0,5 swap yield curve Post retirement mortality assumptions: Longevity at age 60 for current pensioners years Male 28.8 Female 30.8 Longevity at age 60 for future pensioners currently aged Male 30.7 40 years Female 32.9 5 Auditors remuneration Amounts paid to the Group's auditors for statutory audit and other services are set out below.
All audit-related and other services are approved by the Group Audit Committee and are subject to strict controls to ensure the external auditors independence is unaffected by the provision of other services.
The Group Audit Committee recognises that for certain assignments the auditors are best placed to perform the work economically: for other work the Group selects the supplier best placed to meet its requirements.
The Groups auditors are permitted to tender for such work in competition with other firms where the work is permissible under audit independence rules.
The analysis of auditors remuneration is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Fees payable for the audit of the Groups annual accounts 4.0 4.0 Fees payable to the auditor and its associates for other services to the Group - the audit of the companys subsidiaries 19.3 24.2 - audit-related assurance services 1 4.8 4.8 Total audit and audit-related assurance services fees 28.1 33.0 Taxation compliance services 0.4 0.3 Taxation advisory services 0.1 0.1 Other assurance services 0.9 1.2 Corporate finance services 2 1.1 1.7 Consulting services 0.1 Total other services 2.5 3.4 Fees payable to the auditor and its associates in respect of audits of associated pension schemes 0.5 0.4 Total 31.1 36.8 Notes: 1 Comprises fees of 0.8 million 2014 - 0.9 million in relation to reviews of interim financial information, 2.5 million 2014 - 2.5 million in respect of reports to the Groups regulators in the UK and overseas, 0.4 million 2014 - 0.3 million in respect of internal controls assurance and 1.1 million 2014 - 1.1 million in relation to non-statutory audit opinions.

The Finance No 2 Act 2015 restricts the rate at which tax losses are given credit in future periods to the main rate of UK corporation tax rate, excluding the Banking Surcharge 8% rate introduced by this Act.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2015 take into account the reduced rates in respect of tax losses and non-banking temporary differences and where appropriate, the banking surcharge inclusive rate in respect of other banking temporary differences.
2 Prior year tax adjustments for 2015 include releases of tax provisions that reflect the reduction of exposures in countries where RBS is ceasing operations in line with the strategy to become a smaller, simpler UK focused bank.
The prior year tax adjustment also reflects adjustments to reflect submitted tax computations in the UK and overseas and a further prior year tax credit in respect of tax losses arising in the Belfast Branch of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited reflecting UK tax law changes and European Court of Justice decisions on the surrender of tax losses.

Financial instruments carried at fair value - valuation hierarchy The following tables show financial instruments carried at fair value on the Groups balance sheet by valuation hierarchy level 1, level 2 and level 3 and related level 3 sensitivities.
Examples include G10 government securities, listed equity shares, certain exchange-traded derivatives and certain US agency securities.
Level 2: valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using: a quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active: or b valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuations are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
Level 2 instruments included non-G10 government securities, most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, less liquid listed equities, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, and certain money market securities and loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.
Level 3: instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation, is not based on observable market data.
Level 3 instruments primarily include cash instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, certain emerging markets instruments, unlisted equity shares, certain residual interests in securitisations, CDOs, other mortgage-backed products and less liquid debt securities, certain structured debt securities in issue, and OTC derivatives where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs such as certain credit and exotic derivatives.
No gain or loss is recognised on the initial recognition of a financial instrument valued using a technique incorporating significant unobservable data.
2 Transfers between levels are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the quarter in which the instruments were transferred.
There were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2.
3 For an analysis of derivatives by type of contract refer to Capital and risk management - Balance sheet analysis - derivatives.
4 The determination of an instruments level cannot be made at a global product level as a single product type can be in more than one level.
For example, a single name corporate credit default swap could be in Level 2 or Level 3 depending on whether the reference counterpartys obligations are liquid or illiquid.
5 Sensitivity represents the favourable and unfavourable effect on the income statement or the statement of comprehensive income due to reasonably possible changes to valuations using reasonably possible alternative inputs in RBSs valuation techniques or models.
Level 3 sensitivities are calculated at a sub-portfolio level and hence these aggregated figures do not reflect the correlation between some of the sensitivities.
In particular, for some portfolios, the sensitivities may be negatively correlated where a downward movement in one asset would produce an upward movement in another, but due to the additive presentation above, this correlation cannot be shown.
301 Notes on the consolidated accounts Valuation techniques The table below shows a breakdown of valuation techniques and the ranges for those unobservable inputs used in valuation models and techniques that have a material impact on the valuation of Level 3 financial instruments.
The table excludes unobservable inputs where the impact on valuation is less significant.
Movements in the underlying input may have a favourable or unfavourable impact on the valuation depending on the particular terms of the contract and the exposure.
For example an increase in the credit spread of a bond would be favourable for the issuer and unfavourable for the note holder.
Whilst RBS indicates where it considers that there are significant relationships between the inputs, these inter-relationships will be affected by macro economic factors including interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity index levels.

A higher credit spread would indicate that the underlying instrument has more credit risk associated with it.
Consequently, investors require a higher yield to compensate for the higher risk.
The discount rate comprises credit spread or margin plus the benchmark rate: it is used to value future cash flows.
2 Price and yield: There may be a range of prices used to value an instrument that may be a direct comparison of one instrument or portfolio with another or, movements in a more liquid instrument may be used to indicate the movement in the value of a less liquid instrument.
The comparison may also be indirect in that adjustments are made to the price to reflect differences between the pricing source and the instrument being valued, for example different maturity, credit quality, seniority or expected pay-outs.
Similarly to price, an instruments yield may be compared with other instruments yields either directly or indirectly.
3 Recovery rate: reflects market expectations about the return of principal for a debt instrument or other obligations after a credit event or on liquidation.
Recovery rates tend to move conversely to credit spreads.
4 Valuation: for private equity investments, risk may be measured by beta, estimated by looking at past prices of similar stocks and from valuation statements where valuations are usually derived from earnings measures such as EBITDA.
5 Correlation: measures the degree by which two prices or other variables are observed to move together.
If they move in the same direction there is positive correlation: if they move in opposite directions there is negative correlation.
Correlations typically include relationships between: default probabilities of assets in a basket a group of separate assets, exchange rates, interest rates and other financial variables.
6 Volatility: a measure of the tendency of a price to change with time.
7 Level 3 structured notes issued of 0.5 billion are not included in the table above as valuation is consistent with the valuation of the embedded derivative component.
8 RBS does not have any material liabilities measured at fair value that are issued with an inseparable third party credit enhancement.
9 The table above excludes unobservable inputs where the impact on valuation is less significant.
For example, an increase in the credit spread of a bond would be favourable for the issuer but unfavourable for the note holder.
Whilst RBS indicates where it considers that there are significant relationships between the inputs, their inter-relationships will be affected by macro economic factors including interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity index levels.

Citizens by 31 December 2016, RBS disposed of 30% of its interest in Citizens during the second half of 2014 primarily through an initial public offering in the USA and disposed of further tranches of 28% in March 2015, 21% in August 2015 and the remaining 21% in October 2015 to complete the divestment.
Consequently, Citizens is classified as a disposal group and treated as a discontinued operation until October 2015.
From 3 August 2015, Citizens was an associated undertaking.
On reclassification to disposal groups at 31 December 2014, the carrying value of Citizens exceeded its fair value less costs to sell Fair Value Hierarchy level 2: based on the quoted price of shares in Citizens Financial Group, Inc. by 3,994 million and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the disposal group was adjusted by this amount.
This loss was attributed to the intangible assets of the disposal group.
The gain on disposal in 2015 comprised 248 million on the derecognition of assets and liabilities, and 989 million in respect of reserves reclassified in accordance with IFRS.

Of the 4.3 billion cumulative charge, 3.9 billion relates to redress and 0.4 billion to administrative expenses.
The principal assumptions underlying RBSs provision in respect of PPI sales are: assessment of the total number of complaints that RBS will receive: the proportion of these that will result in redress: and the average cost of such redress.
The number of complaints has been estimated from an analysis of RBSs portfolio of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld the uphold rate have been established based on recent experience, guidance in FSA policy statements and the expected rate of responses from proactive customer contact.
The average redress assumption is based on recent experience and FSA calculation rules.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the provision to changes in the principal assumptions all other assumptions remaining the same.
Sensitivity Consequential Change in change in Actual Current assumption provision Assumption to date assumptions % m Single premium book past business review take up rate 55% 56% -5 -55 Uphold rate 1 91% 89% -5 -35 Average redress 1,677 1,638 -5 -36 Note: 1 Uphold rates exclude claims where no PPI policy was held.
Interest that will be payable on successful complaints has been included in the provision as has the estimated cost to RBS of administering the redress process.
There are uncertainties as to the eventual cost of redress which will depend on actual complaint volumes, take up and uphold rates and average redress costs.
Assumptions related to these are inherently uncertain and the ultimate financial impact may be different from the amount provided.
We continue to monitor the position closely and refresh the underlying assumptions.
Background information in relation to PPI claims is given in Note 30.
319 Notes on the consolidated accounts 2 RBS has a provision of 149 million for its liability in respect of the sale of Interest Rate Hedging Products IRHP, having an incurred cost of 1.5 billion.
The provision includes redress that will be paid to customers, consequential loss including interest on customer redress, the cost to RBS of exiting the hedging positions and the cost of undertaking the review.
In 2015, RBS increased its provision by 68 million 2014 - 185 million: 2013 - 550 million, principally reflecting a marginal increase in redress experience compared to expectations and the cost of a small number of consequential loss claims over and above interest offered as part of basic redress payments.
The outcomes of all cases have now been agreed with the independent skilled person appointed to review all decisions.
The cumulative charge for IRHP is 1.5 billion, of which 1.1 billion relates to redress and 0.4 billion to administrative expenses.
The principal assumptions underlying RBSs provision are: the proportion of relevant customers with interest rate caps that will ask to be included in the review: the type of consequential loss claims that will be received: movements in market rates that will impact the cost of closing out legacy hedging positions: and the cost of the review.
Uncertainties remain over the number of transactions that will qualify for redress and the nature and cost of that redress, including the cost of consequential loss claims.
Background information in relation to Interest Rate Hedging Products claims is given in Note 30.
3 RBS has provided for other customer redress, primarily in relation to investment advice in retail and private banking, 100 million 2014 - 190 million and packaged accounts, 157 million 2014 - 150 million.
4 RBS is party to certain legal proceedings and regulatory investigations and continues to co-operate with a number of regulators.
All such matters are periodically reassessed with the assistance of external professional advisers, where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of RBS incurring a liability and to evaluate the extent to which a reliable estimate of any liability can be made.
An additional charge of 361 million was booked in 2015 2014 - 820 million: 2013 - 124 million, primarily relating to investigations into the foreign exchange market, regulatory fines in connection with the June 2012 technology incident and other conduct and regulatory matters.
Details of these investigations and a discussion of the nature of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 30.
5 Arising out of its normal business operations, RBS is party to legal proceedings in the United Kingdom, the United States and other jurisdictions.
An additional charge of 2.2 billion was recorded in 2015 as a result of greater levels of certainty on expected outcomes, primarily in respect of mortgage-backed securities and securities-related litigation following third party settlements and regulatory decisions.
Detailed descriptions of RBSs legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties are given in Note 30.
6 The majority of property provisions relate to vacant leasehold property and comprise the present value of the shortfall between rentals payable and rentals receivable from sub-letting.
Other provisions include restructuring provisions of 483 million principally termination benefits.

The company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and are presented in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The company is incorporated in the UK and registered in Scotland.
The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Recognised financial assets and financial liabilities in fair value hedges are adjusted for changes in fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged.
The accounting policies that are applicable to the company are included in RBS accounting polices which are set out on pages 267 to 280 of the consolidated financial statements, except that it has no policy regarding Basis of consolidation and that the companys investments in its subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment.
Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty The reported results of the company are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements.
The judgements and assumptions involved in the companys accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are those involved in assessing the impairment if any in its investments in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is any indication that its investment in a subsidiary is impaired.
If any such indication exists, the company undertakes an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary with its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an investment in a subsidiary is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgments: the choice of appropriate discount and growth rates: and the estimation of fair value.
