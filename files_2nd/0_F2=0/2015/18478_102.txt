Acquisitions a Acquisitions in the year The Group made three individually immaterial acquisitions, in connection with which provisional goodwill of US$53m was recognised, based on the fair value of the net assets acquired of US$23m.
Net assets acquired, goodwill and acquisition consideration are analysed below.
US$m Intangible assets: Customer and other relationships 13 Software development 12 Marketing related assets 1 Intangible assets 26 Trade and other receivables 3 Cash and cash equivalents 3 Trade and other payables 4 Net deferred tax liabilities 5 Total identifiable net assets 23 Goodwill 53 Total 76 Satisfied by: Cash 61 Fair value of equity interest held prior to business combination 12 Recognition of non-controlling interest 1 Deferred and contingent consideration 2 Total 76 These provisional fair values contain amounts which will be finalised no later than one year after the dates of acquisition.
Provisional amounts have been included at 31 March 2015, as a consequence of the timing and complexity of the acquisitions.
Goodwill represents the synergies, assembled workforces and future growth potential of the businesses.
The goodwill arising of US$53m is not currently deductible for tax purposes.
The contingent consideration arrangement requires payments to the former owners of an acquired company based on the achievement of revenue targets.
Payments are due at the end of each of the first three years following acquisition and the potential amount that the Group could be required to make under this arrangement is between US$nil and US$13m.
The fair value of this consideration has been estimated by applying the income approach and during the year an increase of US$7m has been recognised in the Group income statement based on latest forecasts of business performance.
This is a Level 3 fair value measurement.
There have been no other material gains, losses, error corrections or other adjustments recognised in the year that relate to current year acquisitions.
