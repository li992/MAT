Notes to the Company Financial Statements i Principal Accounting Policies of the Company Accounting Principles The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives which are stated at fair value in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of Preparation No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 2 and 3 of the Companies Act 2006.
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 42,514,000 2014: 50,320,000.
Fees paid to KPMG LLP and its associates for audit and non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual financial statements of Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC because the Group financial statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
Where the consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking includes shares in the Company to which the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 apply, cost represents the nominal value of the shares issued together with the fair value of any additional consideration given and costs.
Where investments are denominated in foreign currencies, they are treated as monetary assets and revalued at each balance sheet date.
Intangible Assets Product rights that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Product rights are amortised over the period of their useful lives.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and options is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Hedging Cash Flow Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised as profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised.
In other cases, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Cash Flow Statement As the ultimate holding company of the Group, the Company has relied upon the exemption in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 1 Revised not to present a cash flow statement as part of its financial statements.

Dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised when either received in cash or applied to reduce a creditor balance with the subsidiary.
Interest-bearing Borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Related Parties Under FRS 8 the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose related party transactions with other Group undertakings as they are all wholly owned within the Group and are included in the Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Consolidated Financial Statements.

Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account as incurred.
ii Share-based Payment Transactions The Company operates a number of equity settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The Company also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and Senior Executives.
The fair value of shares or options granted is recognised as an employee expense on a straight-line basis in the profit and loss account with a corresponding movement in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares or options the vesting period.
The fair value of the shares or options granted is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares or options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account is adjusted to take into account an estimate of the number of shares or options that are expected to vest together with an adjustment to reflect the number of shares or options that actually do vest except where forfeiture is only due to market-based conditions not being achieved.
The fair values of grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The fair values of options granted under all other share option schemes have been determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of share-based payments at the date of exercise are treated as cash settled awards and revalued to market price at each balance sheet date.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recharges the expense to those subsidiaries.

Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply and have been substantively enacted in the periods in which the timing differences reverse and is provided in respect of all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Financial Guarantee Contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
