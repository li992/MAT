2 Graham Chipchases personal objectives in 2014 were measured against strategic objectives including emerging market opportunities and implementation of strategy: and non financial objectives including meeting the Groups safety and environmental targets, developing succession and diversity plans, and leading the executive leadership team.
The Committee assessed that Graham Chipchase exceeded these objectives during 2014.
3 David Robbies personal objectives in 2014 were measured against strategic objectives including executing emerging market opportunities, implementation of strategy and cash generation: and non financial objectives including development of the Group finance function and engagement, and best performance of the Group and sector structure.
David Robbie met all his personal objectives in 2014 but, in awarding his bonus, note was taken of his medical absence and thus the overall bonus was reduced from 531,592 to 451,853.
The information in this report relating to long term incentives has been disclosed on the basis that each award will complete its respective measurement period although this will be impacted in the event of the Ball offer completing.
Full details of the long term incentive arrangements agreed with Ball have been disclosed in the Rule 2.7 announcement dated 19 February 2015 and, once the regulatory clearances are substantially finalised, the vesting details will be disclosed in the scheme document to be posted to shareholders requesting approval of the scheme of arrangement to give effect to the Ball offer.
Long term incentive outcome 2015 audited information Long term incentive awards granted in 2013 through the LTIP completed their measurement period on 31 December 2015.
Vesting of the awards was dependent on three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period: EPS growth, relative TSR compared with the largest 150 companies excluding investment trusts by market capitalisation within the FTSE All Share Index, and ROCE.
There is no retest provision.
The awards were granted with the right to the payment in cash of a dividend equivalent on the number of shares that vest based on the notional value of the dividends paid between the date of grant and the date of transfer of the shares.
Further details, including vesting schedules and performance against each of the measures is provided in the table below.
Threshold Maximum vesting vesting Measure Weighting 25% 100% Outcome Vesting EPS growth 33% 5% pa 12% pa 3.7% pa 0% Relative TSR 33% Median Upper Below 0% quartile median 1 ROCE 33% 14% 16% 15% 20.8% Overall LTIP vesting 20.8% 1 The outcome reflects three year average ROCE achievement.
For each of the three performance measures, the vesting below threshold is nil.
Between threshold and maximum, the vesting is calculated on a straight line basis between 25% and 100%, and the vesting is capped at 100% for achievements at or above maximum.
Each executive directors award is expected to vest on 3 April 2016.
For the purpose of calculating a single total figure for remuneration, the value of the LTIP vesting in 2016 has been estimated as set out below.
