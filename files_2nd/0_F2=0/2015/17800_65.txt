Notes to the financial statements 28 Post-employment benefit obligations continued Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and staff turnover.

If the discount rate is 100 basis points higher the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $7.0 million.
If the discount rate is 100 basis points lower the defined benefit obligation would increase by $8.2 million.
If the expected salary growth increases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would increase by $7.5 million.
If the expected salary growth decreases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $6.5 million.
If the staff turnover increases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $0.1 million.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to doso.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balance after offset : 2015 2014 $m $m Deferred tax assets 124.6 104.6 Deferred tax liabilities 1,076.2 979.8 Net deferred tax balances 951.6 875.2 At 31 December 2015, the Group had unused tax losses of $9.9 million 2014 $14.3 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of $2.7 million has been recognised in respect of these losses in 2015 2014 $1.5 million.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2015, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $4,963.9 million 2014 $4,520.4 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is likely that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
The deferred tax balance of $951.6 million 2014 $875.2 million includes $965.0 million 2014 $951.6 million due in more than one year.
All amounts are shown as non-current on the face of the balance sheet as required by IAS 12.
