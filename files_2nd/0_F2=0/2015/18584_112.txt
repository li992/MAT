The uncertainties preventing recognition of these losses will not be resolved until 2017 and a corresponding provision was created against their use.
The net movement on provisions was reduced to 23million by the resolution of a long standing dispute through a bilateral negotiation between tax authorities.
Management tax rate The tax charge arising on management profits of subsidiaries of 544 million 2014: 539 million was 133 million 2014: 121million charge giving an effective tax rate of 24% 2014: 22%.
Significant judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic tax positions.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.

Other deferred tax arises mainly in relation to items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period than the income or expense is accrued in the accounts.
Other deferred tax assets include 85 million relating to derivatives 2014: 47 million.
e Unrecognised deferred tax assets Certain deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the basis that the Groups ability to utilise them is uncertain as shown below.

If these earnings were remitted in full, tax of 18 million 2014: 16 million would be payable.
f Changes in UK tax rate A reduction in the mainstream rate of UK corporation tax from 21% to 20% took effect from April 2015 which gives rise to an effective rate of 20.25% for the year.
A further reduction to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020 have been substantively enacted.
UK temporary differences are measured at the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
g Franked investment income litigation Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Groups EU community law rights.
The most recent High Court judgement in the case was published in December 2014.
Although the judgement was broadly positive, it is anticipated that HMRC will appeal at least some of the technical points decided.
GKN has received payments from HMRC in respect of the case, principally interest, which have been recognised as received.
In August 2015, the Group agreed a settlement of 12 million with HMRC in respect of the Foreign Income Dividends element of the claim.
This resulted in an interest receipt, net of restitutional and other charges, of 4 million.
The continuing complexity of the remaining case and uncertainty over the issues raised and in particular which points HMRC may seek to appeal means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty.
