N NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS OTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUE CONTINUE DD 20.
Deferred tax continued Unrecognised temporary differences Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the following temporary differences due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions.
6.0m of the losses will expire by 31 December 2016: 20.0m will expire between 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2020.
There is no expiry date associated with the remaining tax losses of 9.4m.
2015 2014 m m Tax losses 35.4 6.6 Other temporary differences 1.3 2.8 36.7 9.4 The UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 20% from 21% with effect from 1 April 2015.
Further phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted in the UK Finance No.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting these earnings to the UK.
However, 47.9m 2014: 42.4m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 2.3m 2014: 2.3m, of which only 1.0m 2014: 0.4m has been provided for as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
