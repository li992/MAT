FINANCIALS Notes to the Annual Financial Statements Heading For the 53 weeks ended 4 July 2015 1 Segmental reporting The Group has one reportable segment, retail of homewares in the UK.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc.
Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a monthly basis.
Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.

Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were announced in the Chancellors Budget on 8 July 2015.
These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
As the changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date their effects are not included in these financial statements.
The overall effect of these changes, if they had applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by an additional 190k and increase the tax expense for the period by 117k.

On 11 February 2015 the Company announced the return of capital to shareholders via a B C share scheme.
Accordingly: On 10 March 2015 128,710,152 0.001 pence B shares were issued.
A dividend of 70 pence per B share was declared on 11 March 2015.
Following the declaration of the B share dividend, the B shares automatically converted into deferred shares and were purchased by UBS and subsequently purchased from UBS by the Company, in each case for an aggregate sum of 0.001 penny, and cancelled.
The C shares were purchased by UBS on 11 March 2015 for 70 pence per share.
The C shares purchased by UBS were in turn purchased from UBS by the Company and then cancelled.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares note 20.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.

com Stock code: DNLM 100 FINANCIALS Heading 16 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business is in place.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as foreign exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to 25m for any individual party.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by payments in advance of goods to overseas suppliers.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
The Groups available facilities can be found in note 17.
All of the Groups derivative financial liabilities are due to settle within 24 months of the balance sheet date Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges.
The Directors do not consider that future changes in interest rates are likely to cause a material direct impact on profitability.
Foreign currency risk All of the Groups revenues are in sterling.
The majority of purchases are also in sterling, but some goods purchased direct from overseas suppliers are paid for in US dollars, accounting for just under 20% of stock purchases in the period ended 4 July 2015.
The Group uses various means to cover its exposure to US dollars: holding US dollar cash balances: taking our forward contracts for the purchase of US dollars: and entering into forward rate contracts, All the Groups foreign exchange transactions are designed to satisfy US dollar denominated liabilities.
The maximum level of hedging coverage which will be undertaken is 100% of anticipated expenditure on a three month horizon, stepping down to 75% on a nine to 12 month horizon.
Coverage beyond 12 months is minimal.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the period end were $281,000 2014: $150,000.
During the period the Group entered into exchange rate swaps for $137.0m to sell sterling and buy US dollars.
These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
During the period the mark to market gain on foreign currency hedging instruments taken to equity was 0.9m 2014: 3.3m loss.
At the balance sheet date the Group had 176 swap contracts outstanding with an aggregate maximum value of $134.0m.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group could seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposure is to the US dollar.
The Directors believe that an increase or decrease of 10% in the US dollar to sterling exchange rates would not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The US dollar period end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.5603 2014: 1.7016.
Strengthening and weakening of sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts are sums required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the period.
Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 4 July 2015 101 Notes to the Annual Financial Statements CONTINUED For the 53 weeks ended 4 July 2015 16 Financial risk management continued Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, based on observable market data.
Gains on cash flow hedges during the period amounted to 2,080,000 2014: loss 1,607,000.
Capital management The Company considers equity plus debt as the capital.
The Boards objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to optimise returns to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.
During the period, the Board reviewed its policy on capital structure and dividends.
The original policy was established at the time of the flotation of the Company and in the Boards opinion has ceased to reflect the scale of the business and its consistent track record of cash generation over many years.
Accordingly, the Board determined that the Group will operate with a modest amount of leverage such that net debt should fall within the range of 0.25 to 0.75 times the last 12 months EBITDA.
In order to fund the ongoing debt, the Group has entered into an arrangement with a syndicate of three major banks for the provision of a 150m revolving credit facility, expiring on 9 February 2020.

com Stock code: DNLM 104 FINANCIALS Heading 21 Share-based payments As at 4 July 2015, the Group operated three share award plans: a Dunelm Group Share Option Plan GSOP b Dunelm Group Savings Related Share Option Plan Sharesave c Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP There were 3,692 exercisable options in total under these schemes as at 4 July 2015 2014: 2,844.
On 30 June 2015, all non-exercisable share options were modified in order to protect option holders from the possible dilution to the value of their options following the return of capital to shareholders made in March 2015.
HMRC guidance requires that any adjustment made to approved options results in the total market value of shares subject to option immediately prior to and immediately after the adjustment being substantially the same: and the exercise price payable under the option immediately prior to and immediately after the adjustment being substantially the same.
This was done by increasing the number of shares by 6.79% and decreasing the exercise price per share by 6.36%.
The same methodology was applied to all option schemes, including LTIP.
This amendment had no impact on the share based payment charge for the year.
The fair value of options granted during the period was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
Full disclosures have not been given based on the immateriality of the figures.
a Dunelm Group Share Option Plan The GSOP was established in December 2003.
Options have a vesting period of three years from date of grant and a maximum life of ten years.
All grants have an exercise price equal to market price at date of grant.
These grants are dependent on the level of growth in the Groups EPS relative to RPI as well as continuing employment with the Group.
The number and weighted average exercise price of options under the GSOP at 4 July 2015 were as follows: Weighted Number of Weighted Number of average shares under average shares under exercise price option exercise price option 2015 2015 2014 2014 Outstanding at beginning of the period 814.6p 139,900 497.3p 153,565 Granted during the period -- 876.5p 115,377 Adjusted during the period 766.9p 7,741 -- Exercised during the period -- 420.0p 100,000 Lapsed during the period 795.6p 25,860 741.2p 29,042 Outstanding at end of the period 815.6p 121,781 814.6p 139,900 b Dunelm Group Savings Related Share Option Plan The Sharesave scheme was established in 2006 and is open to all staff with eligible length of service.
