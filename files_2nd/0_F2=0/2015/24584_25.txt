Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Hargreaves Lansdown plc the Company and ultimate parent of the Group is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is One College Square South, Anchor Road, Bristol, BS1 5HL, United Kingdom.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretation Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as discussed on page 65.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported or the accounting policies in these financial statements: IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, which establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entity an entity that controls one or more other entities to present consolidated financial statements.
It defines the principle of control, and establishes controls as the basis for consolidation.
It sets out how to apply the principle of control to identify whether an investor controls an investee and therefore must consolidate the investee.
It also sets out the accounting requirements for the preparation of consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and other off balance sheet vehicles.
This has required the Group to make additional disclosures regarding the interest in the HLFM Multi-Manager funds that it manages, as the funds are considered to be unconsolidated structured entities.
The disclosure has been made in Note 29.
Other new standards that were adopted during the year but had no impact on the financial statements are as follow: - IFRIC 21 Levies - IFRS 11 Joint arrangements - IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements - IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and joint ventures - Amendment to IAS 36, Impairment of assets - Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not yet been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : - IFRS 9 Financial instruments - Amendments to IAS 28 revised 2011 Investments in associates and - IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers joint ventures - Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint arrangements - Annual improvements to IFRS 2012 - 2014 cycle - Amendments to IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment - Amendments to IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements - Amendments to IAS 38 Intangible assets - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements The Directors are currently investigating whether the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Accounting policies as shown below have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
76 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and subsidiary undertakings investees controlled by the Group made up to 30 June 2015.
The Group controls an investee when it has power over an investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more elements of control.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are reviewed for impairment at least annually as a matter of course, and whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs which indicates potential impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS on 1 July 2005 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 30 June 1997 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is primarily classified as recurring, transactional or other.
Recurring revenue principally comprises the revenue streams of renewal income, management fees, platform fees and interest income on client money, while transactional revenue principally comprises initial commission on stockbroking transactions.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Recurring Renewal income is earned from fund management groups and is recognised on an accruals basis calculated according to the level of assets under the administration, or agency, of the Group primarily at each month-end.
Management and platform fees are paid by clients and are recognised on an accruals basis calculated according to the level of applicable assets where fees apply at each month-end.
The interest income on client money balances is the net interest margin earned by the Group and is accrued on a time basis, according to the client money balances under administration and by reference to the effective interest rate applicable.
Transactional The Groups stockbroking and unit trust management subsidiaries earn commission on securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients.
The commission earned is recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction, as this is the date on which the service is provided to the client and the Group becomes entitled to the income.
Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The Group also earns initial commission from annuity services and from third party providers on the set up of group pension schemes.
Initial commissions on group pension schemes are deemed to be earned at the policy inception date on those policies where there are only negligible ongoing services.
Where ongoing services are provided, an appropriate proportion of the income is deferred over the relevant period.
Where such commission is received on an indemnity basis, a provision is made for clawbacks, if any, which would be due if the policy lapses during the indemnity period.
Other Other income principally represents the amount of fees receivable from the provision of Funds Library services, and is recognised on an accruals basis when the services are provided.
Investment revenue recognition Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal balance and the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Commission payable, staff costs and other operating costs Commission payable represents a percentage of renewal income paid to clients as a loyalty bonus.
Staff costs represent amounts paid to employees in respect of services provided in the year including wages and salaries, share-based payment expenses, bonuses, payments to a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme and related social security costs.
Other operating costs represent those arising as a result of our operations and include depreciation and amortisation.
All amounts are recognised on an accrual basis.
FSCS costs are those relating to the running of and the levies issued under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and are recognised in accordance with IFRIC 21.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Provisions are recognised for: - future committed property lease payments when the Group receives no benefit from the property through continuing usage and future receipts from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the Groups future committed payments.
- commissions received on indemnity terms where there may be a liability to repay the commissions received.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
78 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Prior to 15 May 2007 the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore, in the absence of a readily available market price for the shares, the share price was based on the market value agreed with HM Revenue & Customs and share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility applying to a comparable group of listed companies.
Any gains or losses on sale of the Companys own shares held by the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust EBT are credited or debited directly to the EBT reserve and are treated as undistributable profits.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged on all plant and equipment based on the estimates of their useful economic lives and expected residual values, which are reviewed annually.
Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.
The charge is calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment: Leasehold property tenants fixtures and other fixtures over 3 to 10 years Computer hardware over 3 to 10 years Office equipment over 3 to 10 years The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Leasing Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill Other intangible assets comprise computer software and the Groups key operating system which are stated at cost less amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Computer software over 3 to 8 years Computer software relates entirely to purchases and does not include any internally generated value.
The carrying values of computer software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Internally generated assets Assets under construction IT development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset, which delivers benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised and in accordance with the recognition criteria of IAS 38.
Development work has been undertaken in-house by IT staff and management to enhance the key operating systems.
Until 1 July 2012 this cost was not material and was recognised as an expense, the amounts are now more material and hence the costs are being capitalised as an intangible asset and subsequently amortised over the estimated useful life of Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 79 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements the system.
Where such costs relate to an asset that is not yet available for use by the business, they have been separately classified as assets under construction and have not been amortised, but instead been reviewed for impairment.
Internally generated assets Where IT development costs relate to an asset that is now used amortisation is over an estimated useful life of 8 years.
Internal policies exist to identify intangible assets that can be capitalised and in the case of internally generated assets a process of time sheets for IT developers and management time is used to identify the costs to be capitalised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Dividend recognition Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and paid, or, if earlier, in the accounting period when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Subsequently appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are made and recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as debtors.
Market receivables and payables are presented net where there is a legal right of offset.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the time-frame established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
The Groups available-for-sale investments have been included at fair value where a fair value can be reliably calculated, with the revaluation gains and losses reflected in the investment revaluation reserve, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 73, until sale when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
If a fair value cannot be reliably calculated by reference to a quoted market price or other method of valuation, available-for-sale investments are included at cost.
If required a fair value adjustment would be recognised upon disposal of the investment.
Investments which are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price of the listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement.
An investment is classified in this category if it is held principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
The carrying amount of these assets is approximately equal to their fair value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
All financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost apart from trade payables.
80 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value which is equivalent to amortised cost.
In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, Stock Exchange member firms and other counterparties are included as creditors.
Market debtors and creditors are presented net where there is a legal right of offset.
Interests in other entities The Group has determined that investment funds that it manages are structured entities.
Structured entities include entities that are designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the relevant activities are directed by means of a contractual relationship.
As the Group directs the investing activities of the eight Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-Manager funds through its investment management agreements with them, it considers them to be structured entities.
The Group holds interests in these funds through the receipt of management fees, together with ownership interests that it holds.
Investments in the funds have been designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
KEY SOURCES OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where a higher degree of judgement or complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are minimal and discussed below.
Share-based payments In determining the fair value of equity-settled share-based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions about the future events and market conditions.
In particular, judgement must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.
The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model which is dependent on future estimates, including the Groups future dividend policy, the timing with which the options will be exercised and the future volatility in the price of the Groups shares.
Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could affect the reported value of share-based payments.
Whilst this is an area of judgement in the financial statements, the value of share-based payments is not materially impacted by the selection of assumptions and consequently no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
The main assumptions are provided in Note 25.
REVENUE Revenue represents commission receivable from financial services provided to clients, interest income on client money and management fees charged to clients.
It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax.
An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 Revenue from services: Recurring income 329,900 287,293 Transactional income 58,816 65,118 Other income 6,421 5,982 Total revenue 395,137 358,393 Recurring income principally comprises renewal income, management fees, platform fees and interest income on client money.
Transactional income principally comprises commission earned from stockbroking transactions.
Other income principally represents the amount of fees receivable from the provision of funds data services and research through Library Information Services Ltd to external parties.
The policies adopted for the recognition of each significant revenue stream are set out in Note 2 above.
Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 81 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Following the implementation of the Retail Distribution Review RDR on 1 March 2014, total revenue earned from investment funds held by clients significantly increased as a new platform fee was introduced.
At the same time commission income is being received from the fund management groups on funds purchased by clients before the RDR implementation date.
Where we still receive commission on these pre-RDR or legacy funds the vast majority is now passed back to our clients in the form of a significantly higher loyalty bonus which is shown within commission payable in the income statement.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group is organised into three business segments, namely the Vantage division, the Discretionary Managed division and the Third Party Other Services division.
This is based upon the Groups internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is provided with financial information.
The CODM has been identified as the Board of Executive Directors.
The Vantage division represents all activities relating to our direct to private investor platform.
The Discretionary Managed division is focused on the provision of managed services such as our Portfolio Management Service PMS and range of Multi-Manager funds.
The Third Party Other Services division includes activities relating to the broking of third party investments and pensions, certificated share dealing and other niche services such as currency, CFDs and spread betting.
In this division, clients investments are not administered within the Group.
The Group segment contains items that are shared by the Group as a whole and cannot be reasonably allocated to other operating segments.
Segment expenses are those that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably be allocated to the segment.
Gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income, interest payable and tax are not allocated by segment.
Segment assets and liabilities include items that are directly attributable to a segment plus an allocation on a reasonable basis of shared items.
Corporate assets and liabilities are not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.
At 30 June 2015 and 2014, these comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, tax-related and other assets or liabilities.
Consolidation adjustments relate to the elimination of inter-segment revenues at arms length prices, balances and investments in group subsidiaries required on consolidation.
The breakdown of revenue from external customers for each type of service is therefore the same as the segmental analysis above.
Information about geographical area All business activities are located within the UK.
Information about major customers The Group does not rely on any individual customer.

The auditors,  LLP, have not received any remuneration for non-audit services of any kind.
STAFF COSTS The average monthly number of employees of the Group including executive directors was: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 No.
Operating and support functions 638 564 Administrative functions 272 230 910 794 Their aggregate remuneration comprised: 000 000 Wages and salaries 41,630 38,528 Social security costs 4,949 6,666 Share-based payment expenses 2,109 2,016 Other pension costs 4,429 4,070 53,117 51,280 84 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The staff costs above are after stripping out costs that have been capitalised under intangible assets as assets under construction.
The Group aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre employees by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, which may be linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for employees of comparable status, responsibility and skills.
All employees are eligible to be considered for an annual discretionary bonus.
In addition to cash bonuses, the Group operates various share-based remuneration schemes as described in Note 25.
Other pension costs relate wholly to defined contribution schemes.
INVESTMENT REVENUE Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 Interest on bank deposits 896 1,646 Dividends from equity investment 91 122 987 1,768 9.
TAX Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 Current tax: on profits for the year 41,749 46,723 Current tax: adjustments in respect of prior years - 35 Deferred tax Note 19 : 41 235 Deferred tax: adjustments in respect of prior years 1 59 41,789 47,052 Corporation tax is calculated at 20.75% of the estimated assessable profit for the year to 30 June 2015 2014: 22.5%.
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, certain tax amounts have been charged or credited directly to equity as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 Deferred tax relating to share-based payments 592 56 Current tax relating to share-based payments 1,305 3,848 713 3,904 Factors affecting tax charge for the year It is expected that the ongoing effective tax rate will remain at a rate approximating to the standard UK corporation tax rate in the medium term.
The standard UK corporation tax rate was reduced to 20% from 21% on 1 April 2015 and accordingly the Groups profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 20.75%.
Deferred tax has been recognised at 20%, being the rate substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset in respect of future share option deductions has been recognised based on the Companys share price as at 30 June 2015.
Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 85 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Factors affecting future tax charge Any increase or decrease to the Companys share price will impact the amount of tax deduction available in future years on the value of shares acquired by staff under share incentive schemes.
The Finance Act 2013 received Royal Assent on 17 July 2013 and has reduced the standard rate of UK corporation tax to 20% from 1 April 2015.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 Profit before tax from continuing operations 199,038 209,786 Tax at the standard UK corporate tax rate of 20.75% 2014: 22.50% 41,302 47,205 Items allowable not allowable for tax 424 396 Effect of adjustments relating to prior year 1 94 Impact of the change in tax rate 64 149 Tax expense for the year 41,789 47,052 Effective tax rate 21.0% 22.4% 10.
DIVIDENDS Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 2014 Second interim dividend of 15.39p 2013: 14.38p per share 72,449 67,355 2014 Special dividend of 9.61p 2013: 8.91p per share 45,248 41,734 2015 First interim dividend of 7.3p 2014: 7.0p per share 34,374 32,924 Total dividends paid during the year 152,071 142,013 After the balance sheet date, the directors declared a second interim final ordinary dividend of 14.30 pence per share and a special dividend of 11.40 pence per share payable on 30 September 2015 to shareholders on the register on 18 September 2015.
Dividends are required to be recognised in the financial statements when paid, and accordingly the declared dividend amounts are not recognised in these financial statements, but will be included in the 2016 financial statements as follows: 000 2015 Second interim dividend of 14.30p 2014: 15.39p per share 67,457 2015 Special dividend of 11.40p 2014: 9.61p per share 53,803 Under an arrangement dated 30 June 1997 the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee Benefit Trust, which held the following number of ordinary shares in Hargreaves Lansdown plc at the date shown, has agreed to waive all dividends.

EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in free issue during the year, including ordinary shares held in the EBT reserve which have vested unconditionally with employees.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

GOODWILL Year ended Year ended 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 000 000 Cost - at beginning and end of year 1,450 1,450 Accumulated impairment losses At beginning and end of year 117 117 Carrying amount - at end of year 1,333 1,333 The net carrying value of goodwill relates entirely to the acquisition of Hargreaves Lansdown Pensions Direct Limited HLPD now named Hargreaves Lansdown Advisory Services Limited HLAS.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has prepared financial forecasts for the business for the period to June 2018 which show that the Group as a whole will remain highly profitable and cash generative.
Within the forecast, the revenue streams which belong to HLAS, although lower than before the restructuring, are forecast to grow with the company continuing to be profitable.
HLAS is profit-making profit before tax for year ended 30 June 2015 was 3.4 million and has a net assets position as at 30 June 2015 of 7.8 million, therefore the directors see no reason to impair the value of goodwill and continue to hold it at its carrying amount.

Assets under construction are primarily internally generated being IT development staff working on an upgrade of the core IT platform for the business.
The internally generated intangible asset under construction is an ongoing project and whilst the system is still being developed to allow it to handle current transactions, tranches of archived information have been transferred across to the new system and therefore amortisation has started despite development work being ongoing.
Computer software includes no internally generated value.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Equity-settled share option scheme The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by employees, principally through schemes which encourage and assist the purchase of the Companys shares.
The Group operates four share option and share award plans: the Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE, the Hargreaves Lansdown plc Share Incentive Plan SIP, the Hargreaves Lansdown Company Share Option Scheme the Executive Option Scheme and the Hargreaves Lansdown Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP.
Awards granted under the Employee SAYE scheme vest over five years.
Awards granted under the Employee Share Incentive Plan vest over a threeyear period.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme vest between nil and a maximum of ten years.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
There are currently no performance conditions attached to any options granted under any of the schemes, although options are forfeited in most circumstances if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Interests in shares purchased under the JSOP were granted at under market value, with tax and National Insurance being paid on the difference.
The shares must be held for a minimum of three years under the terms of the Deeds and are realisable in only very limited circumstances before that date.
There are no performance conditions attached to the shares.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year ended 30 June 2015 and the year ended 30 June 2014 has been estimated by the Black-Scholes methodology and the principal assumptions required by the methodology were as follows: At 30 June 2015 At 30 June 2014 Weighted average share price 1,081.21p 1,198.42p Expected dividend yields 3.43% 2.73% SAYE Weighted average exercise price 958.00p 1,143.00p Expected volatility 34% 33% Risk-free rate 1.04% 1.87% Expected life 5 years 5 years Executive scheme Weighted average exercise price 971.78p 1,154.68p Expected volatility 31% 34% Risk-free rate 1.29% 1.28% Expected life 4.1 years 3.8 years The expected volatility The expected Hargreaves Lansdown Plc share price volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price since flotation in May 2007.
Prior to 15 May 2007 the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore no readily available market price existed for the shares.
The share price of share option awards granted prior to 15 May 2007 were based on the latest market value agreed with HM Revenue & Customs using an earnings multiples approach based on comparable quoted companies.
Similarly, share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility experienced by a comparable group of quoted companies.
Since 15 May 2007, a quoted market price has been available for the Companys shares.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in Note 7.
EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE On 9 September 2015 the directors proposed a second interim ordinary dividend payment of 14.30 pence per ordinary share and a special dividend of 11.40 pence per ordinary share, payable on 30 September 2015 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 September 2015 as detailed in Note 10.
As mentioned in the Chief Executives Review, two deals have been signed with third party companies who wish to transfer their books of business to Hargreaves Lansdown post year-end.
In total the deals could mean an additional 12,000 clients and 430 million of assets transfer across to the Vantage platform in the autumn of 2015 after the date of approval of the Report and Financial Statements.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, and with its directors and members of the Executive Committee the key management personnel.
Transactions between the Company and its key management personnel are disclosed below.
Details of transactions between the Company and other related parties are also disclosed below.
Trading transactions The Company entered into the following transactions with directors within the Hargreaves Lansdown Group and related parties who are not members of the Group: During the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 the Company has been party to a lease with P K Hargreaves, a director until 14 April 2015, for rental of the old head office premises at Kendal House.
A ten-year lease was signed on 6 April 2011 for a rental of part of the building, to be used for disaster recovery purposes at a market rate rent of 105,000 per annum.
No amount was outstanding at either year-end.
During the year the Company settled certain personal expenses on behalf of one director, all of which were subject to subsequent reimbursement from the director.
At the year end the amount outstanding was nil 2014: 4,999.
On 7 November 2014, the Group agreed to purchase 30 shares in its subsidiary, Library Information Services Ltd LIS, in an arms length transaction: increasing the Groups share-holding from 75% to 78%.
The shares were purchased from Stuart Louden the founder director of LIS and currently the only other shareholder, who is an employee of Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Limited.
The price paid per share was 35,405.
There is no readily available market for these shares and hence a valuation was arrived at based on a multiple of operating profit.
The directors of Hargreaves Lansdown plc deemed this to be a fair price in the circumstances.
The total amount paid was 1,062,150 and this was settled in cash on 17 December 2014.
During the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 the Group has provided a range of investment services in the normal course of business to shareholders on normal third party business terms.
Directors and staff are eligible for a slight discount on some of the services provided.

Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 99 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 28.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments a Financial risk management Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset listed and unlisted investments.
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables.
The main risks arising from financial instruments are market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below.
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis.
Hargreaves Lansdowns financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed company.
The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board.
b Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest-bearing assets.
There is an exposure to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2015 the value of financial instruments on the Group balance sheet exposed to interest rate risk was 216.75 million 2014: 201.24 million comprising cash and cash equivalents.
A 50bps 0.5% move in interest rates, in isolation, would impact investment income by c. 0.9 million per annum.
This impact, after taking into account the corresponding increase decrease in the Groups tax charge, would lead to a change in retained profit for the year.
This exposure is continually monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints.
The Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or refinancing risk on borrowings.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short-term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 13 months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective fixed term deposit rates.
As a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on cash balances held for clients.
These balances are not on the Group balance sheet but amounted to 5,392million 2014: 4,045 million.
Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
With substantially all of the Groups businesses located within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
Given the limited nature of transactions and assets involving foreign currencies no sensitivity analysis has been conducted as the impact would be minimal.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not meeting its expected value.
The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group balance sheet.
At 30 June 2015, the fair value of investments recognised on the Group balance sheet was 909,000 2014: 874,000.
A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to security price risk on investments held for clients.
These assets are not on the Group balance sheet.
The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset class diversification.
The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks, and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails to fulfil its obligations.
The impact of these risks is minimised by limits and monitoring controls.
c Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
The Group is highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets.
The Group actively maintains a proportion of cash balances on short-term deposit to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
100 Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The table below analyses the maturities of the undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities of the Group based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date at the balance sheet date.
0-3 months 3-6 months 6-12 months Over 1 year Total 000 000 000 000 000 At 30 June 2015 Trade and other payables: Trade payables 362,808 - - - 362,808 Other payables 11,793 - - 383 12,176 374,601 - - 383 374,984 At 30 June 2014 Trade and other payables: Trade payables 242,153 - - - 242,153 Other payables 16,385 - - - 16,385 258,538 - - - 258,538 d Credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as credit exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Within the Groups Stockbroking operation, the Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the period between the trade date and the settlement date.
This period is generally three business days.
The Group has credit exposure that extends beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities.
These transactions are with financial institutions and clients.
Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby, if a counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty.
In that instance, the securities could be sold in the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of delivery versus payment trade debtors.
As a result, the risk exposure is effectively to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and settlement.
Other credit risk within the Group is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the majority represents balances due from other regulated financial institutions where there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and institution.
Credit risk is therefore considered to be limited.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.

The Groups objectives when managing capital are i to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: ii to maintain a strong capital base and utilise it efficiently to support the development of its business: and iii to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Groups management and Board.
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive prescribed in the UK by the FCA.
The Directive requires continual assessment of the Groups risks in order to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 Minimum Capital Requirements and Pillar 2 Supervisory Review requirements is met.
Pillar 2 requires firms to assess firm-specific risks not covered by the formulaic requirements of Pillar 1 and, where necessary, maintain additional capital - the objective being to ensure that the regulated firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks.
The Group completes its assessment of regulatory capital requirements using its Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP under Pillar 2, which is a forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major risks, such as a significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action.
The ICAAP covers current as well as projected capital requirements, and is used to manage regulatory capital.
Surplus regulatory capital was maintained throughout the year at both a consolidated Group level, as well as at an individual regulated entity level.
Under the requirements of Pillar 3 Disclosure, the Group is required to disclose regulatory capital information, and has done so by making the disclosures available in the Groups website at http: www.
