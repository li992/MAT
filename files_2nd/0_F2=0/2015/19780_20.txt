The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 22 June 2015.
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of the relative size and volatility of the cash-settled share incentive scheme charges it has been decided to separately disclose the amounts on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
During the current period, as a result of the significant fall in the Companys share price, the share incentive scheme charge has become a credit due to the required revaluation of certain share incentives at year end.
Separate disclosure was therefore deemed appropriate in order to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of intangible assets has also been separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.
The Board has decided to restate the Groups historical accounts to reflect the impact of a write-down of an unbilled energy debtor previously carried on the Groups balance sheet.
Further detail regarding the restatement is set out in note 22.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future.
The judgements, estimations, and assumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In future, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 89 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Basis of preparation continued i Revenue recognition Revenue relating to the sale of energy includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns, prevailing weather data and other industry information.
Whilst the estimation routines are currently considered appropriate, a significant change in historical consumption patterns and or a failure to maintain the accuracy of the estimation routines could impact the amount of revenue recognised.
ii Intangible assets The Group intangible assets relate to the entering into of the energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013.
The valuation of intangible assets represents a significant area of judgment as certain key assumptions are required in relation to the future financial performance of the assets.
Further detail regarding intangible assets is set out in notes 6 and 21. iii Trade receivables Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter, or are in the process of having such a meter installed.
This requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on historical experience.
While the provisions are currently considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic and regulatory conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
iv Share incentive scheme charges The Group has a conventional share option scheme and a Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP for employees and Directors.
The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Binomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions.
The fair value of JSOP awards is also estimated using the Binomial valuation model, however, as a cash-settled award the valuation is conducted at each reporting period end.
The assumptions used in the valuations are described in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of comprehensive income.
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Company during the current accounting period, but where relevant to the Company they have not had a material impact on the financial statements: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements 2011 : IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 2011 : IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
90 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Control is recognised where an investor is expected to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the relevant activities of the investee.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
d Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for in accordance with the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3.
An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their own right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3.
Where an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 i. e. it does not have, inter alia, the inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis the acquisition of the subsidiary is treated as an acquisition of assets.
The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised.
Transaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition.
Where an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
e Revenue Overview Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
For each of the Groups main income streams from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods takes place.
The Groups customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services are provided.
The Group also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and accidental death cover to customers for a monthly fee.
The Group does not retain the insurance risk for these services.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 91 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED e Revenue continued Revenue recognition Energy services The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by the Group relies on estimates of usage where meter readings are not available.
These estimates are based on historical usage information adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather.
Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled revenue is accrued at each period end.
Revenue recognition Telephony services The Group principally generates revenue from providing the following telecommunications services: i fixed telephony line rental, call and broadband data charges: and ii mobile telephony call and data charges, and mobile handset sales.
Revenue for mobile handset sales are recognised when the devices are delivered to the end customer and the sale is considered complete.
Revenue recognition Other services The Group also generates revenues from providing Members with bill protection cover, and CashBack cards.
In addition the Group generates revenues from providing services to its network of independent distributors.
f Interest income Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
g Leases Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Hire purchase agreements Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases.
When assets are leased out under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
i Taxation The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
92 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided on other assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 50 years Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 to 25 years Plant and machinery 15 years Fixtures, fittings and office equipment - Fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years - Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
k Intangible assets Intangible assets which arise e. g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of their useful life and the term of any contractual arrangement or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.
l Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
m Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
n Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments.
In the Group accounts investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends received from the associated undertakings.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 93 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED o Inventories Inventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
p Financial instruments The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
q Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
r Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, revolving credit facilities.
s Borrowings Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans.
The fees associated with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over the term of the borrowings.
t Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
u Share based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
All share option based remuneration is equity settled, except as set out below.
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan the JSOP on 30 March 2011.
On vesting, any gains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee either through: i a cash payment to the participant equal to the gain: or ii the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the participant of such number of shares as have full value equal to the gain.
JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
94 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED v Segmental reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
w Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
x Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees personal pension plans.
These are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
y Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
z New standards issued but not yet effective The Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.
It is not expected that adoption of the standards or interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been adopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 95 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
SEGMENT REPORTING The Groups reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised: Customer Acquisition: and Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues represent joining fees from the Groups distributors, the sale of marketing materials and sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers.
Customer Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, electricity and internet services to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which is referred to as operating profit.
The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both operating segments.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2015 2014 000 000 Group Cost At 1 April 224,563 2,969 Additions - 221,594 At 31 March 224,563 224,563 Amortisation At 1 April 3,785 - Charge for the year 11,186 3,785 At 31 March 14,971 3,785 Carrying amount At 31 March 209,592 220,778 The Group intangible assets primarily relate to the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited the Companies from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013 the Transaction.
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of 196.5 million on 20 December 2013, a deferred amount of 21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a payment of 2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash and short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of 221.6 million in 2014 therefore represented the total consideration paid and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus certain transaction costs of 3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards were recognised as a cost of acquisition.
The intangible asset is being amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of the intangible assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2015 to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A post-tax discount rate of 8.5% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation that, for term of the contract and beyond, the Group will continue to derive significant value from supplying energy to its customers.
The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2015 indicated that no impairment was necessary.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of intangible assets.
Further information regarding the energy supply arrangements is set out in note 21 of these financial statements.

The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2015 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A post-tax discount rate of 10% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of goodwill.

In July 2014 the Group restructured the Transaction Facility which involved the early repayment of Term Loan B and extending the maturity and repayment dates of Term Loan A.
An extension to the Working Capital Facilities up to 35 million was also agreed, with an additional 5 million for December 2014 to February 2015.

CAPITAL AND RESERVES CONTINUED The Groups current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day operating requirements.
In addition, as a result of the entering the energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities, the Groups capital management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised and that the schedule for repayment of the debt can be comfortably achieved.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of energy to the Companys customers.
This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
Dividends 2015 2014 000 000 Prior year final paid 19p 2014: 18p per share 15,105 12,656 Interim paid 19p 2014: 16p per share 15,125 11,265 The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 21p per ordinary share totalling approximately 16.7 million, payable on 18 August 2015, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 July 2015.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies the dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2015.
This dividend will be subject to income tax at each recipients individual marginal income tax rate.

EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Restated 2015 2014 000 000 Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share 32,301 27,463 Share incentive scheme credits charges net of tax 1,316 4,038 Amortisation of intangible assets 11,186 3,785 Earnings excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of 42,171 35,286 intangibles for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share Number Number 000 000 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic 79,581 72,775 earnings per share Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share incentive awards 783 1,223 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted 80,364 73,998 earnings per share 1 Adjusted basic earnings per share 53.0p 48.5p Basic earnings per share 40.6p 37.7p 1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 52.5p 47.7p Diluted earnings per share 40.2p 37.1p 1 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the intangible asset recognised as a result of the new energy supply arrangements entered into with Npower in December 2013.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2, awards made under the Companys JSOP share incentive scheme are deemed to be cash-settled.
In line with IAS 33 for EPS purposes it is assumed the gains will be settled in shares and it has therefore been deemed appropriate to present the above analysis of earnings per share as adjusted for share incentive scheme charges.
In the current year the share incentive charge relating to the JSOP was a credit of approximately 2,573,000 2014: charge of approximately 3,395,000.
It has also been deemed appropriate to present the analysis of adjusted earnings per share excluding the amortisation of intangible assets arising from the energy supply agreement with Npower in order to present a clearer picture of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

COMMITMENTS Operating lease commitments The Group is committed to make payments in respect of operating leases for land and buildings as follows: Company and Group 2015 2014 000 000 Amounts payable: Less than one year 91 183 Between one and five years 248 251 339 434 The principal lease arrangements relate to office premises.
Capital commitments At 31 March 2015 the Company had capital commitments of approximately 2,481,000 2014: 7,675,000 relating mainly to items in respect of the refurbishment of Merit House, the Groups new head office building, the acquisition of a small office building previously occupied by the Group and the acquisition of the licence for the source code of the software underlying the Groups billing system.
Energy supply arrangements The Group entered into a 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower the SSA on 20 December 2013.
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach by the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to 194 million may become payable by the Company to Npower.
Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were set out in paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 2013.
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors view, very unlikely to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type of termination event is remote.
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from 194 million to 11 million over the remaining life of the supply agreement.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, the additional consideration if payable may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement.
Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Groups customer base.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors of the Company.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their seniority and length of service The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan.
The distributor scheme The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company.
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
On 30 March 2011 the Company established a new Joint Share Ownership Plan The Telecom Plus PLC Joint Share Ownership Plan 2011 or the JSOP.
Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were issued to an Employee Benefit Trust the JSOP Share Trust administered by Barclays Wealth Guernsey Limited, which holds the shares jointly with the only current participant, Mr Lindsay.
The JSOP Share Trust was provided with an interest free loan from the Company to subscribe for the 500,000 shares, and therefore the transaction was cash flow neutral for the Company.
As set out in note u of the Significant Accounting Policies, JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value liability is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the amortisation charge in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value liability of the JSOP award of 335p per share as at 31 March 2015: a strike price of 553p per share, a share price of 888p as at 31 March 2015, expected volatility of 39.0%, an expected remaining life of 1 day, a risk free rate of 0.34% and an expected dividend yield of 4.5%.
A reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows: 2015 2014 Number Weighted Number Weighted average average exercise price exercise price At 1 April 1,921,149 855p 2,243,787 514p Options granted 1,040,900 1,294p 765,950 1,507p Options exercised 231,895 407p 653,888 310p Options lapsed expired 461,050 1,405p 434,700 1,060p At 31 March 2,269,104 991p 1,921,149 855p The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the year was 1,329p 2014: 1,612.9p.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board.
They are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of 158,593,000 2014: 202,268,000 and for the Company of 46,008,000 2014: 66,172,000.
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 227,546,000 2014: 251,835,000 and for the Company 143,488,000 2014: 149,317,000. Credit risk All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit: accordingly credit risk in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue.
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers.
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone who submits a properly completed application form.
Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have used delinquent customers, there is likely to be a delay before the Company is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable.
The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line basis across all ledgers, in both years.
No general impairment allowance has been provided in either year.
The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns.
The Groups profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK base rate of - 1% from current levels despite the increase in the level of net borrowings resulting from the transaction with Npower in December 2013.
Commodity price risk The Group is not materially exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such fluctuations through to its customers.
118 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Groups treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.
Foreign currency risk The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
Receivables due after one year include 3,971,000 2014: 4,242,000 due mainly from distributors which earns interest at variable rates above Base Rate.
Borrowing facilities At 31 March 2015, the Group had total working capital facilities of 35,000,000 2014: 25,000,000.
These facilities are available to the Group until 20 December 2017.
As at 31 March 2015 the Company had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy distribution charges with a total value covered of 12,023,500 2014: 11,787,500.
At 31 March 2015, the Group had a transaction loan facility of 70,000,000 2014: 100,000,000 which was fully drawn down.
The facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a cross guarantee with the Companys subsidiaries Electricity Plus Supply Limited, Gas Plus Supply Limited and Telecommunications Management Limited.
Further details of the facilities are set out in note 12 of these financial statements.
Fair values There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments and their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments.

ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS The Company entered into new energy supply arrangements with Npower through the acquisition of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited the Companies from Npower Limited on 20 December 2013 the Transaction.
The Transaction had economic effect from 1 December 2013.
The accounting treatment for the Transaction was considered against the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3.
It was determined that the acquisition of the Companies did not represent business combinations under IFRS 3 as both Companies did not have the three key elements of a standalone business as set out in IFRS 3 i. e. inputs, processes and outputs.
The principal factors behind this determination were as follows: i the Companies were originally set up solely as legal vehicles to facilitate the supply of energy to Telecom Plus customers by Npower: ii all customer relationships were acquired, held and managed by Telecom Plus: iii the Companies did not have any influence over the terms on which energy was supplied to them: iv the Companies were not able to influence who their customers were and had no pricing discretion for the onward supply of energy: v the Companies did not have any infrastructure, management or employees with all functions being carried out by either Telecom Plus or Npower: and vi given the unique nature of the Companies and the associated energy supply agreement between Telecom Plus and Npower, it was not considered feasible that another market participant could effectively acquire and operate the Companies on a standalone basis.
As a result of these factors the acquisition of the Companies was accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than as business combinations.
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a cash payment to Npower of 196.5 million on 20 December 2013, a deferred cash amount of 21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a cash payment of 2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash and short term working capital balances.
Summary balance sheets for the Companies as at 30 November 2013, adjusted for the payment of pre-disposal permitted dividends to Npower Limited on 11 December 2013 Gas Plus Supply Limited: 1,378,000 and Electricity Plus Supply Limited: 1,876,000, are set out below: Gas Plus Supply Limited As at 30 November 2013 000 Current assets Accrued revenues 32,372 Cash 31,136 Total assets 63,508 Current liabilities Accruals and other creditors 62,352 Total liabilities 62,352 Net assets 1,156 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 121 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21.

PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENT A detailed review was recently conducted of the unbilled energy debtor previously carried on the Groups balance sheet and which had accumulated over the seven years between April 2007 and March 2014.
As a result of this review it was concluded that a total of approximately 11 million net of an anticipated tax credit, was not likely to be recoverable.
This primarily related to higher levels of industry-wide leakage within the gas distribution network than had previously been anticipated.
Background In common with other domestic energy suppliers, the majority of the Groups customer energy invoices are prepared using estimated meter readings, as actual meter readings are rarely available on the date that bills are produced.
This gives rise to timing differences between the estimated volumes of energy invoiced to customers, and the actual volume of energy invoiced to the Group by energy industry system operators, which contribute to the unbilled energy debtor carried forward on the Group balance sheet.
A detailed assessment was recently undertaken of the accuracy of the estimates created by the Groups billing system and the recoverability of the unbilled energy debtor.
This review of current and historic meter reading data that existed at each balance sheet date provided a strong endorsement of the accuracy of the Groups billing system in calculating customer usage, but showed that overall leakage within the gas industry which is ultimately not billable to customers had been running at a higher rate than previously expected.
It was therefore decided to write down the unbilled gas energy debtor to bring its value in line with the amount expected to be recoverable.

PRIOR YEAR RESTATEMENT CONTINUED Restatement The Board has decided to restate the Groups accounts to reflect the impact of this write-down on previous years in order to provide stakeholders with an accurate reflection of the historic underlying trend in the performance of the business.
Gas Fully writing down the unbilled gas debtor insofar as it relates to our share of this industry-wide leakage, which has built up over the seven years to March 2014 has a negative balance sheet impact as at March 2014 of 11.0 million net of the anticipated 1.8 million tax credit.
Electricity As a result of the more sophisticated way in which wholesale costs are reconciled to actual customer meter readings by electricity industry system operators, the net negative balance sheet impact as at March 2014 from the restatement relating to Electricity is limited to 0.3 million.
This impact relates solely to providing accurately for timing differences.
The tables below set out the impact of the restatement on each line item affected in the prior year comparative financial statements presented in this Annual Report.
