01 Strategic report 02 Corporate governance 03 Financial statements 04 Other information During the year, Unite raised 115 million through a share placing.
The Remuneration Committee evaluated the potential impact on the outcomes of the performance related annual bonus in respect of 2015 performance and concluded that each measure was neutral to the capital raise and that no adjustment was therefore required.
Noting that this is the third successive year in which each Executive Director has been awarded the maximum individual rating, the Committee took time to carefully consider the performance of Messrs. Allan, Lister, Simpson and Smith against both their individual objectives and with regard to their contributions to the success of the business as a whole over the last few years.
In summary, the Committee is satisfied that each of the Executive Directors has been a significant contributor to the achievement of key business and divisional functional objectives, whilst continuing to demonstrate both strong personal progression and exceptional teamwork, and that therefore the performance ratings are merited.
Having already reached their respective share ownership guidelines, each Executive Director will receive 100% of their bonus awards in cash.

As the market price on the date of vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2015 of 645.8p.
The actual value at vesting will be started in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Executives also became entitled to cash in lieu of the dividends payable on vested LTIP shares over the three-year performance period.
