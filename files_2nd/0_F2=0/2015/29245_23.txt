INTEREST RECEIVABLE AND SIMILAR INCOME Accounting policy Revenue represents income derived from loans and advances to customers, operating lease rentals together with fees and commissions receivable.
Interest income and expense are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIRM.
The EIRM is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument, for example prepayment options, but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Income from finance lease and instalment credit agreements is recognised over the period of the leases so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Fees and commissions which are not considered integral to the EIR are recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided or received.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Effective interest rate IAS 39 requires interest earned from loans and advances to be measured under the EIRM.
Management must therefore use judgement to estimate the expected life of each instrument and hence the expected cash flows relating to it.
Management reviews the expected lives on a segmental basis, whereby products of a similar nature are grouped into cohorts that represent homogenous behavioural attributes.
The key assumptions applied by management in the EIR methodology are behavioural life of the assets and the quantum of future early settlement fee income.
The expected life behaviours are subjected to changes in internal and external factors and may result in adjustments to the carrying value of loans which must be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Management has limited historical experience of customer behaviours due to the relative immaturity of the portfolios and therefore models expected behaviour based on market trends and experience.
The actual behaviour of the portfolios are compared to the modelled behaviour on a quarterly basis and the modelled behaviours are adjusted if the modelled behaviour materially deviates from actual behaviour, with adjustments recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
During 2015 management assessed that the level of early redemption fees exceeded the modelled levels due to higher redemptions driven by higher liquidity levels in the market.
The modelled behavioural lives were adjusted, resulting in an adjustment to the Statement of Profit and Loss increasing profit by 2.4m.
Management continues to perform sensitivity analyses on the EIR models applied.
An increase decrease in the behavioural life of a loan by 10% per calendar month would result in a net income statement increase decrease of 0.6m 2014: 0.1m.

EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS Accounting policy Where the Group engages in share based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain of its employees, these are accounted for as equity settled share based payments in accordance with IFRS 2.
The equity is in the Ordinary 0.01 Shares.
The grant date fair value of a share based payment transaction is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the equity at the date of the grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique.
The amount recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss is based on amortising the grant date fair value at a constant rate to the vesting date.
Taxation on the amount recognised as an expense is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Tax benefits of equity settled share-based payment transactions that exceed the tax effected cumulative remuneration expenses are considered to relate to an equity item and are recognised directly in equity.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The fair value of shares in the employee Share Scheme was determined using valuation models.
The inputs to these models require management judgement to estimate the probability and timings of events taking place in the future.
The significant inputs used in the models include the attrition rates, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life.
The share-based payment recognised can be materially affected by these assumptions and the key drivers of change in the value are timing, probability and attrition rates.
The combined charge to the Consolidated Income Statement was 4.1m 2014: 0.1m.
The composition of the charge was PSP 3.4m, LTIP 0.6m and SAYE 0.1m.
Performance Share Plan On 31 January 2011 the Performance Share Plan was introduced for Directors and senior employees.
All shares were issued at a price of 1 per share.
Holders were entitled to receive a return on the shares acquired in the event of a prescribed exit event of the A shareholders.
The Incentive Share Scheme was governed by the Companys Articles of Association and is deemed by Management to be an equity settled scheme and has been accounted for as such in the financial statements of both the Company and its subsidiary, Shawbrook Bank Limited.
Participants had to remain in employment or be deemed as a good leaver to continue to qualify for the scheme.
Details of shares issued are shown in the table below: 2015 2014 No.

The fair values of the shares at the date of grant were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
The assumptions used are as follows: 2015 2014 Expected volatility 20% 20% Risk free rate 0.4% 0.4% Dividend yield 0% 0% Expected life 12 years 12 years Although the Black-Scholes equation assumes predictable constant volatility, this is not observed in real markets.
In order to estimate the annualised volatility we have assessed the past standard deviation of the stock price of comparable quoted banks over various time frames.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP During 2015 a number of share awards were granted to a set of individuals excluding Directors.
The individuals are entitled to receive an award to acquire a specific number of ordinary shares in Shawbrook Group Plc, subject to performance conditions.
The scheme is deemed to be an equity settled scheme and has been accounted for as such in the financial statements of both the Company and its subsidiary, Shawbrook Bank Limited.
The share awards are subject to performance conditions, being the Group earning a defined underlying profit before tax in 2017, and subject to the Group maintaining its threshold capital and liquidity requirements.

EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS continued The fair value of the shares is based on the share price at the dates of the grant discounted for any expected dividends over the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued adjusted for dividends was 3.25.
Save-As-You-Earn Scheme SAYE In October 2015 the Save-As-You-Earn SAYE scheme was introduced for all employees.
The Scheme provides employees with the opportunity to take part in a tax efficient savings scheme and to acquire Shawbrook Group plc shares at a discount to market value.
The shares subject to this option have no restrictions, save those restrictions applying as a matter of law, regulation and the Companys dealing code.
The SAYE scheme is governed by the Companys Articles of Association and is deemed by Management to be an equity settled scheme and has been accounted for as such in the financial statements of both the Company and its subsidiary, Shawbrook Bank Limited.

TAXATION Accounting policy Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2015 has been calculated based on an aggregation of the rate of 18% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and the additional 8% of tax suffered in relation to the banking surcharge.
LOANS AND ADVANCES TO CUSTOMERS Accounting policy Assets acquired in exchange for loans Included within loans and advances to customers are assets acquired in exchange for loans, instalment credit and finance lease receivables as part of an orderly realisation.
The asset acquired is recorded at the lower of its fair value less costs to sell and the carrying amount of the lease net of impairment allowance at the date of exchange.
Any subsequent write-down of the acquired asset to fair value less costs to sell is recognised in the Income Statement.
Any subsequent increase in the fair value less costs to sell, to the extent this does not exceed the cumulative write down, is also recognised in the Income Statement, together with any realised gains or losses on disposal.
Loans and advances to customers include those classified as loans and advances, finance leases and instalment credit advances as summarised below: 2015 2014 m m Loan receivables 2,873.0 1,861.4 Finance lease receivables 114.3 114.0 Instalment credit receivables 331.8 309.4 Total loans and advances to customers 3,319.1 2,284.8 At 31 December 2015, loans and advances to customers of 612.3m 2014: 535.2m were pre-positioned with the Bank of England and HM Treasury for use as collateral within the Funding for Lending Scheme.

IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS ON LOANS AND ADVANCES TO CUSTOMERS Accounting policy On an ongoing basis the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or Group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a Group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or Group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of impairment loss include, but are not limited to, the following: Delinquency in contractual payments of principal or interest: Cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower: and Initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on an individual financial asset has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a Group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Objective evidence of impairment of a portfolio of receivables exists if objective data indicates a decrease in expected future cash flows from a collection of receivables and the decrease can be measured reliably but cannot be identified with the individual receivables in the portfolio in which case a collective provision is applied.
The Group operates a forbearance policy in situations where it becomes aware that an individual customer is experiencing financial hardship.
Repayment options are discussed with the customer that is appropriate to the customers specific situation.
The Group seeks to ensure that any forbearance results in a fair customer outcome and will not repossess an asset unless all other reasonable attempts to resolve the position have failed.
Further information is provided on page 118.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Individual impairment losses on loans and advances are calculated based on an assessment of the expected cash flows and the underlying collateral.
For the purpose of collective impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics.
Collective provisions are calculated using roll rates on different segments of the loan book not subject to an individual provision.
Management also consider the need for a management overlay to take into account additional risk factors of the portfolio.
The management overlay has led to an increase of 1.9m 2014: 1.8m to the impairment allowances to reflect managements assessment of risk.
The key assumptions, being the emergence periods, cost of risk and roll rates, are monitored regularly to ensure the impairment allowance is entirely reflective of the current portfolio.
The accuracy of the impairment calculation would therefore be affected by unanticipated changes to the economic situation and assumptions which differ from actual outcomes.
For loans and advances to the extent that: There is a change of one month in the emergence period across all portfolios, this would have the effect of changing the collective provision by 0.5m 2014: 0.5m : There is a change in the loss rate by 10 basis points, this would have the effect of changing the collective provision by 1.5m 2014: 1.1m : There is an increase in the forced sale discount by 5%, this would have the effect of increasing the individual provisions by 0.4m 2014: 0.4m : and There is an increase in the propensity to default by 10%, this would have the effect of increasing the individual provisions by 1.0m 2014: 0.8m.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting policy Derivatives and hedge accounting The Groups derivative activities are entered into for the purposes of matching or eliminating risk from potential movements in interest rates in the Groups assets and liabilities.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risks.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are reviewed regularly for their effectiveness.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets and, where these are not available, from valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models.
Derivatives are measured as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative.
The Group has adopted hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 which specifies that the hedge relationship must be clearly documented at inception and the derivative must be expected to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk.
Effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
The Group does not apply a credit valuation adjustment CVA or debit valuation adjustment DVA of its derivative exposures as the Groups portfolio is fully collateralised.
The Group does not apply funding fair value adjustment FFVA or its derivative exposures as it deems the adjusment to be immaterial.
Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets and, where these are not available, from valuation techniques including discounted cash flows at a benchmark interest rate, typically Libor or its equivalent.
Fair Value Hedge The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
The Group uses derivatives to reduce exposure to market risks, and not for trading purposes.
The Group uses the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA Master Agreement to document these transactions in conjunction with a Credit Support Annex CSA.
The fair value of derivatives is set out below: Notional Amount Fair Value of assets Interest rate swaps m m Interest rate swaps: At 31 December 2015 535.0 2.8 Interest rate swaps: At 31 December 2014 195.0 3.7 2015 2014 Gains and losses from derivatives and hedge accounting are as follows: m m Loss Gain on derivative financial instrument 0.9 3.7 Fair value gain loss on hedged risk 0.6 3.8 Fair value loss on financial instruments 0.3 0.1 It is the Groups policy to enter into master netting and margining agreements with all derivative counterparties.
In general, under master netting agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty that are due on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount being payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount being payable by one party to the other and the agreements terminated.
Under the margining agreements where the Group has a net asset position valued at current market values, in respect of its derivatives with a counterparty, then that counterparty will place collateral, usually cash, with the Group in order to cover the position.
Similarly, the Group will place collateral, usually cash, with the counterparty where it has a net liability position.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Accounting policies Operating leases Included within property, plant and equipment are assets leased to customers under operating leases in respect of medical equipment.
The net book value of operating leases represents the original cost of the equipment less cumulative depreciation.
Rentals are recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation is recognised on a straight line basis to a residual value over the life of the associated agreement.
Depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of plant and equipment as follows: Office equipment three years five years Fixtures and fittings five years Motor vehicles four years Freehold property 50 years Leasehold costs life of the lease Operating leases life of the lease Operating leases are assets leased to customers Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Assets acquired in exchange for loans Included within property, plant and equipment are assets acquired in exchange for operating leases as part of an orderly realisation.
No depreciation is charged in respect of assets held for sale.
Residual values The residual values of assets under operating leases are reviewed by management for impairment, taking into account the nature and state of condition of the assets.
Where the residual value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are impaired and the impairment charged to the profit and loss account.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of companies whose businesses have been integrated within the Group and reflects the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired.
Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment by reviewing detailed cash flow projections from the Groups latest approved forecast.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
The estimation of recoverable value is based on value in use calculations incorporating forecasts by management of pretax profits for the subsequent five years, and a residual value, discounted at a risk-adjusted interest rate appropriate to the cash generating unit.
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its recoverable amount.
No impairment losses were recognised during 2015 2014: nil.
Computer software Expenditure on software development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends, has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of direct labour and software licence costs.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
Capitalised developments are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis through administrative expenses over the estimated useful life of the asset according to the following timescales: Computer software & licences 37 years Critical accounting estimates and judgements The review of goodwill for impairment reflects managements best estimate of future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both which are subject to uncertain factors as follows: The future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to projected cash flows based on the forecasts and assumptions regarding the projected periods and the long-term pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter.
The rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their valuations and are based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which incorporates inputs reflecting a number of variables.
These variables are subject to fluctuations beyond managements control, are subject to uncertainty and require the exercise of significant judgement.
The factors and inputs are described in more detail in the note below.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs as follows: 2015 2014 m m Secured Lending 6.4 6.4 Asset Finance 10.5 10.5 Consumer Lending 1.1 1.1 Business Credit 24.2 24.2 Commercial Mortgages 2.6 2.6 At 31 December 44.8 44.8 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been calculated based on their value in use VIU, determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated from the continuing use of the CGU.
No impairment losses were recognised in 2015 2014: nil because the recoverable amounts of the CGUs were determined to be higher than their carrying values.
The key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use were as follows: 31 December 2015 Pre-tax Discount rate % 13.80 Terminal value growth rate % 2.50 Cash flow period Years 5 Discount rate: The discount rate is an estimate of the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive from the asset, which is derived using CAPM.
The CAPM depends on inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These variables are based on the markets assessment of the economic variables and managements judgement.
For the 31 December 2015 test, the methodology used to determine the discount rate for the business was refined to more accurately reflect the risk profile of the Group.
In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rate derived using the internally generated CAPM with costs of capital rates produced by external sources.
Terminal value growth rate: The terminal value growth rate is an estimate of the rate of growth of future cash flows beyond the cash flow period of 5 years.
The rate is estimated by management, taking into account rates disclosed by comparable institutions.
Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU: Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model, which is based on a Board approved plan.
A long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the long term compound annual profit before tax growth rate estimated by Management.
The Dividend Discount Model DDM is used to calculate the recoverable amount of future cash flows.
The DDM discounts future cash flows post-tax profits generated by the CGU, however the cash flows are reduced by any earnings retained to support the growth in the underlying CGU loan books through higher regulatory capital requirements.
Forecasted post-tax profits were based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated revenue growth.
The key assumptions described above may change as economic and market conditions change.
The Group estimated that reasonably possible changes in these assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of any CGU to decline below the carrying amount.
DEFERRED TA X Accounting policy Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

The FSCS levy consists of two parts: a management expenses levy and a compensation levy.
The management expenses levy covers the costs of running the scheme and the compensation levy covers the amount of compensation the scheme pays, net of any recoveries it makes using the rights that have been assigned to it.
The FSCS meets these current claims by way of loans received from HM Treasury.
The terms of these loans were interest only for the first three years, and the FSCS seeks to recover the interest cost, together with ongoing management expenses, by way of annual management levies on members, including the Group, over this period.
The Groups FSCS provision reflects market participation up to the reporting date.
The above provision includes the estimated management expense levy for the scheme year 2015 16.
This amount was calculated on the basis of the Groups current share of protected deposits taking into account the regulators estimate of total management expense levies for the scheme year.
In addition to the management levies, the FSCS commenced charging for compensation levies over a number of scheme years commencing 1 April 2012 and an instalment of this was paid during the year.
No provision in respect of the capital compensation levy is included in the provision at 31 December 2015.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting policies Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: At fair value through profit or loss: and Loan receivables.
The Groups financial liabilities are designated as other financial liabilities at amortised cost and at fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is measured initially at fair value plus the transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition.
A financial liability is measured initially at fair value less the transaction costs that are directly attributable to its issue.
Derivative financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group has not classified any assets or liabilities as held to maturity or as available for sale AFS.
Loan receivables Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Loans and advances to banks and building societies are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and advances to customers include finance leases and instalment credit advances.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
The net investment in finance leases and instalment credit agreements represents the future lease rentals and instalments receivable less profit and costs allocated to future periods.
Income is recognised throughout the life of the agreement to provide a constant rate of return on the net investment in each lease or instalment credit agreement.
Where an agreement is classified as an operating lease at inception, but is subsequently reclassified as a finance lease following a change to the agreement or an extension beyond the primary term, then the agreement is accounted for as a finance lease.
Financial liabilities Customer deposits and amounts due to banks are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments.
Deposits and amounts due to banks are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Accounting policies fide-recognition of financial assets and liabilities fide-recognition is the point at which an asset or liability is removed from the balance sheet.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or where all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled, or expired.
If the terms of the financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised.
If the net present value of the cash flows from the original financial asset are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired.
In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and the new financial asset is recognised at fair value.
The impairment loss before an unexpected restructuring is measured as follows: If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the estimated cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in the measurement of the existing asset based on their expected timing and amounts discounted at the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.
If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition.
This amount is discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The Group determines fair value using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making measurements: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations.
The Group uses widely recognised valuation models for determining the fair value of common and more simple financial instruments, like interest rate and currency swaps that use only observable market data and require little Management judgement and estimation.
Observable prices and model inputs are usually available in the market for simple over the counter derivatives like interest rate swaps.
Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for Management judgement and estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with the determination of fair values.
Availability of observable market prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
The consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads assist in the judgement as to whether a market is active.
If, in the opinion of Management, a significant proportion of the instruments carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs, the instrument in its entirety is classified as valued at Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the level at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value consensus pricing data may, for example, be used.
Cash and balances with central banks Fair value approximates to carrying value because cash and balances at central banks have minimal credit losses and are either short-term in nature or reprice frequently.
Loans and advances to banks Fair value was estimated by using discounted cash flows applying either market rates where practicable or rates offered by other financial institutions for loans with similar characteristics.
The fair value of floating rate placements, fixed rate placements with less than six months to maturity and overnight deposits is considered to approximate to their carrying amount.
Loans and advances to customers, customer deposits, derivatives, amounts due to banks and subordinated debt Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date, adjusted for future credit losses if considered material.
Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets and, where these are not available, from valuation techniques including discounted cash flows.

RISK MANAGEMENT The main areas of risk that the business is exposed to are: Credit risk: Liquidity risk: Market risk: Capital risk and management: Operational risk: and Conduct Risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss should borrowers or counterparties default on their contractual obligations to the Group.
These risks are managed by the Board Risk Committee and Asset and Liability Committee.
This risk has two main components: Customer risk individual and business lending : and Treasury risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of its financial assets, without taking account of any underlying collateral, and contractual contractual commitments, which represent agreements entered into but not advanced as at 31 December 2015.

R ISK M ANAG EM EN T continued Credit quality of assets Loans and receivables The Group defines three classifications of credit quality low risk, medium risk and higher risk for all credit exposures.
These are based on the following criteria: Commercial mortgages: A risk rating scale is applied to the individual loans and weighs the propensity of non-performance and write-offs.
The combined propensity scores are scaled into a scale of low risk, medium risk and higher risk.
Asset finance: Loans are classified with reference to the arrears position and provisions against the loans.
Low risk items are items that are in arrears but have sufficient collateral against the outstanding balance, medium risk loans are in arrears, have sufficient collateral but are classified as medium risk due to forbearance measures applied, and higher risk loans are loans that are provided for.
Business Credit: Loans are classified as low risk, medium risk and higher risk on a case-by-case basis and decisions are based on managements review of the individual circumstances of every case.
Secured Lending: All cases are deemed low risk due to the collateral held against the outstanding loan balances.
Consumer Lending: The classification of loans as low risk, medium risk and higher risk is based on the maturity of the loans outstanding.
The credit quality of asset that are neither past due nor impaired are as follows: Commercial Mortgages Asset Finance Business Credit Secured Lending Consumer Lending Total As at 31 December 2015 m % m % m % m % m % m % Low Risk 1,577.7 99.5 684.6 99.3 168.6 91.6 470.9 100.0 331.8 99.9 3,233.6 99.2 Medium Risk 0.9 0.1 1.0 0.1 10.0 5.4 11.9 0.4 Higher Risk 5.7 0.4 3.9 0.6 5.6 3.0 0.1 15.2 0.4 Total neither past due nor impaired 1,584.3 100.0 689.5 100.0 184.2 100.0 470.9 100.0 331.8 100.0 3,260.7 100.0 Customer risk The Group maintains a forbearance policy for the servicing and management of customers who are in financial difficulty and require some form of concession to be granted, even if this concession entails a loss for the Group.
A concession may be either of the following: A modification of the previous terms and conditions of an agreement, which the borrower is considered unable to comply with due to its financial difficulties, to allow for sufficient debt service ability, that would not have been granted had the borrower not been in financial difficulties: or A total or partial refinancing of an agreement that would not have been granted had the borrower not been in financial difficulties.
Forbearance in relation to an exposure can be temporary or permanent in nature depending on the circumstances, progress on financial rehabilitation and the detail of the concession s agreed.
A forbearance classification can be discontinued when all of the following conditions have been met: The exposure is considered as performing, including, if it has been reclassified from the non-performing category, after an analysis of the financial condition of the borrower shows it no longer meets the conditions to be considered as non-performing: A minimum two year probation period has passed from the date the forborne exposure was considered as performing: Regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period: and None of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past-due at the end of the probation period.

Loans and advances to customers are reviewed regularly to determine whether there is any objective evidence of impairment and assets are categorised as detailed in the tables below: Type of impairment assessment Description Individual impairment Where specific circumstances indicate that a loss is likely to be incurred.
Collective impairment Impairment allowances are calculated for each portfolio on a collective basis, given the homogenous nature of the assets in the portfolio.
Risk categorisation Description Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are not in arrears and which do not meet the impaired asset definition.
This segment can include assets subject to forbearance solutions.
Past due but not impaired Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment, but the asset does not meet the definition of an impaired asset as the expected recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.
Impaired assets Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment and where the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the expected recoverable amount.
The Group enters into agreements with customers and where appropriate takes security.

R ISK M ANAG EM EN T continued Liquidity risk Accounting policy Funding for Lending Scheme FLS The Group is a participant in the FLS which enables it to borrow highly liquid UK Treasury Bills in exchange for eligible collateral.
The Treasury Bills issued are for an original maturity of nine months and if delivered back prior to their maturity date can be exchanged for further nine month Bills.
Costs of borrowing are charged directly to the Income Statement.
The Treasury Bills are not recorded on the Groups balance sheet as ownership remains with the Bank of England.
The risk and rewards of the collateral provided remains with the Group and continues to be recognised in the Groups Financial Statements.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its current and future financial obligations as they fall due, or is only able to do so at excessive cost.

Asset encumbrance The Groups assets can be used to support collateral requirements for central bank operations or third party repurchase transactions.
Assets that have been set aside for such purposes are classified as encumbered assets and cannot be used for other purposes.
All other assets are defined as unencumbered assets.
These comprise assets that are readily available to secure funding or meet collateral requirements, and assets that are not subject to any restrictions but are not readily available for use.

A comprehensive stress testing exercise is conducted at least annually and the methodology is incorporated into the Groups balance sheet risk management model to ensure that stress tests are run on a regular basis.
The output of stress testing is circulated to the Board and to the ALCO who will use the results to decide whether to amend the Groups risk appetite and liquidity limits.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the value of, or income arising from, the Groups assets and liabilities change as a result of changes in market prices, the principal element being interest rate risk.
The Group has minimal foreign currency exposure and does not engage in any treasury trading operations.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for managing the Groups exposure to all aspects of market risk within the operational limits set out in the Groups treasury policies.
The ALCO approves the Groups treasury policies and receives regular reports on all aspects of market risk exposure, including interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk arises from the loan and savings products that we offer.
This risk is managed through the use of appropriate financial instruments, including derivatives, with established risk limits, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures.
Basis risk Basis risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in the relationship between interest rates which have similar but not identical characteristics for example, LIBOR and Bank of England Base Rate.
This is monitored closely and regularly reported to the ALCO.
This risk is managed by matching and where appropriate and necessary, through the use of derivatives, with established risk limits and other control procedures.
The Groups forecasts and plans take account of the risk of interest rate changes and are prepared and stressed accordingly, in line with PRA guidance.

Interest rate sensitivity gap The Group considers a parallel 200 basis points bps movement to be appropriate for scenario testing given the current economic outlook and industry expectations.
The Group estimates that a - 200 bps movement in interest rates paid received would have impacted the economic value of equity as follows: 200 bps 8.0m positive 2014: 16.5m positive 200 bps 24.5m positive 2014: 14.3m positive In addition, the effect of the same two interest rate shocks are applied to the balance sheet at year-end, to determine how the Net Interest Income may change on an annualised basis for one year, as follows: 200 bps - 19.9m positive 2014: 19.3m positive -200 bps - 1.4m positive 2014: 1.8m positive In preparing the sensitivity analyses above, the Group makes certain assumptions consistent with expected and contractual re-pricing behaviour as well as behavioural repayment profiles, under the two interest scenarios, of the underlying balance sheet items.

Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the initial fair value, less cumulative amortisation, and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations.
Contingent Liabilities Contingent liabilities, which includes contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings or regulatory matters, are possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of Shawbrook Group: or are present obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote.
