These plans are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
The Groups two principal defined benefit plans are in the UK and in the US under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
The UK and US plans are final salary pension plans providing a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The US Plan also includes acash balance pension for US participants.
Both these plans are closed to further accrual of future pensionable service with pensions calculated based on salaries up until the date of closing the plan.
For UK participants, pensions in payment can be updated in line with the UK inflation indices, subject to caps and collars, whereas with US participants, pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
Benefit payments for both plans are from trustee or equivalent administered funds.
Plan assets are held in trust funds and are governed by local regulations intheir relevant jurisdictions by a trustee board advisory committee, whichis independent of the Group.
In conjunction with the Group, thetrustees or equivalent are responsible for the operation and governance of the fund, including making decisions relating to funding and investment strategy.
The Group is a partner in the Premier Farnell Pension Funding Scottish Limited Partnership SLP, under which the Group has contributed an interest in the SLP worth 18.0 million to the UK Plan, and transferred a number of properties under sale and leaseback arrangements to the SLP.
The SLP made distributions to the UK Plan of1.5 million during the year, and will make annual contributions of 1.5 million per year until 31 January 2026, or until the UK Plan is fully funded, if earlier.
The UK Plans interest in the SLP reduces the deficit on a funding basis, although it does not impact the deficit on an IAS 19 accounting basis, as the investment held by the UK Plan in the SLP does not qualify as an asset for the purposes of the fair value of scheme assets included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.
In respect of the defined contribution plans, the Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Re-presentation The Group operates a deferred compensation plan in the US for certain employees.
Contributions paid by Premier Farnell Corporation a US subsidiary into this plan are held in trust on behalf of employees until post employment.
Although the investment risk on the trusts assets is borne by the employee, the assets are ultimately available to the creditors of Premier Farnell Corporation and so do not meet the definition of plan assets for IAS 19 purposes.
The financial information for the year ended 2 February 2014 is derived from the statutory financial statements for that year, except certain comparative information has been re-presented to conform with the current year presentation.
The Group has re-presented 0.8 million of pension assets as investments held at fair value note 10, and also re-presented 0.4 million of accruals for Company contributions to trade and other payables within current liabilities note 17, with a corresponding net 0.4 million adjustment to post retirement obligations.
There is no overall effect on the Groups income statement, net assets or overall cash flows from these re-presentations.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 133 The net pension charge and balance sheet liability of the Groups pension plans are as follows: 2014 15 2013 14 m m Defined benefit plans UK 1.2 1.2 US 0.9 0.9 Other plans 0.4 0.4 Defined contribution plans 5.0 4.8 Total net pension charge in the year 7.5 7.3 2015 2014 m m Defined benefit balance sheet liability: UK Plan 23.9 18.1 US Plan 26.5 11.6 Other plans 0.9 0.9 51.3 30.6 The disclosures relating to the UK and US defined benefit plans are set out below based on valuations performed by Towers Watson, as at 1 February 2015, using the projected unit credit method.

For 2014, the rates of longevity for the UK Plan were based on the S1 tables projected from 2002 using the 2011 Core Projection Model with a long term rate of 1.25%.
The mortality tables have been based on a postcode mortality study, carried out as part of the 5 April 2014 funding valuation.
For the US Plan, the rates of longevity are based on standard tables RP-2014 and MP-2014 projection scale for 2015.
For 2014, the rates of longevity are based on RP-2000 with generational projections using scale BB.

The UK Plans investment strategy is to invest broadly 50% in return-seeking assets via diversified growth funds and 50% in matching assets index-linked gilts and corporate bonds.
This strategy reflects the UK Plans liability profile and the Trustees and Groups attitude to risk.
As the Fund matures, the Trustees and the Group expect to gradually reduce the proportion allocated to return-seeking assets and increase the proportion allocated to matching assets.
The majority of the US Plan assets follow a Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy.
At 1 February 2015, 95% of the US Plans assets were invested under this strategy, which comprised a mixture of corporate bonds, government bonds, swaps and futures.
The US Plan assets at 1 February 2015 included ordinary shares issued by Premier Farnell plc with a fair value of 3.9 million 2014: 5.1 million.
Premier Farnell Preference shares are not included in either UK or US investments.

The contributions expected to be paid during the financial year ending 31 January 2016 amount to 4.8 million including 0.5 million for expenses in respect of the UK Plan and nil in respect of the US Plan.
With regard to the US costs these are paid by the US Plan.
The weighted average duration of the defined obligation for the UK is 17 years and for the US Plan, 15 years.
Assets and obligations associated with the schemes may be sensitive to changes in market values of assets and market related assumptions used in the valuation of scheme liabilities.
Changes to asset values, discount rates or inflation could change future pension costs and funding requirements.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the plan assets and liabilities at the year-end, with all other variables held constant, is givenbelow: UK Plan US Plan Increase in Increase in Net balance Increase in Increase in Net balance plan obligations plan assets sheet impact plan obligations plan assets sheet impact Sensitivity analysis m m m m m m 1 Discount rate 1% decrease 22.5 2.0 20.5 23.2 12.3 10.9 Inflation and inflation 0.5% increase 3.1 2.5 0.6 2.9 1.7 1.2 2 related assumptions Increase of 1 year in Mortality expected lifetime of plan 3.7 3.7 3.4 3.4 participants 1 The change in discount rate is assumed to be due to a 1% per annum decrease in corporate bond yields.
2 The sensitivities to inflation assumption changes include corresponding changes to the future salary and pension increase assumptions.
136 Premier Farnell Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued In practice the assumption that all other variables are held constant isunlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The same method for calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes inthe principal assumptions has been applied as that used when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of direct risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
Asset volatility plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If plan assets underperform this yield, this will create or increase a deficit.
Changes in bond yields decreases in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation risk some of the Groups pension obligations UKs are linked to inflation.
Rises in inflation will lead to higher liabilities with caps and floors on the level of inflationary increases to protect against extreme inflation.
The index-linked bonds within plan assets will be directly affected by inflation, with the remainder being unaffected directly.
Life expectancy plan obligations are to provide benefits for the lifetime of the member.
Increases in life expectancy will lead to increased plan liabilities.
B Post-retirement medical benefits In the US, the Group sponsors a retiree medical plan that provides certain healthcare benefits to Union participants in the US.
The plan was closed to new participants in May 2003 and based on service earned as of that date employees are eligible for either healthcare coverage until death or until eligible under Medicare.
The plan is unfunded and is contributory, with participants paying for a portion of their coverage.
Any changes to the plan are negotiated with the Union.
The costs of this plan are paid by the Group up to a maximum of $400,000 per claim.
Above this threshold the Group is insured.
The method of accounting for these is similar tothat used to account for defined benefit pension obligations.
The charge for the year was 0.7 million 2013 14: 0.7 million and the balance sheet obligation at 1 February 2015 amounted to 19.4 million 2014: 14.5million.
The disclosures relating to post-retirement medical benefits are based on an actuarial valuation performed by Towers Watson, as at 1 February 2015.
The principal assumptions were as follows: 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.2% 4.4% Medical inflation 5.0% 5.0% Life expectancy of a 60-year-old male currentretiree 26 yrs 25 yrs Life expectancy of a 60-year-old male futureretiree 27 yrs 26 yrs T he assumed long term rate of medical inflation is 5.0% per annum.
In 2015, the initial rate has been assumed to be 7.0%, which is assumed for one year and then to reduce to the long term rate at 0.25% per annum over eight years.
In 2014, the initial rate was assumed to be 7.5% for one year and then to reduce to the long term rate at 0.5% per annum over five years.
For 2015, future life expectancy is based on RP-2014 and MP-2014 projection scale.
The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2014 15 2013 14 m m Service cost 0.1 0.1 Interest cost 0.6 0.6 Total charge included in total net operatingexpenses 0.7 0.7 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 137 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are asfollows: 2014 15 2013 14 m m Beginning of year 14.5 14.5 Total charge 0.7 0.7 Payments 1.0 1.1 Actuarial losses 3.8 1.0 Currency translation adjustment 1.4 0.6 End of year 19.4 14.5 The contributions expected to be paid during the financial year ending 31 January 2016 amount to 1.0 million including 0.1 million for expenses.
