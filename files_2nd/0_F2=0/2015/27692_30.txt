Strategic report Governance Financial statements OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 93 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2015 1.
Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accounts for the Group and the Bank are set out below.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union EU : and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets, derivative contracts and financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no statement of profit or loss is presented for the Bank.
b Going concern The Board undertakes regular rigorous assessments of whether the Bank is a going concern in the light of current economic conditions and all available information about future risks and uncertainties.
Projections for OneSavings Bank plc have been prepared, covering its future performance, capital and liquidity, for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements including stress scenarios.
These projections show that the Group has sufficient capital and liquidity to continue to meet its regulatory requirements as set out by the Prudential Regulatory Authority.
The Board has therefore concluded that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for a period in excess of 12 months and as a result it is appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis.
c Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the results of the Bank and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Upon consolidation inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
In the Banks financial statements investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
d Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the presentation currency of the Group.
The financial statements of each of the Banks subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates the functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate prevailing at the period end.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the re-translation and settlement of these items are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items are not re-translated.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with functional currencies other than sterling are translated into the presentation currency at the exchange rate on the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the rates on the dates of transactions.
Exchange differences on foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve within equity.
When a foreign operation is wholly or partly disposed of with loss of control, the relevant accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
In a partial disposal without loss of control, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reattributed to noncontrolling interest.
e Segmental reporting IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports and components of the Group which are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
For this purpose, the chief operating decision maker of the Group is the Board of Directors.
The Group lends solely within the UK and the Channel Islands and as such no geographical analysis is required.
The Group segments its lending by product, focusing on the customer need and reason for a loan.
It operates under three segments: Buy-to-Let SME, Residential Mortgages, and Personal Loans.
f Interest income and expense Interest income and interest expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments measured at amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate EIR method.
The EIR is the rate which exactly discounts the expected future cash flows, over the expected life of the financial instrument, to the net carrying value of the financial asset or liability.
94 OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 1.
Accounting Policies continued f Interest income and expense continued In calculating the EIR the Group estimates the cash flows considering all contractual terms but not future credit losses.
Potential early repayment charges, origination fees received and paid on loans to customers, together with premium discount paid on received on acquired loan books and acquisition costs on loan books are included within loans and advances to customers and are amortised over the expected life of those assets using the EIR method.
Interest income on available for sale investments is included in interest receivable and similar income.
Interest on derivatives is included in interest receivable and similar income or interest expense and similar charges following the underlying instrument it is hedging.
g Fees and commissions Fees and commissions which are an integral part of the EIR of a financial instrument are recognised as an adjustment to the EIR and recorded in interest income.
Other fees and commissions are recognised on the accruals basis as services are provided or on the performance of a significant act, net of VAT and similar taxes.
h Taxation Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
It is recognised in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity, consistently with the recognition of items it relates to.
Current tax is the expected tax charge or credit on the taxable income or loss in the period and any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for accounting purposes and carrying amounts for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise the asset.
The recognition of deferred tax is mainly dependent on the projections of future taxable profits and future reversals of temporary differences.
The current Boards projections of future taxable income assume that the Group will utilise its deferred tax asset within the next 5 years.
i Dividends Dividends are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by shareholders.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, non-restricted balances with central banks and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months from the date of acquisition subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value.
k Intangible assets Purchased software and costs directly associated with the development of computer software are capitalised as intangible assets where the software is a unique and identifiable asset controlled by the Group and will generate future economic benefits.
Costs to establish technological feasibility or to maintain existing levels of performance are recognised as an expense.
Software is amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful life, which is generally five years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
l Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise freehold land and buildings, major alterations to office premises, computer equipment, motor vehicles and fixtures measured at cost less accumulated depreciation.
These assets are reviewed for impairment annually and if they are considered to be impaired are written down immediately to their recoverable amounts.
Gains and losses on disposals calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset are included in profit or loss.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 50 years Leasehold improvements 10 years Equipment, fixtures and vehicles 5 years Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
The cost of repairs and renewals is charged to profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 95 1.
Accounting Policies continued m Financial instruments The Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date on which they originated.
All other financial instruments are accounted for on trade date which is when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group classifies its financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39 and IAS32 into the following categories: i Loans and receivables: which are predominantly mortgage loans, advances to customers and money market advances with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell in the near term.
They are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, less impairment losses.
Where exposures are hedged by derivatives, designated and qualifying as fair value hedges, the fair value adjustment for the hedged risk to the carrying value of the hedged loans and advances is reported in Fair value hedges assets.
ii Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: include derivatives with positive fair values.
Financial assets in this category are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognised in profit or loss.
All changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
iii Available-for-sale AFS financial assets: comprise securities held for liquidity purposes certificates of deposit, treasury bills and money market instruments in the nature of loans and advances to credit institutions.
These assets are non-derivatives that are designated as available-for-sale and not categorised in any other financial asset categories.
These are held at fair value with movements being taken to other comprehensive income and accumulate in the AFS reserve within equity, except for impairment losses which are taken to profit or loss.
When the instrument is sold, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.
iv Financial liabilities: comprise deposits, issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities used as sources of funding.
They include the Sterling Perpetual Subordinated Bond where the terms allow no discretion over the payment of interest.
These financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less direct transaction costs, and subsequently held at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The Group has no financial liabilities held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss except for derivatives with negative fair values.
These financial liabilities are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value, with changes taken to profit or loss.
v Classification as liability or equity: financial instruments that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset on potentially unfavourable conditions are classified as equity.
Equity financial instruments comprise own shares and the Perpetual Subordinated Bond which was issued with terms that include discretion over the payment of interest.
Accordingly, the coupon paid on the bond and related tax effect are recognised directly in retained earning.
vi Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities: financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows have expired and where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
vii Sale and repurchase agreements: financial assets sold subject to repurchase agreements repo are retained in the financial statements if they fail the fide-recognition criteria of IAS 39 described in paragraph vi above.
The financial assets that are retained in the financial statements are reflected as loans or investment securities and the counterparty liability is included in amounts owed to depositors, credit institutions or other customers.
Financial assets purchased under agreements to resell at a pre-determined price where the transaction is financing in nature reverse repo are accounted for as loans and receivables.
The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the lives of agreements using the EIR method.
n Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments interest and basis rate swaps for the purpose of reducing fair value interest rate risk to hedge its exposure to the interest rate risk arising from financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading.
96 OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 1.
Accounting Policies continued n Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Derivative financial instruments are recognised at their fair value with changes in their fair value going through profit or loss.
Fairvalues are calculated by discounting cash flows at the prevailing interest rates.
All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Derivatives covered by master netting agreements are settled and therefore recognised on a net basis.
The Group designates certain derivatives as a hedge of fair value of a portfolio of recognised assets or liabilities macro fair value hedge.
Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way provided the criteria specified in IAS 39 EU endorsed are met.
Where there is an effective hedge relationship for fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk are taken to profit or loss.
The fair value changes of both the hedged item and the derivative substantially offset each other to reduce profit volatility.
To qualify for hedge accounting at inception, the hedge relationship must be clearly documented and the derivative must be expected to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk.
In addition, effectiveness must be tested throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when testing demonstrates that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, the derivative ceases through expiry or sale or the underlying hedged item matures, is sold or is repaid.
If a derivative no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting the cumulative fair value hedging adjustment is amortised over a period up to the maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship.
If the underlying item is sold or repaid the unamortised fair value adjustment is immediately reflected in profit or loss.
o Impairment of financial assets The Group regularly assesses its financial assets valued at amortised cost for impairment.
During the reporting period, the main category within the scope was loans and advances to customers.
The Group individually assesses for impairment loans over 500k which are more than three months in arrears, where LPA receivers are appointed, the property is taken in possession or there are any other events that suggest a high probability of credit loss.
Loans are considered at a connection level, i. e. including all loans belonging to and connected to the customer.
The Group estimates cash flows from these loans, including expected interest and principal payments, rental or sale proceeds, selling costs, etc.
The Group obtains up-to-date independent valuation for properties put up for sale.
If the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate is less than the carrying value of the loan, a specific provision is recognised for the difference.
Such loans are classified as impaired.
If the present value of the estimated future cash flows exceeds the carrying value no provision is recognised.
All loans which do not have a specific provision against them are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Every loan is assigned a one-year probability of default PD and a loss given default LGD generally consistent with the requirements of the Internal Ratings Based IRB Approach, leading to the expected loss EL.
The collective provision is the sum of all ELs.
The calculation uses indexed valuations from ONS statistics applied at a postcode level, as it is usually impossible to request market property valuation for loans not in default.
Different PDs are used for Buy-to-Let mortgages, residential mortgages and unsecured loans.
Interest-only mortgages which are predominantly within the Buy-to-Let segment, are not differentiated further from capital repayment mortgages.
As PDs are generated from historic portfolio performance using a mix of interest-only and repayment loans, they capture the impact of interest-only mortgages as long as the mix remains similar.
The risk of interest-only customers not repaying at maturity is currently not calculated.
The Group has begun to contact customers with upcoming interest-only loan maturities, and tracking responses and outcomes, through specific campaigns since 2014.
Second charge mortgages are considered separately to first charge residential mortgages in that separate PDs are calculated and used in loss calculations based on previous experience of losses on second charge loans.
The LGD calculation on second charge mortgages considers the fact that the holder of the first charge on collateral has first claim on the proceeds of a sale.
Incurred but not reported losses IBNR, where a loss trigger has occurred but the borrower has not yet missed a payment, are captured through the Groups collective provisioning process.
PDs are calculated for loans that are not in arrears based on historic loss data and a provision value is calculated for these accounts.
Loans and the related provision are written off when the underlying security is sold or an unsecured loan customer has not paid for 12 months.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are taken through profit or loss.
The overriding principle when dealing with a borrower in arrears is that the Group follows prescribed policies and procedures that allow for flexibility and an individual approach, tailored to the circumstances of the particular borrower.
The Group offers assistance and a range of tools to act in the best long-term interests of borrowers who are experiencing financial stress.
These are designed to allow customer loans to be brought back into a sustainable position.
Cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being affordable and sustainable for the customer.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 97 1.
Accounting Policies continued The Group will consider all relevant forbearance options when attempting to reach an affordable and sustainable plan with the borrower.
Forbearance is the restructuring of loans to conditions and by means not stipulated under the original contract when the borrower is in financial difficulty.
The specific tools available to assist customers vary by product and the customers status.
The various treatments considered for customers are as follows: Capitalisation of interest: arrears are added to the loan balance and are repaid over the remaining term of the facility or at maturity for interest only products.
A new payment is calculated which will be a higher than the previous payment.
Temporary switch to interest-only: a temporary account change to assist customers through periods of financial difficulty where arrears do not accrue at the original contractual payment.
Any arrears existing at the commencement of the arrangement are retained.
Loan term extension: a permanent account change for customers in financial distress where the overall term of the mortgage is extended, resulting in a lower contractual monthly payment.
Payment holiday: a temporary account change to assist customers through periods of financial difficulty where arrears accrue at the original contractual payment.
Assisted voluntary sale: a period of time is given to allow borrowers to sell the property and arrears accrue based on the contractual payment.
Reduced monthly payments: a temporary arrangement for customers in financial distress.
For example, a short-term arrangement to pay less than the contractual payment.
Arrears continue to accrue based on the contractual payment.
The Group classifies a loan as forborne at the point a concession is granted based on the deteriorated financial status of the borrower.
Accounts are classified as forborne only for the period of time which the loan is known to be, or may still be, in financial difficulty.
When the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulties the loan will revert to standard terms.
If the forbearance eliminates the arrears, the loan is no longer considered past due.
None of the currently used forbearance measures modify the overall cash flows to an extent that requires derecognition of the existing and recognition of a new loan under IAS 39.
Loans that ever had forbearance applied are assigned a higher probability of default in the collective provision calculation.
Forborne accounts are not treated differently in relation to impairments in any other way.
p Debit and credit valuation adjustments The debit and credit valuation adjustments DVA and CVA are included in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The DVA is based on the expected loss a counterparty faces due to the risk of the Groups default.
The CVA reflects the Groups risk of the counterpartys default.
The methodology is based on a standard calculation, taking into account: the one-year probability of default, updated on a regular basis: the expected exposure at default: the expected loss given default: and the average maturity of the swaps.
The funding valuation adjustment FVA is not calculated.
q Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the obligation will be settled and the amount can be estimated reliably.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or present obligations arising from past events which are either not probable or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed unless their probability is remote.
r Employee benefits defined contribution scheme Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension arrangements are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.
s Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments, options granted to employees over the Banks shares under the Groups share-based incentive schemes are measured at fair value at grant and are charged on a straight-line basis to the profit and loss account with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related conditions at the vesting date.
The amount recognised as an expense for awards subject to market conditions is based on the proportion that is expected to meet the condition as assessed at the grant date.
No adjustment is made for the actual proportion that meets the market condition at vesting.
Share-based payments that vest on grant are immediately expensed in full with a corresponding increase in equity.
98 OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 1.
Accounting Policies continued s Share-based payments continued The grant date fair value of a nil price option over the Banks shares which vests at grant or which carries the right to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period IPO share awards is the share price at the grant date.
The grant date fair value of a nil price option over the Banks shares that does not carry automatic rights to dividends or dividend equivalents the Deferred Share Bonus Plan is based on the Banks share price at the grant date adjusted for the impact of the expected dividend yield.
The fair value at grant date of awards made under the Share Save Schemes is determined using a Black-Scholes Option model.
The grant date fair value of nil price options that are subject to non-market conditions and which do not carry automatic rights to dividends or dividend equivalents the EPS element of the Performance Share Plan is based on the share price at the grant date adjusted for the impact of the expected dividend yield.
An assessment is made at each reporting date on the proportion of the awards expected to meet the related market vesting conditions.
The fair value of an option that is subject to market conditions the relative share price element of the Performance Share Plan is determined at grant date using a Monte Carlo model.
Where the allowable cost of share-based awards for tax purposes is greater than the cost determined in accordance with IFRS 2, the tax effect of the excess is taken to equity.
Employers National Insurance is charged to the profit and loss account at the share price at the reporting date on the same vesting schedule as the underlying awards.
t Exceptional IPO expenses Exceptional items are material income or expense items which are non-recurring in nature.
Exceptional items are reported separately in the statement of profit or loss to highlight the core performance of the Group and make it more relevant for comparison with other periods.
The Groups exceptional expenses comprise of IPO related external fees and share awards.
Someof the share awards vested immediately on admission while others vest over various periods of up to four years.
Qualifying costs directly attributable to issuing the primary shares such as advisory and underwriting fees were debited directly to equity.
Costs associated with both the primary and secondary issuance were allocated between profit or loss and equity based on the number of primary and secondary shares.
Other non-qualifying costs were taken to profit and loss.
Exceptional IPO share awards which vested on IPO and related national insurance contributions were expensed immediately.
The awards with vesting periods along with the accruing national insurance are expensed on an on-going basis in profit and loss and continue to be presented as exceptional items.
Further detail on accounting for share-based payments is disclosed in notes above.
u Securitisation At the reporting date, the Group had one securitisation scheme administered through Rochester Financing No.
1 Plc special purpose entity SPE.
The Group assessed whether it controls the SPE and therefore should consolidate it under criteria of IFRS 10.
The criteria include the power to direct relevant activities, exposure or rights to variable returns and the ability to use its power to affect the amount of these returns.
The Group has the power to appoint directors and control daily operations of its SPE through securitisation documents.
It owns the certificates which give rights to the residual interest income remaining after servicing the external debt.
It has the ability to affect the amount of outgoing payments if required.
On this basis, Rochester Financing No.
1 Plc is considered a wholly owned subsidiary and consolidated in the Groups operations.
The Bank has retained the risks and rewards of ownership in respect of the loans transferred to Rochester Financing No.
1 Plc, therefore, they fail derecognition criteria and remain in its assets.
Whilst the securitisation entity has been consolidated as a 100% subsidiary, the mortgage loans included within the securitisation structure are ring-fenced, with the cash flows being used to repay its liabilities in line with the priority of payments set out in the securitisation prospectus.
The senior debt is held externally while junior debt and residual certificates are retained by the Bank.
The Group statement of financial position shows externally held notes as debt securities in issue.
v Judgements in applying accounting policies and critical accounting estimates In preparing these financial statements, the Group has made judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts within the current and next financial year.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed based on past experience, expectations of future events and other factors.
The key areas where estimates and judgements are made are as follows: Strategic report Governance Financial statements OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 99 1.
Accounting Policies continued i Loan book impairments: Specific provision assessments for individually significant loans or portfolios of loans involve significant judgment in relation to estimating future cash flows, including the cost of obtaining and selling collateral, the likely sale proceeds and any rental income prior to sale.
The most critical estimate is the level of house prices where a variance of 10% equates to a change of 2.7m 2014: 4.6m in the provision.
All assets without a specific provision are assessed collectively.
Collective provisions are calculated using twelve month delinquency roll rates and one year probability of defaults on different segments of the loan book.
These rates along with forced sale discounts and the level of house prices are applied to calculate expected losses.
Judgement is exercised in deciding how to apply historic experience to current market conditions.
The most critical estimate is the level of house prices where a variance of 10% applied to the calculation of the loss given default equates to a change of 3.2m 2014: 2.4m in the provision.
The impact of house price variances on the probability of default is difficult to quantify but could be material.
ii Loan book acquisition accounting and income recognition: Acquired loan books are initially recognised at fair value.
Significant judgement is exercised in calculating their effective interest rate EIR using cash flow models which include assumptions on the likely macroeconomic environment, including HPI, unemployment levels and interest rates, as well as loan level and portfolio attributes and history used to derive prepayment rates, the probability and timing of defaults and the amount of incurred losses.
iii Effective interest rate: A number of assumptions are made when calculating the effective interest rate for newly originated loan assets.
These include their expected lives, likely redemption profiles and the anticipated level of any early redemption charges.
Directly attributable fees is a significant element of the effective interest rate of the BTL products and is recognised in profit and loss over the expected life of the loans.
Judgement is used in assessing the expected life of products with an initial discounted or fixed period which then revert to the standard variable rate.
The impact of a 6 month longer expected life on 2015 new origination, that is expected to reach the end of the discounted or fixed period, would be to recognise an additional 1.1m 2014: 1.0m of interest income as the impact of spreading fee income over a longer period is more than offset by the impact of a higher revert rate for the additional period.
w Adoption of new standards During the year the Group adopted Annual Improvements to IFRSs, 2010 to 2012 and 2011 to 2013 cycles, all effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, consisting of minor amendments to existing standards.
The annual improvement cycles did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.
The new standards and amendments below have not been yet endorsed by the EU and therefore have not been applied in preparing these financial statements: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective from 1 January 2018, replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 introduces a different classification of financial assets based on the entitys business model and the cash flow characteristics of the instruments.
IFRS 9 will replace the existing incurred loss impairment approach with an expected credit loss approach.
Under this approach at initial recognition of a loan, an allowance is required for expected credit losses ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months.
In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed for each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument, rather than by considering an increase in ECL.
The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL must be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date.
IFRS 9 is expected to have a significant impact on operations particularly in the risk and finance functions of the Group.
The appropriate governance framework will also be established to review ECLs, models used, and judgements made.
The Group is completing its impact assessment phase and is planning to commence its design and modelling phase in the first quarter of 2016.
The Group will engage external consultants to work alongside existing teams to complete the development ofIFRS 9 models, controls and procedures by the end of 2016 that will allow OSB to parallel run and test IFRS 9 models during2017.
Hedge accounting will become more closely aligned with risk management practices under IFRS 9.
The Group has elected to continue with IAS 39 hedging that is an option under IFRS 9 until a separate IASB project to address macro hedge accounting strategies is finalised and can be assessed.
Whilst at this stage the Group expects to continue with IAS 39 hedge accounting, it will implement the revised hedge accounting disclosures required by the related amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
At this stage it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of IFRS 9, however the Group will provide a further update in the 2016 annual report and should be in a position to provide initial quantitative indications during 2017.
100 OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 1.
Accounting Policies continued w Adoption of new standards continued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective from 1 January 2018, replaces IAS 11 Construction contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and several related interpretations.
It introduces a single framework for revenue recognition based on new concepts and principles.
The new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases, effective from 1 January 2019, replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease and two related SIC interpretations.
The new standard requires the lessees to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases over 12 months long.
Lessor accounting has largely remained unchanged.
Adoption of IFRS 16 in respect of rented properties is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements.

Their fair value adjustment at the time of hedge termination continues to be amortised over the original hedging term.
Unmatched swaps are derivatives that do not form part of a hedging relationship.
The debit valuation adjustment DVA is calculated on the Groups derivative liabilities and represents exposure of their holders to the risk of the Groups default.
The credit valuation adjustment CVA reflects the Groups risk of the counterpartys default.

A proportion of these awards vested on admission with the remainder vesting over either a 12, 24 or 48 month period.
The cost of IPO Share Awards based on their fair value at grant date of 170 pence per share the IPO offer price is recognised over the respective vesting period adjusted for expected attrition with awards that vested on admission being immediately expensed in full.
The expense is reported within exceptional IPO expenses in the statement of profit or loss and is offset fully by an additional capital contribution as the awards were granted by OSB Holdco Ltd, the Banks major shareholder.
OSB Sharesave Scheme The Save As You Earn SAYE or Sharesave Schemes are open to all UK based employees and allow them to save a fixed amount of between 5 and 500 per month over either three or five years in order to use these savings at the end of the qualifying period to buy the Banks shares at a fixed price established when the schemes were announced.

The charge in respect of awards with future vesting provisions assumed a weighted average attrition of nil 2014: 2.6%.
This is lower than the overall expected staff attrition rate as nil attrition was assumed for certain Senior Managers who received larger awards.
Sharesave Schemes The grant date fair values of options under the Sharesave Schemes were determined using a Black-Scholes model.
This determined the fair value of options over 1 ordinary share in the 2015 3 and 5 year Sharesave Schemes as 17 pence and 19 pence respectively 2014: 31 pence and 34 pence, using the following assumptions: 2015 2014 Contractual life, years 3 5 years 3 5 years Share price at issue, 2.84 1.60 1 Expected volatility 20% 20% Attrition rate 9.6% 10.5% Dividend yield 3.6% 3% 1 The volatility was based on a benchmark of the FTSE 350 diversified financials as insufficient history was available for the Banks Shares.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The grant date fair value of nil price options under the deferred share plan of 226 pence per share is based on the mid-market share price at the grant date of 251 pence per share, adjusted for the impact of dividends, as the options dont carry automatic rights to dividends.
A dividend yield of 3.7% was used based on available analyst consensus.
The expense for 2015 assumes an attrition rate of 9.1%.
Performance Share Plan The grant date fair value of nil price options under the performance share plan PSP of 226 pence per share is based on the mid-market share price at the grant date of 251 pence per share, adjusted for the impact of dividends, as the options dont carry automatic rights to dividends.
A dividend yield of 3.7% was assumed based on available analyst consensus.
A vesting rate of 100% was assumed as at 31 December 2015 for the EPS element of the PSP, based on the expectation that the required target growth will be achieved over the vesting period.
A vesting rate of 50% was assumed for the total shareholder return element of the PSP, based on a Monte Carlo model using historical share price performance data for the target benchmark FTSE all share index excluding Investment Trusts and the FTSE 350.

This results in a weighted average rate for the year of 20.25% 2014: 21.5%.
In the 2015 Summer Budget, the UK Government announced the reduction of the main corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% from 1 April 2020.
As these rates were substantively enacted at 31 December 2015, the deferred tax has been calculated using the relevant rates for the expected periods of utilisation.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group has 4.8m 2014: 4.8m of losses for which deferred tax assets had not been recognised.
The Government also announced an additional 8% surcharge on banking profits over 25m, effective from 1 January 2016.
The Banks profits are expected to be subject to the surcharge however, subsidiaries profits are not, which means their losses of prior years will not attract an additional tax relief.
The deferred tax calculation does not take into account the surcharge effect.

1 Plc Rochester and sold to third-party investors in 2013.
Rochester is a mortgage securitisation entity established by the Bank in 2013.
The Bank retained the remaining notes and residual certificates issued by Rochester and as such did not transfer substantially the risks and rewards of ownership of the securitised mortgages.
These mortgages therefore remain on the Banks balance sheet and the Group consolidates Rochester.
The notes sold originally had a nominal value of 273m, paid down to 188m as at 31 December 2015, and a final maturity date of July 2046, however the interest payable on the notes steps up from January 2018, with the holder of the majority of the residual certificates currently the Bank having the right to redeem the outstanding notes from this date.
The Bank has an incentive to call at the step up date and the outstanding debt securities are expected to be settled at that date.

FSCS and other provisions The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS provides protection of deposits for the customers of authorised financial services firms, should a firm collapse.
FSCS protects retail deposits of up to 85,000 for single account holders and up to 170,000 for joint holders.
From the 1 January 2016, the protection decreases to 75,000 for single accounts holders and up to 150,000 for joint holders.
The compensation paid out to consumers is initially funded through loans from the Bank of England and HM Treasury.
In order to repay the loans and cover its costs, the FSCS charges levies on firms regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority.
The Group is among those firms and pays FSCS a levy based on its share of total UK deposits.
The FSCS levy is the main regulatory provision of the Group.
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the insolvencies cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.

In 2014, the Group reorganised its share capital in order to prepare for the public listing.
The reorganisation involved an issue of interim shares, conversion, bonus issue and change of denomination.
Ordinary B, E and preference shares regardless of nominal value were exchanged for the new 0.01 ordinary shares on a one-for-200 basis.
Ordinary A shares were exchanged for 0.7m new shares, a proportion of about one A share for 26 new shares.
Ordinary B shares issued by OSB IGH Limited in connection with the Interbay acquisition and E shares issued by the Bank in connection with the Prestige acquisition with immaterial nominal value had value enhancement in the form of a put call agreement with the sellers and loss protection provided by OSB Holdco Ltd, the Group shareholder.
The value enhancement of 3.3m had been recognised as capital contribution.
Before the IPO, OSB Holdco Ltd bought out B and E shares at no cost to the Group.
The shares were cancelled and their value enhancement kept in the capital contribution reserve, was reclassified to retained earnings.
During the IPO the Group issued and sold to the public 24.4m shares at 1.70 per share.
The capital reorganisation reduced KRPSs holding in the ordinary share capital of the Group to under 1%.
As part of the reorganisation KRPS received an additional allocation of ordinary shares from OSB Holdco Ltd as consideration for the Banks buy-out of the agency agreement to run a number of branches for the Bank in 2013.
This transaction settled the Banks liability of 0.7m and is recorded as a capital contribution in the statement of equity.
Perpetual Subordinated Bonds In addition to the PSBs in note 30, the Bank has issued 22m PSBs which are classified as equity, as full discretion can be exercised by the Directors over the payment of the coupon.
The classification of these PSBs means that any coupon payments on them are treated within retained earnings rather than through profit or loss.
Transfer reserve The transfer reserve of 12.8m Bank: 15.2m represents the difference between the true value of net assets transferred to the Group from Kent Reliance Building Society in 2011 and the value of shares issued to the A ordinary shareholders.
AFS reserve The AFS reserve of 0.1 m 2014: 0.8m represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income net of deferred tax.

Risk management and financial instruments Overview Financial instruments form the vast majority of the Groups and Banks assets and liabilities.
The Group manages risk on a consolidated basis, and risk disclosures are provided on this basis.
Types of financial instrument Financial instruments are a broad definition which includes financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments.
The main financial assets of the Group are loans to customers and liquid assets which in turn consist of cash in the Bank of England Reserve account, call accounts with other credit institutions and UK and EU sovereign debt.
These are funded by a combination of financial liabilities and equity instruments.
Financial liability funding comes predominantly from retail deposits, supported by debt securities, subordinated debt, wholesale and other funding.
Equity instruments include own shares and perpetual bonds meeting the equity classification criteria.
The Groups main activity is mortgage and personal lending: it raises funds or invests in particular types of financial assets primarily in order to satisfy banking industry regulations and manage the risks arising from its operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its financial risks.
Derivative financial instruments derivatives are financial instruments which value changes in response to changes in underlying variables such as interest rates, commodity or security prices, or indices.
Typically the contract value of derivatives is much smaller than that of the instruments they relate to which makes them a convenient tool for benefiting from value changes without the need to buy or sell the whole underlying product.
The most common derivatives comprise futures, forwards and swaps.
Among these, the Group only uses swaps.
Derivatives are used by the Group solely to reduce hedge the risk of loss arising from changes in market factors.
Derivatives are not used for speculative purposes.
Types of derivatives and uses The derivative instruments used by the Group in managing its risk exposures are interest rate swaps and basis rate swaps.
Interest rate swaps convert fixed interest rates to floating or vice versa.
Basis rate swaps perform a similar function by converting cash flows from one interest rate basis to another.
As with other derivatives, the underlying product is not sold and payments are based on notional principal amounts.
Unhedged fixed rate liabilities create the risk of paying above-the-market rate if interest rates subsequently decrease.
Unhedged fixed rate mortgages and liquid assets bear the opposite risk of earning below-the-market income when rates go up.
While fixed rate assets and liabilities naturally hedge each other to a certain extent, this hedge is usually never balanced.
The Group uses swaps to convert its instruments, such as mortgages, deposits and liquid assets, from fixed or base rate-linked rates to LIBOR-linked variable rates.
This ensures a guaranteed margin between the interest income and interest expense, regardless of changes in the market rates.

Risk management and financial instruments continued Types of risk The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are credit, liquidity and market risks, the latter comprising of interest and exchange rate risk.
In addition to financial risks, the Group is exposed to various other risks, most notably operational, conduct and regulatory, covered in the Chief Risk Officers Report.
The financial risks are analysed below.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that unexpected losses may arise as a result of the Groups borrowers or market counterparties failing to meet their obligations to repay.
The Group has adopted the Standardised Approach for assessment of credit risk capital requirements.
This approach considers risk weightings as defined under Basel II and Basel III principles.
The classes of financial instruments to which the Group is most exposed are loans and advances to customers, loans and advances to credit institutions, cash in the Bank of England Reserve account, call and current accounts with other credit institutions and investment securities.
The maximum credit risk exposure equals to the total carrying amount of the above categories plus off-balance sheet undrawn mortgage facilities.
Credit risk loans and advances to customers Credit risk associated with mortgage lending is largely driven by the housing market and level of unemployment.
A recession and or high interest rates could cause pressure within the market, resulting in rising levels of arrears and repossessions.
All loan applications are assessed with reference to the Groups Lending Policy.
Changes to the policy are approved by the Board, with mandates set for the approval of loan applications.
The Credit Committee and the ALCO regularly monitor lending activity, taking appropriate actions to re-price products and adjust lending criteria in order to control risk and manage exposure.
Where necessary and appropriate, changes to the Lending Policy are recommended to the Risk Committee and the Board.

Risk management and financial instruments continued Credit risk investment securities and loans and advances to credit institutions The Group holds treasury instruments in order to meet liquidity requirements and for general business purposes.
The credit risk arising from these investments is closely monitored and managed by the Groups Treasury department.
In managing these assets, Group treasury operates within guidelines laid down in the Treasury Policy approved by the Board and performance is monitored and reported to ALCO monthly, including through the use of an internally developed rating model based on counterparty credit default swap spreads.
The Group has limited exposure to emerging markets Indian operations and non-investment-grade debt.
The ALCO is responsible for approving Treasury counterparties.
During the year, the average balance of cash in hand, loans and advances to credit institutions and investment securities on a monthly basis was 702,970k 2014: 753,921k.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 127 33.
To avoid refinancing risks associated with any one counterparty, sector or geographical region, the Board has set appropriate limits.
These are contained in the Treasury Policy.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient liquid assets to fulfil obligations as they become due or the cost of raising liquid funds becoming too expensive.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to cover cash flow imbalances and fluctuations in funding in order to retain full public confidence in the solvency of the Group and to enable the Group to meet its financial obligations.
This is achieved through maintaining a prudent level of liquid assets and control of the growth of the business.
The Group has established a Reserve account with the Bank of England and has access to its Contingent Liquidity Facilities.
Liquidity management is the responsibility of the ALCO, with day-to-day management delegated to Treasury as detailed in the Treasury Policy.
The ALCO is responsible for setting limits over the level and maturity profile of wholesale funding and for monitoring the composition of the Group financial position.
For each material class of financial liability a contractual maturity analysis is provided in notes 23 to 29.
An Asset Encumbrance Policy has also been approved with encumbrance levels monitored monthly at ALCO.
The Group also monitors a range of numeric triggers, defined in the Contingency Funding Plan CFP and Recovery and Resolution Plan RRP, which are designed to capture liquidity stresses in advance in order to allow sufficient time for management action to take effect.

Risk management and financial instruments continued Market risk Market risk is the risk of an adverse change in Group income or the Groups net worth arising from movement in interest rates, exchange rates or other market prices.
Market risk exists, to some extent, in all the Groups businesses.
The Group recognises that the effective management of market risk is essential to the maintenance of stable earnings and preservation of shareholder value.
Interest rate risk The primary market risk faced by the Group is interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
It is most prevalent in mortgage lending where fixed rate mortgages are not funded by fixed rate deposits of the same duration, or where the fixed rate risk is not hedged by a fully matching interest rate derivative.
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates reflecting the mismatch between the dates on which interest receivable on assets and interest payable on liabilities are next reset to market rates or, if earlier, the dates on which the instruments mature.
The Group measures Interest Rate risk using fourteen different interest rate curve shift scenarios designed to emulate a full range of market movements.
These fourteen scenarios are defined by ALCO and are based on three shapes of curve movement shift, twist, and flex with movements in rates scaled to approximate the potential move over one year at 99.9% two-tailed confidence interval with interest rates floored to zero.
In addition, the regulatory scenario of an un-floored parallel shift of 200bps in both directions is applied.
Exposure is mitigated on a continuous basis through the use of derivatives within limits set by the ALCO and the Board currently 1.5% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.
After taking into account the derivatives entered into by the Group and reserve allocations a parallel interest rate movement of 2% would have an impact of 0.2m 2014: 2.4m gain in the statement of profit or loss and 0.2m 2014: 0.9m in equity.
There is no material difference between the interest rate risk profile for the Group and that for the Bank.
Foreign exchange rate risk The Group has limited exposure to foreign exchange risk in respect of its Indian operations.
A 5% movement in exchange rates would result in 0.1m 2014: 0.1m effect in profit and loss and 0.2m 2014: 0.2m in equity.
The Bank is not exposed to foreign exchange risk since all its assets and liabilities are expressed in pounds sterling.
Structured entities The only structured entity within the Group, Rochester Financing No.
1 Plc Rochester, holds legal title to a pool of mortgages which are used as a security for issued debt.
The transfer of mortgages fails derecognition criteria because the Bank retained the remaining notes and residual certificates issued and as such did not transfer substantially the risks and rewards of ownership of the securitised mortgages.
Therefore, the Group is exposed to the credit, interest rate and other risks on the securitised mortgages to the same extent as on the other mortgages.
It mitigates these risks on a Group basis as discussed throughout this note.
Cash flows generated from the mortgages securitised within Rochester Financing No.
1 Plc are ring-fenced, i. e. can only be used to pay interest and principal of the issued debt securities in a waterfall order according to the seniority of bonds.
The securitisation vehicle is self-funded and the Group is not contractually or constructively obliged to provide it further liquidity or financial support.
The maximum loss exposure at any point in time is the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in Rochester.
Fair value adjustments for hedged risk This represents the fair value adjustments to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities as a result of portfolio hedging.

Risk management and financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following tables give a comparison of book and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date.
In the absence of such agreements a grossing up adjustment of 2.4m 2014: 3.3m would be required.
132 OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 33.
Risk management and financial instruments continued Fair values are determined using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance and observability of the inputs used in making the measurements: Level 1 These are valuation techniques that are based entirely on quoted market prices in an actively traded market and are the most reliable.
Level 2 These are valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are taken from observable market data.
These include valuation models used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows and may be employed either when no active market exists or when there are quoted prices available for similar instruments in active markets.
The management use LIBOR curves to value its derivatives, however, using OIS curves would not materially change their value.
The fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments incorporates credit valuation adjustments CVA and debit valuation adjustments DVA.
The DVA and CVA take into account the respective credit ratings and whether the derivative is collateralised or not.
In considering which similar instruments to use, management take into account the sensitivity of the instrument to changes in market rates and the credit quality of the instrument.
Basis risk derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow models and observable market data and will be sensitive to benchmark interest rate curves.
Level 3 These are valuation techniques for which any one or more significant input is not based on observable market data.
Valuation techniques for level 3 instruments may include net present value models, comparison to similar instruments with observable prices, Black-Scholes and other methods.
As disclosed in the tables above, financial instruments with fair value measured at level 3 include loans and advances to customers and debt securities in issue.
Neither loans to customers nor debt securities in issue are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.
Loans to customers belong to this level because their valuation uses unobservable inputs on collectability rates and redemption profiles.
Their fair value is calculated using modelled receipts of interest and principal which are discounted at market rates.
Debt securities in issue are classified as level 3 because their principal is repaid using the cash flows from the underlying securitised mortgages, which in turn use the same unobservable inputs on collectability rates and redemption profiles.
The fair value of issued debt securities is calculated using modelled payments of interest and principal discounted at market rates for similar instruments.
Pension scheme Defined contribution scheme The amount charged to profit or loss in respect of contributions to the Groups defined contribution and stakeholder pension arrangements is the contribution payable in the period.
The total pension cost in the year amounted to 1,082k 2014: 871k.
Defined benefit scheme KRBS operated a defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme funded by the payment of contributions to a separately administered fund for nine retired members.
The Societys Board decided to close the Scheme with effect from 31 December 2001 and introduced a new defined contribution scheme to cover service of Scheme members from 1 January 2002.
The Scheme Trustees, having taken actuarial advice, decided to wind up the Scheme rather than continue to operate it on a paid up basis.
The winding up is largely complete.
As at 31 December 2015 the liability to remaining members is 2k 31 December 2014: 2k matched by Scheme assets.
Capital Management The Group is governed by its Capital Management Policy.
The objectives of the Banks Capital Management Policy are to efficiently manage the capital base to optimise shareholder returns whilst maintaining capital adequacy and satisfying key stakeholders such as customers and regulators.
The Banks prime objectives in relation to the management of capital are to comply with the requirements set out by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA, the Banks primary prudential supervisor, to provide a sufficient capital base to cover business risks and support future business development.
Capital management is based on the three pillars of Basel II: Under Pillar 1, the Bank calculates its minimum capital requirements based on 8% of risk weighted assets.
The Prudential Regulation Authority then applies a multiplier to this amount to cover risks under Pillar 2 of Basel II and generate an Individual Capital Guidance ICG.
As instructed by the PRA, the Bank manages and reports its capital on a solo consolidated basis and hence the Banks capital position is not disclosed separately.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements OneSavings Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 133 35.
Capital Management continued The groups Pillar 1 capital information is presented in this note.
To comply with Pillar 2, the group completes an annual selfassessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP reviewed by the PRA.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website.
On 1 January 2014, a new set of rules, Basel III came into force through the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation CRD IV.
Basel III complements and enhances Basels I and II with additional safety measures.
Basel III changed definitions of regulatory capital, introduced new capital buffers and liquidity ratios, and modified the way regulatory capital is calculated.
The ultimate responsibility for capital adequacy rests with the Board of Directors.
The Banks ALCO, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior executives, is responsible for the management of the capital process including approving policy, overseeing internal controls and setting internal limits over capital ratios.
The Bank actively manages its capital position and reports this on a regular basis to senior management via the ALCO and other governance committees.
Capital requirements are included within budgets, reforecast and strategic plans with initiatives being executed against this plan.
During the period the Group complied with the capital requirements set out by the PRA.
