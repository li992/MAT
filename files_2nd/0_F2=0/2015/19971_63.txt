Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
Financial risk management is primarily carried out by the Group Treasurer under risk management policies approved by the Board of directors and supervised by the CFO.
The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Strategic Report on page 46.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group comprise liquidity risk, financing risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and pensions risk.
These risks are managed as described below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group has insufficient funds available to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups business generates strong operating cash flows and the Group aims to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet its anticipated working capital requirements based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts.
Liquidity requirements that cannot be met from operational cash flow or existing cash resources are satisfied by drawings under the Groups RCF.
The Group maintains adequate committed but undrawn facilities to meet such requirements.
Details of the Groups borrowing arrangements are provided in note 20.

Financial risk management 125 Financial statements The table below details the Groups expected maturity for its derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial instruments including interest that will be receivable or payable on them.
Where applicable, interest payments in respect of the floating rate liabilities are estimated based on the one month sterling LIBOR rate at the period end date.

Capital management and financing risk The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern, supports its business strategy and takes into account the wider economic environment.
The Groups capital comprises equity and debt finance and these elements are managed to balance the requirements of the business and the interests of shareholders and debt stakeholders.
The Group manages its capital structure through cash flows from operations, returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy backs, the raising or repayment of debt and the raising of equity capital from investors.
Financing risk is the risk that the Group is unable to access sufficient finance to refinance its debt obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages this risk by maintaining a balance between different funding sources including equity and debt.
It seeks to mitigate its debt financing risk by diversifying its sources of loan finance.
The bank loan and corporate bond markets are currently used for this purpose.
The Board also seeks to mitigate the Groups refinancing risk by having an appropriately balanced debt maturity profile.
Net debt to EBITDA ratio The Group assesses its debt capital structure primarily through use of the net debt to EBITDA ratio.
As one of the financial covenants under its bank loan facility, the Group must ensure that its net debt to rolling 12-month EBITDA does not exceed 3.5 times.
Based on current forecasts, the Group expects to operate within these covenant limits throughout the lifetime of the facility.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio was: 29 December 30 December 2015 2014 m m Nominal value of bank loans 50.0 Nominal value of corporate bonds 675.0 675.0 Counter indemnity obligations under bank guarantees 3.4 3.2 Cash excluding customer balances and other restricted cash 190.2 125.4 Net debt for covenant purposes 488.2 602.8 EBITDA for covenant purposes 372.1 445.4 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.3 1.4 For the purposes of bank loan covenants, EBITDA is calculated as pre-exceptional profit before depreciation, amortisation, interest, tax and share-based payments.
William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21.
Financial risk management 126 Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties defaulting on their obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
It arises in relation to transactions with commercial counterparties and to transactions with financial institutions with which the Group deposits its surplus funds and from counterparties with which the Group has entered into derivative financial transactions for hedging purposes.
It also arises from customers who have been granted credit with which to bet with the Group.
The Group manages its financial counterparty credit risk by limiting or otherwise closely monitoring the amount that can be deposited with any one institution and by restricting the counterparties with which it will deposit funds to institutions with specified minimum credit ratings or which meet specified criteria.
The Groups policy is to mitigate its credit risk with respect to derivative transactions by using a number of different counterparties for material transactions.
As at 29 December 2015, the Group had only entered into immaterial derivative contracts for currency hedging purposes.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups borrowings.
The Group has a policy which aims to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate debt exposures appropriate to the expected performance of the business, the Groups debt burden and the wider economic environment.
The Board has approved a fixed interest rate exposure target range of between 50% and 75% but with substantial flexibility around this range to allow for changing circumstances.
At 29 December 2015, all of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates.
Based on the current level of borrowings, a 100 basis points change in interest rates would have the following impact on the Group financial statements: Increase of Decrease of 100 basis 100 basis points points m m Increase decrease in profit 2.9 1.4 Increase decrease in equity reserves 2.9 1.4 Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk through transactions undertaken in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to hedge transaction exposures on a case-by-case basis, depending on materiality, at a Group or subsidiary operating level.
Current levels of transaction exposure are not considered to be material, although the Online division has hedged a proportion of its exposure to the Israeli Shekel and Philippine Peso costs of its operations using currency forward transactions as described in note 23.
The Groups reporting currency is pounds sterling and it is therefore also exposed to translation risk from its business in Australia operating in Australian dollars, its businesses in Europe operating in Euros and its business in the US operating in US dollars.
The Group does not hedge accounting translation exposures and accepts the economic risks of operating internationally.
Revenue by currency Revenue by currency is analysed below.
52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 29 December 30 December 2015 2014 % % Sterling 84.5 82.5 Australian dollar 6.2 7.6 Euro 5.2 5.6 Other currencies 4.1 4.3 Total 100.0 100.0 Pensions risk The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
Pensions risk arises in respect of the defined benefit scheme where the cost of funding retirement benefits ultimately falls upon the Group.
The last triennial actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2013 showed a funding deficit on the defined benefit scheme of 47.4m.
The Group has agreed to make deficit repair contributions of 9.4m per annum until May 2019.
In addition, it contributes 1.9m per annum towards the cost of insured death benefits and other administrative expenses of running the scheme.
The Group seeks to manage the cash flow impact arising from pensions risk.
Accordingly, the defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002 and was restricted as to future accrual from April 2011.
The Group attempts to further manage its exposure by agreeing with the Pension Scheme Trustees the assumptions to be used to calculate the scheme liabilities, the investment strategy to be followed and any cash contributions to be made by the Group.
