237135 Finsbury Growth & Inc pp70-imp INF 14 12 2015 11:03 Page 83 Finsbury Growth & Income Trust PLC 83 Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2015 Further Information Explanatory Notes of Principal Changes to the Companys Articles of Association Set out below is a summary of the main differences between the current and the proposed new Articles of Association the Articles.
The principal changes in the new Articles to be adopted at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 4 February 2016 relate to: FATCA The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act 2010 of the United States of America commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and all associated regulations and official guidance FATCA imposes a system of information reporting on certain entities including foreign financial institutions such as the Company following the enactment of the UK International Tax Compliance United States of America Regulations 2013 on 1 September 2013.
These regulations have now been replaced by the International Tax Compliance Regulations 2015 which also include the automatic exchange of information regimes being brought in under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Union.
The Articles of Association have therefore been amended in order to provide the Company with the ability to require shareholders to co-operate in respect of these broader obligations and not just with its obligations under FATCA as is currently the case.
Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 As part of the Governments Trust and Transparency reforms, the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 the SBEEA provided that companies were no longer able to create bearer shares with effect from 26 May 2015.
The Companies Act 2006 was also amended to prohibit the creation of bearer shares.
Although the Company has not issued any Share warrants to bearers, the proposed changes to the Companys articles of association remove any inconsistencies with the SBEEA and the Companies Act 2006 in this regard.
