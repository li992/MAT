Our Financials Group Notes Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The Annual Report and Accounts of IP Group plc IP Group or the Company and its subsidiary companies together, the Group are for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in the most appropriate selection of the Groups accounting policies.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 3.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the directors are satisfied that the Group and parent Company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
In making this assessment, the directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources.
Changes in accounting policies i New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2015 No new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2015 have had a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
ii New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective The following new standards, which have not been applied in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the Groups future financial statements: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued on 28 May 2014 and provides a single global standard on revenue recognition which aligns the IFRS and US GAAP guidance.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
The Group has assessed the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 15 and does not foresee any material effect when the Standard is applied.
While early adoption is permitted, IFRS 15 has an effective date of 1 January 2018 with the year ending 31 December 2018 being the first annual financial statements to which the standard applies.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety.
The process has been divided into three main components, being classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
The Group provisionally assesses the potential effect to be immaterial given the majority of its financial assets are currently held at fair value through profit or loss.
The current proposed effective date is 1 January 2018.
None of the other new standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective are expected to have a material effect on the Groups future financial statements.
Basis of consolidation i Business Combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method from the date that control is transferred to the Group see ii Subsidiaries below.
Both the identifiable net assets and the consideration transferred in the acquisition are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is tested annually for impairment.
In instances where the Group owns a non-controlling stake prior to acquisition the step acquisition method is applied, and any gain or losses on the fair value of the pre-acquisition holding is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
com 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued ii Subsidiaries Where the Group has control over an entity, it is classified as a subsidiary.
As per IFRS 10, an entity is classed as under the control of the Group when all three of the following elements are present: power over the entity: exposure to variable returns from the entity: and the ability of the Group to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
In situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding the majority of the voting rights, it is considered that fide facto control exists.
In determining whether fide facto control exists the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: The size of the Companys voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights: Substantive potential voting rights held by the company and by other parties: Other contractual arrangements: and Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Contingent liabilities dependent on the disposed value of an associated investment are only recognised when the fair value is above the associated threshold.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are consolidated until the date on which control ceases.
iii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
No associates are presented on the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group elects to hold such investments at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, which permits investments held by entities that are akin to venture capital organisations to be excluded from its measurement methodology requirements where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Changes in fair value of associates are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
The disclosures required by Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 for associated undertakings are included in Note 11 of the Company financial statements to these financial statements.
Similarly, those investments which may not have qualified as Associate but fall within the wider scope of significant holdings and so are subject to Section 409 disclosure acts are also included in Note 11 of the Company financial statements.
iv Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships Limited Partnerships Limited Partnerships Group entities act as general partner and investment manager to the following Limited Partnerships: Interest in limited partnership Name % IP Venture Fund II LP IPVFII 33.3 IP Venture Fund IPVF 10.0 The North East Technology Fund LP NETF 104 IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Our Financials Group Notes The Group receives compensation for its role as investment manager to these Limited Partnerships including fixed fees and performance fees.
The directors consider that these amounts are in substance and form normal market rate compensation for its role as investment manager.
In order to determine whether these Limited Partnerships were required to be consolidated, the presence of the three elements of control noted in part ii was examined.
The Groups significant stake in IPVFII creates a significant exposure to the variability of returns from those interests and the Groups ability to direct the operations of the fund would result in IP Group obtaining the benefits of its activities.
As such, IPVFII meets the criteria in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and is consequently consolidated.
In the case of IPVF, the directors consider that the minority Limited Partnership interest does not create an exposure of such significance that it indicates that the Group acts as anything other than agent for the other Limited Partners in the arrangement.
This is further supported by the presence of a strict investment policy and the inability for the general partner to change the restrictive terms of that policy other than with agreement of 100% of IPVFs Limited Partners.
Similarly, the lack of a stake in NETF indicates the Groups role as an agent for the limited partner.
As a result, the Directors consider that the Group does not have the power to govern the operations of these limited partnerships so as to obtain benefits from their activities and accordingly do not meet the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
However the Group does have the power to exercise significant influence over its limited partnerships and accordingly the Groups accounting treatment for the interest in IPVF is consistent with that of associates as described earlier in this report, i. e. in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and designated as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Limited Liability Partnerships The Group has a 17.9% interest in the total capital commitments of Technikos LLP Technikos.
The general partner and investment manager of Technikos are parties external to the Group.
v Non-controlling interests The total comprehensive income, assets and liabilities of non-wholly owned subsidiaries are attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Portfolio return and revenue Change in fair value Change in fair value of equity and debt investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups portfolio of investments.
Gains on disposal of equity investments represent the difference between the fair value of consideration received and the carrying value at the start of the accounting period on the disposal of equity investments.
Change in fair value of Limited Partnership investments represents revaluation gains and losses on the Groups investments in Limited Partnership funds.
Changes in fair values of assets do not constitute revenue.
Revenue from services and other income All revenue from services is generated within the United Kingdom and is stated exclusive of value added tax.
Revenue from services and other income comprises: Advisory fees: Fees earned from the provision of business support services are recognised as the related services are provided.
Corporate finance advisory fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds raised and recognised at the time the related transaction is successfully concluded.
In some instances, these fees are settled via the issue of equity in the company receiving the corporate finance services at the same price per share as equity issued as part the financing round to which the advisory fees apply.
Accounting Policies continued Fund management services: Fiduciary fund management fees are generally earned as a fixed percentage of total funds under management and are recognised as the related services are provided.
Licence income: Income from licensing and similar income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements.
Income from milestone income is recognised once performance obligations are satisfied, on an accruals basis and in accordance with the terms of the relevant licensing agreements.
Dividends: Dividends receivable from equity shares are included within other portfolio income and recognised on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings Over 3 to 5 years Computer equipment Over 3 to 5 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and allocated from the acquisition date to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
Goodwill may be allocated to CGUs in both the acquired business and in the existing business.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets represents contractual arrangements and memorandums of understanding with four UK universities acquired through acquisition of a subsidiary.
At the date of acquisition the cost of these intangibles as a share of the larger acquisition was calculated and subsequently the assets are held at amortised cost.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairments, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows i. e. CGUs.
Financial assets In respect of regular way purchases or sales, the Group uses trade date accounting to recognise or derecognise financial assets.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
106 IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Our Financials Group Notes Financial assets continued The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories listed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
None of the Groups financial assets are categorised as held to maturity or available for sale.
i At fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are either financial assets held for trading or financial assets which are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
This category includes equity investments, debt investments, equity rights, contingent value rights and investments in limited partnerships.
Investments in associated undertakings, which are held by the Group with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, are also categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
This measurement basis is consistent with the fact that the Groups performance in respect of investments in equity investments, limited partnerships and associated undertakings is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an established investment strategy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and any gains or losses arising from subsequent changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income in the period which they arise.
Fair value hierarchy The Group classifies financial assets using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the related fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy, within which a financial asset is classified, is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to that assets fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as prices from market transactions.
These are mainly based on prices determined from recent investments in the last twelve months.
Level 3 One or more inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Equity investments The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices in an active market at the reporting date.
The fair value of unlisted securities is established using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis and earnings multiples.
Wherever possible, the Group uses valuation techniques which make maximum use of market-based inputs.
Accordingly, the valuation methodology used most commonly by the Group is the price of recent investment contained in the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines the IPEVCV Guidelines endorsed by the British & European Venture Capital Associations.
The following considerations are used when calculating the fair value of unlisted securities: Cost Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost may provide a good indication of fair value unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired, such as observable data suggesting a deterioration of the financial, technical, or commercial performance of the underlying business.
Price of recent investment The Group considers that fair value estimates, which are based entirely on observable market data, will be of greater reliability than those based on assumptions and, accordingly, where there has been any recent investment by third parties, the price of that investment will generally provide a basis of the valuation.
The length of period for which it remains appropriate to use the price of recent investment depends on the specific circumstances of the investment and the stability of the external environment.
Accounting Policies continued Given the nature of the Groups investments in seed, start-up and early-stage companies, where there are often no current and no short-term future earnings or positive cash flows, it can be difficult to gauge the probability and financial impact of the success or failure of development or research activities and to make reliable cash flow forecasts.
Consequently, the most appropriate approach to determine fair value is a methodology that is based on market data, that being the price of a recent investment.
Where the Group considers that the price of recent investment, unadjusted, is no longer relevant and there are limited or no comparable companies or transactions from which to infer value, the Group carries out an enhanced assessment based on milestone analysis and or industry and sector analysis.
In applying the milestone analysis approach to investments in companies in early or development stages the Group seeks to determine whether there is an indication of change in fair value based on a consideration of performance against any milestones that were set at the time of the original investment decision, as well as taking into consideration the key market drivers of the investee company and the overall economic environment.
Where the Group considers that there is an indication that the fair value has changed, an estimation is made of the required amount of any adjustment from the last price of recent investment.
Wherever possible, this adjustment is based on objective data from the investee company and the experience and judgement of the Group.
However, any adjustment is, by its very nature, subjective.
Where a deterioration in value has occurred, the Group reduces the carrying value of the investment to reflect the estimated decrease.
If there is evidence of value creation the Group may consider increasing the carrying value of the investment: however, in the absence of additional financing rounds or profit generation it can be difficult to determine the value that a purchaser may place on positive developments given the potential outcome and the costs and risks to achieving that outcome and accordingly caution is applied.
Factors that the Group considers include, inter alia, technical measures such as product development phases and patent approvals, financial measures such as cash burn rate and profitability expectations, and market and sales measures such as testing phases, product launches and market introduction.
Other valuation techniques If there is no readily ascertainable value from following the price of recent investment methodology, or there is objective evidence that a deterioration in fair value has occurred since a relevant transaction, the Group considers alternative methodologies in the IPEVCV Guidelines such as discounted cash flows DCF or price-earnings multiples.
DCF involves estimating the fair value of a business by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows, based on the most recent forecasts in respect of the underlying business.
Given the difficulty of producing reliable cash flow forecasts for seed, start-up and early-stage companies as described earlier, this methodology is generally used as a confirmatory indicator of the level of any adjustment that may need to be made to the last price of recent investment.
When using the earnings multiple methodology, earnings before interest and tax EBIT are generally used, adjusted to a maintainable level.
A suitable earnings multiple is derived from an equivalent business or group of businesses, for which the average price-earnings multiple for the relevant sector index can generally be considered a suitable proxy.
This multiple is applied to earnings to derive an enterprise value which is then discounted by up to 60% for non-marketability and other risks inherent to businesses in early stages of operation.
No reliable estimate Where a fair value cannot be estimated reliably, the investment is reported at the carrying value at the previous reporting date unless there is objective evidence that the investment has since been impaired.
108 IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Our Financials Group Notes Debt investments Debt investments are generally unquoted debt instruments which are convertible to equity at a future point in time.
Such instruments are considered to be hybrid instruments containing a fixed rate debt host contract with an embedded equity derivative.
The Group designates the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition and, accordingly, the embedded derivative is not separated from the host contract and accounted for separately.
The fair value of debt investments is established by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the instrument.
Equity rights The equity rights asset represents consideration paid to the University of Oxford between December 2000 and June 2001 that gave the Group contractual rights to the receipt of shares in unlisted spin-out companies or cash based on research carried out in the universitys Department of Chemistry.
It is considered to be a derivative financial asset and is designated as at fair value through profit and loss.
Its value has been assessed each year with any impairments being charged to the income statement.
The contract expired in November 2015 and consequently the asset has been impaired to nil value.
Contingent value rights In instances where the Group receives contingent financial consideration upon the disposal of a financial asset, the resulting asset shall be recognised and designated as at fair value through profit and loss, and treated accordingly.
ii Loans and receivables These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to customers trade receivables and are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Deposits Deposits comprise longer-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of greater than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and short-term deposits held with financial institutions with an original maturity of three months or less.
Financial liabilities Current financial liabilities are composed of trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are recognised at amortised cost.
Non-current liabilities are composed of loans from Limited Partners of consolidated funds, and outstanding amounts drawn down from a debt facility provided by the European Investment Bank.
The loans from Limited Partners of consolidated funds are repayable only upon the applicable funds generating sufficient returns to repay the Limited Partners.
Management anticipates that the funds will generate the required returns and consequently recognises the full associated liabilities.
Non-current liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Groups financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
Accounting Policies continued Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity if the holders have only a residual interest in the Groups assets after deducting all liabilities.
The objective of the Group is to manage capital so as to provide shareholders with above average returns through capital growth over the medium to long-term.
The Group considers its capital to comprise its share capital, share premium, merger reserve and retained earnings.
Top Technology Ventures Limited, a Group subsidiary, is subject to external capital requirements imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and as such must ensure that it has sufficient capital to satisfy these requirements.
The Group ensures it remains compliant with these requirements as described in the financial statements of Top Technology Ventures Limited.
Employee benefits i Pension obligations The Group operates a company defined contribution pension scheme for which all employees are eligible.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group currently makes contributions on behalf of staff to this scheme or to employee personal pension schemes on an individual basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
ii Share-based payments The Group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from employees, by granting employees conditional awards of ordinary shares subject to certain vesting conditions.
Conditional awards of shares are made pursuant to the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards and or the Groups Annual Incentive Scheme AIS.
The fair value of the shares is estimated at the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, including market-based performance conditions.
The fair value at the date of grant is recognised as an expense over the period that the employee provides services, generally the period between the start of the performance period and the vesting date of the shares.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of services is calculated using the market value on the date of award and is adjusted for expected and actual levels of vesting.
Where conditional awards of shares lapse the expense recognised to date is credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they lapse.
Where the terms for an equity-settled award are modified, and the modification increases the total fair value of the share-based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee at the date of modification, the incremental fair value is amortised over the vesting period.
Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences resulting from the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be recovered in the future.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Financial Risk Management As set out in the Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 34 to 41, the Group is exposed, through its normal operations, to a number of financial risks, the most significant of which are market, liquidity and credit risks.
In general, risk management is carried out throughout the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The following further describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
a Market risk i Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of the equity and debt investments, and investments in Limited Partnerships held by the Group and categorised as at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group mitigates this risk by having established investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The Group has also established corporate finance and communications teams dedicated to supporting portfolio companies with fundraising activities and investor relations.
The Group holds investments which are publicly traded on AIM 20 companies and investments which are not traded on an active market.
The net increase in fair value of the Groups equity and debt investments during 2015 of 86.4m represents a 25% change against the opening balance 2014: net increase of 20.7m, 7% and a similar increase or decrease in the prices of quoted and unquoted investments is considered to be reasonably possible.
The table below summarises the impact of a 1% increase decrease in the price of both quoted and unquoted investments on the Groups post-tax profit for the year and on equity.
2015 2014 Quoted Unquoted Total Quoted Unquoted Total m m m m m m Equity investments and investments in limited partnerships 2.0 3.6 5.6 1.4 2.1 3.5 ii Interest rate risk The EIB debt facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.98% with an additional variable spread equal to the six month GBP Libor rate as at the first date of each six month interest period.
The first 15.0m tranche was disbursed on 17 December 2015 and the total floating interest rate including the fixed element for the remainder of 2015 was 2.48%.
The other primary impact of interest rate risk to the Group is the impact on the income and operating cash flows as a result of the interest-bearing deposits and cash and cash equivalents held by the Group.
iii Concentrations of risk The Group is exposed to concentration risk via the significant majority of the portfolio being UK based companies and thus subject to the performance of the UK economy.
The Group is increasing its operations in the US and the determination of the associated concentrations is determined by the number of investment opportunities that management believe represent a good investment.
com 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Financial Risk Management continued The Group mitigates this risk, in co-ordination with liquidity risk, by managing its proportion of fixed to floating rate financial assets.
The table below summarises the interest rate profile of the Group.
2015 2014 Fixed Floating Interest Fixed Floating Interest rate rate free Total rate rate free Total m m m m m m m m Financial assets Equity rights 1.1 1.1 Equity investments 543.1 543.1 345.9 345.9 Debt investments 0.2 8.9 9.1 0.2 3.8 4.0 Limited and limited liability partnership interests 4.4 4.4 4.6 4.6 Contingent value rights 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 Deposits 70.0 70.0 30.0 30.0 Cash and cash equivalents 108.8 108.8 67.3 67.3 Trade receivables 3.0 3.0 4.8 4.8 Other receivables 0.2 0.2 70.2 108.8 561.0 740.0 30.2 67.3 361.6 459.1 Financial liabilities Trade payables 0.7 0.7 1.5 1.5 Other accruals and deferred income 3.2 3.2 0.6 0.6 Loans from limited partners of consolidated funds 7.1 7.1 4.5 4.5 EIB debt facility 14.9 14.9 14.9 11.0 25.9 6.6 6.6 At 31 December 2015, if interest rates had been 1% higher lower, post-tax profit for the year, and other components of equity, would have been 1.1m 2014: 0.7m higher lower as a result of higher interest received on floating rate cash deposits.
b Liquidity risk The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Groups Treasury Management Policy asserts that at any one point in time no more than 60% of the Groups cash and cash equivalents will be placed in fixed-term deposits with a holding period greater than three months.
Accordingly, the Group only invests working capital in short-term instruments issued by reputable counterparties.
The Group continually monitors rolling cash flow forecasts to ensure sufficient cash is available for anticipated cash requirements.
c Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its deposits, cash and cash equivalents, debt investments and trade receivables.
The Group seeks to mitigate its credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by making short-term deposits with counterparties, or by investing in treasury funds with an AA credit rating or above managed by institutions.
Short-term deposit counterparties are required to have most recently reported total assets in excess of 5bn and, where applicable, a prime short-term credit rating at the time of investment ratings are generally determined by Moodys or Standard & Poors.
Moodys prime credit ratings of P1, P2 and P3 indicate respectively that the rating agency considers the counterparty to have a superior, strong or acceptable ability to repay short-term debt obligations generally defined as having an original maturity not exceeding 13 months.
An analysis of the Groups deposits and cash and cash equivalents balance analysed by credit rating as at the reporting date is shown in the table below.
All other financial assets are unrated.
112 IP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Our Financials Group Notes 2015 2014 Credit rating m m P1 126.3 68.7 P2 52.5 28.6 AA Total deposits and cash and cash equivalents 178.8 97.3 The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group has detailed policies and strategies which seek to minimise these associated risks including defining maximum counterparty exposure limits for term deposits based on their perceived financial strength at the commencement of the deposit.
The maximum single counterparty limit for deposits at 31 December 2015 was 50m 2014: 25m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk on debt investments is managed in a similar way to equity price risk, as described earlier, through the Groups investment appraisal processes and asset monitoring procedures which are subject to overall review by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for debt investments, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements The directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions, which have the most significant effects on the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements, are discussed below.
i Valuation of unquoted equity investments The judgements required, in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unquoted equity investments, have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the future earnings potential of portfolio companies, appropriate earnings multiples to apply, and marketability and other risk discounts.
ii Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined using a number of value-in-use and  calculations.
The use of these methods requires the estimation of future cash flows, and the selection of a suitable discount rate, in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows as well as the selection of applicable and reasonable multiples.
iii Acquired intangible assets At the date of its acquisition by IP Group, Fusion IP had contractual arrangements with four UK universities.
The Group separately recognised each of these contractual arrangements as an intangible asset at its fair value at acquisition date.
As the intangible assets are not quoted on an active market, the fair value at acquisition date was determined by averaging the inflationand venture capital industry activity-adjusted true cost of all university contracts that IP Group was aware of and that have had costs associated with those contracts.
As the contractual agreements are for a finite term, the intangible assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortisation will occur over the remaining term or useful life of each contractual arrangement with each of the four universities.
Discussion of sensitivity analyses is included in the relevant note for each of the above estimates and judgements.
com 24609-04 Proof 9 5 April 2016 8:02 PM Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4.
Revenue from Services All revenue from services is derived from either the provision of advisory and venture capital fund management services or the licensing of internally developed therapeutic compounds.
Operating Segments For both the year ended 31 December 2015 and the year ended 31 December 2014, the Groups revenue and profit loss before taxation were derived almost entirely from its principal activities within the UK.
Though the Group has initiated operations in the US, the associated revenues and costs are currently immaterial and accordingly, no additional geographical disclosures are given.
For management reporting purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating segments: i the commercialisation of intellectual property via the formation of long-term partner relationships with universities: ii the management of venture funds focusing on early-stage UK technology companies: and iii the in-licensing of drugable intellectual property from research intensive institutions.
These activities are described in further detail in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 45.

Goodwill m At 1 January 2014 18.4 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiary 37.1 At 1 January 2015 57.1 At 31 December 2015 57.1 The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The goodwill allocated to each CGU is summarised in the table below.
A number of both value-in-use and  calculations are used to assess the recoverable values of the CGUs, details of which are specified below.

Impairment review of the university partnership CGU The key assumptions of the DCF models used to assess the value in use are shown below.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the university partnership CGU comprises those elements connected with the Groups university partnership business other than those that specifically arose as a result of the Groups now expired contract with the University of Oxfords Department of Chemistry which were used in the valuation of that asset prior to its expiry.
The Directors consider that for each of the key variables which would be relevant in determining a recoverable value for the university partnership CGU, there is a range of reasonably possible alternative values.
The key variable ranges are set out below: 2015 2014 m m Number of spin-out companies per year 1015 1015 Annual investment rate 40m60m 40m60m Rate of return achieved 18%22% 18%22% Initial equity stake acquired by the Group under the university partnership 15%35% 15%35% Proportion of spin-out companies failing 32%45% 32%45% Weighted average holding period years 35 35 Dilution rates prior to exit as a result of financing for spin-out companies 40%60% 40%60% Proportion of IPO exits 25%35% 25%35% IPO exit valuations 30m40m 30m40m Proportion of disposal exits 28%32% 28%32% Disposal valuations 25m35m 25m35m Discount rate 9%11% 9%11% When determining the key variables, management has, where possible and appropriate, used historical performance data as a basis.
In instances where the forecasted volumes and scale of activity do not align with the Groups prior performance, management applies its judgement in determining said variables.
A number of different value-in-use models were assessed in order to evaluate the recoverable value of the CGU, none of which resulted in an impairment being required.

Investment Portfolio continued Fair values of unquoted spin-out companies classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy have been determined, in part or in full, by valuation techniques that are not supported by observable market prices or rates.
Investments in 21 companies have been classified as Level 3 and the individual valuations for each of these have been arrived at using a variety of valuation techniques and assumptions.
Where fair values are based upon the most recent market transaction, but that transaction occurred more than twelve months prior to the balance sheet date, the investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of investments categorised as Level 3 are analysed on a monthly basis to determine business factors which may make the most recent investment rate no longer a representation of fair value.
There are no identified unobservable inputs to which the Level 3 fair values would be materially sensitive.
This is represented by the fact that if the fair value of all Level 3 investments were to decrease by 10%, the net assets figure would decrease by 3.3m, with a corresponding increase if the unobservable inputs were to increase by 10%.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Transfers between tiers are then made as if the transfer took place on the first day of the period in question, except in the cases of transfers between tiers based on an initial public offering IPO of an investment wherein the changes in value prior to the IPO are calculated and reported in tier 2, and those changes post are attributed to tier 1.
If the assumptions used in the valuation techniques for the Groups holding in each company are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the carrying value of the respective spin-out company.
The effect on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period is also not expected to be material.
Transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 occur when a previously unquoted investment undertakes an initial public offering, resulting in its equity becoming quoted on an active market.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 35.0m.
Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 would occur when a quoted investments market becomes inactive, or the portfolio company elects to delist.
There has been one such instance in the current period which amounted to 0.1m.
Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 occur when an investment which previously had a most recent investment of over twelve months ago undertakes an investment, resulting in an observable market rate.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 2.1 m. Transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 occur when an investments recent investment becomes more than twelve months old, with the price being deemed unobservable.
In the current period, transfers of this nature amounted to 28.4m.
Fair value changes in Level 3 investments have been a loss of 7.3m in the period, recognised as change in fair value of equity and debt investments in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Contingent Value Rights As a result of the disposal of Proximagen Group plc in August 2012, the Group received contingent consideration, in the form of contingent value rights CVRs, based upon future net revenues of two associated drug programmes.
In line with the Groups policies, these have been recognised as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, and have been fair valued at 1.4m 2014: 1.4m.
The Group considers this asset to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy throughout the current and previous financial years.
If the assumptions used in the valuation techniques are varied by using a range of possible alternatives, there is no material difference to the statement of financial position nor the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Borrowings continued EIB debt facility On 8 July 2015 the Group secured a 30m, 8-year debt facility from the European Investment Bank.
The facility is to be disbursed in two tranches, with the first tranche of 15m being drawn down during the period 14.9m net of expenses.
The Group will use the proceeds to continue to fund UK university spin-out companies as they develop and mature.
A non-utilisation fee of 0.15% is charged over the undrawn element of the facility.
In 2015, due to the timings of the arrangement of the facility, the non-utilisation fee charged was nil.
The first tranche of 15.0m was drawn down on 16 December 2015.
There was 0.1m of initial transaction costs incurred in the arrangement of the facility.
This balance was set against the loan amount and is to be subsequently amortised over the term of the loan.
The associated charge to the statement of comprehensive income for 2015 was nil.
The capital is repayable in ten equal payments over a five year period with the first payment due on 7 January 2019.
The drawn down element of the facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.98% with an additional variable spread equal to the six month GBP Libor rate as at the first date of each six month interest period.
The interest charged on the first tranche in 2015 amounted to nil.
The Group must ensure that the ratio between the value of the portfolio along with the value of the Groups cash net of any outstanding liabilities, and the outstanding debt facility does not fall below 6:1.
The Group must maintain that the amount of unencumbered funds freely available to the Group is not less than 15.0m.
The Group is also required to maintain a separate bank account which must at any date maintain a minimum balance equal to that of all payments due to the EIB in the forthcoming six months.

Leases are negotiated for an average term of five years and rentals are fixed for an average of one year.
Share-Based Payments In 2015, the Group continued to incentivise employees through its LTIP and AIS.
Both are described in more detail in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 86.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP Awards made to employees under the Groups AIS above a certain threshold include 50% deferred into IP Group equity through the grant of nil-cost options under the Groups DBSP.
The number of nil-cost options granted under the Groups DBSP is determined by the share price at vesting date.
The DBSP options are subject to further time-based vesting over two years typically 50% after year one and 50% after year two.
An analysis of movements in the DBSP options outstanding is as follows: 2015 2014 At 1 January 362,608 Awarded as a result of deferral of previous years AIS award during the year 362,608 Exercised during the year 174,739 Lapsed during the year At 31 December 187,869 362,608 As the 2015 AIS financial performance targets were met and as the number of DBSP options to be granted in order to defer such elements of the AIS payments as are required under our remuneration policy are based on a percentage of employees salary, the share-based payments line includes the associated share based payments expense incurred in 2015.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards under the LTIP take the form of conditional awards of ordinary shares of 2p each in the Group which vest over the prescribed performance period to the extent that performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee imposes objective conditions on the vesting of awards and these take into consideration the guidance of the Groups institutional investors from time to time.
Further information on the Groups LTIP is set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 86.

Share-Based Payments continued The 2015 LTIP awards were made on 21 May 2015.
The awards will ordinarily vest on 31 March 2018, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The awards are based on the performance of the Groups Hard NAV and Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Both performance measures are combined into a matrix format to most appropriately measure performance relative to the business, as shown in the Directors Remuneration Report within the Groups 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
The total award is subject to an underpin based on the relative performance of the Groups TSR to that of the FTSE 250 index, which can reduce the awards by up to 50%.
The 2015 LTIP matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2018, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.
Further, the matrix is designed such that 30% of the award shall vest again prior to the application of the underpin if the cumulative increase is 8% per annum for both measures over their respective performance periods threshold performance.
A straight-line sliding scale is applied for performance between the distinct points on the matrix of vesting targets.
The 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards were both made in 2014.
The awards will respectively ordinarily vest on 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
The 2014 LTIP matrix is designed such that up to 100% of the award prior to the application of the underpin will vest in full in the event of both Hard NAV increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 2013 LTIP: 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015, and TSR increasing by 15% per year on a cumulative basis from the date of award to 31 March 2017 2013 LTIP: to 31 March 2016, using an industry-standard average price period at the beginning and end of the performance period.

Capital Management The Groups key objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of issued new shares or dispose of interests in more mature portfolio companies.
During 2015, the Groups strategy, which was unchanged from 2014, was to maintain healthy cash and shortterm deposit balances that enable it to provide capital to all portfolio companies, as determined by the Groups investment committee, whilst having sufficient cash reserves to meet all working capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
The Group has an external debt facility with associated covenants that are described in Note 18.

Further, the Groups automatic entitlement to share in any of the University of Yorks proceeds from out-licensing has been removed from the agreement.
iv The Group extended its partnership with the University of Leeds in July 2005 by securing the right with associated contractual commitment to invest up to 5.0m in University of Leeds spin-out companies.

Under the terms of the variation agreement, subject to quality and quantity of the investment opportunities, the Group, Techtran Group Limited and the University of Leeds have agreed to target annual investments of at least 0.7m in aggregate and, subject to earlier termination or the parties otherwise agreeing alternative target, to review this target on 30 April 2017.

viii In September 2006, the Group entered into an agreement with the University of Bath to invest in University of Bath spin-out companies.
The Group has committed to invest up to a total of 5.0m in University of Bath spin-out companies.
