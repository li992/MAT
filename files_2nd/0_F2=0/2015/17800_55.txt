The reclassification of $9.4 million is related to the acquisition of Duluth Metals Limited Duluth.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group held 17.2% of Duluths share capital, with a fair value of $9.4 million, accounted for as an available-for-sale investment.
As explained in Note 19, in January 2015 the Group completed its acquisition of 100% of Duluth.
Duluth held a 60% stake in Twin Metals Minnesota Limited Twin Metals, a company in which the Group held a 40% stake as at December 2014.
Accordingly, as a consequence of the acquisition of Duluth the Group had a 100% interest in Duluth and, as a result of this, a 100% interest in Twin Metals.
The principal asset of Twin Metals is its copper-nickel-PGM deposit in north-eastern Minnesota, and the transaction has accordingly been accounted for as the acquisition by the Group of the remaining 60% interest in that asset, with this $9.4 million balance forming part of the total consideration of that acquisition.
From January 2015, Twin Metals has therefore been consolidated as a 100% subsidiary of the Group, with this $9.4 million balance forming part of the total consideration reflected in the accounting for the acquisition of the subsidiary.
19 Duluth Metals Limited transaction In January 2015, the Group completed its acquisition of 100% of Duluth Metals Limited Duluth.
The principal asset of Duluth was its 60% stake in Twin Metals Minnesota Limited Twin Metals, a company in which the Group held the remaining 40% stake as at December 2014.
The principal asset of Twin Metals is its copper-nickel-PGM deposit in north-eastern Minnesota, and the transaction has accordingly been accounted for as the acquisition by the Group of the remaining 60% interest in that asset.
Immediately prior to the completion of the transaction the Group held 17.2% of Duluths share capital.
The fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire the remaining 82.8% of the share capital of Duluth in January 2015 was $44.3 million, reflecting the agreed acquisition price of C$0.45 per share.
In addition, transaction costs of $6.3 million have been included as part of the cost of the asset acquisition.
The carrying value of the Groups existing investment in associate balance relating to its 40% interest in Twin Metals at the date of the transaction in January 2015 was $67.4 million, and the carrying value of the Groups existing available-for-sale investment balance relating to its 17.2% holding of Duluths share capital at that date was $9.4 million.
As part of the acquisition agreement the Group also agreed to redeem convertible debentures previously issued by Duluth at a cash cost of $31.7 million, and has also acquired the other sundry net liabilities of Duluth.
This has resulted in the Group consolidating 100% of the assets and liabilities relating to Twin Metals with effect from January 2015.
The principal assets recognised at that date were an intangible asset balance of $150.1 million reflecting the value of the mining property assets, and a property, plant and equipment balance of $20.8 million relating to land and buildings.
In addition, a liability of $31.7 million was recognised in respect of the Duluth convertible debentures, which were subsequently redeemed by the Group, along with $11.8 million of other sundry net liabilities of Duluth and Twin Metals.
20 Compaia Minera Zaldvar SpA transaction On 1 December 2015, Antofagasta completed its acquisition of a 50% stake in Compaia Minera Zaldvar SpA Zaldvar from Barrick Gold Corporation Barrick, pursuant to an agreement entered into on 30 July 2015.
As a result, Antofagasta has become operator of the Zaldvar mine.
Zaldvar is an open-pit, heap-leach copper mine located in northern Chile, which produces approximately 100,000 tonnes of copper cathodes annually.
Given that Antofagasta and Barrick have joint control over Zaldvar, Antofagasta is accounting for its 50% stake in Zaldvar as a joint venture.
Total consideration for the transaction was $1,005 million, subject to adjustments based on the net debt and working capital levels of Zaldvar at the completion date.
The consideration was wholly in cash, with $980 million payable upon closing subject to the net debt and working capital adjustments, and five annual payments of $5 million per year, starting in 2016.
Provisional estimated adjustments in respect of the net debt and working capital levels of Zaldvar at 1 December 2015 resulted in a provisional reduction in the consideration of $10.3 million to $994.7 million.
Including capitalised acquisition costs of $7.0 million the initial investment in joint venture balance is therefore $1,001.7 million.
It is currently expected that the net debt and working capital adjustments will be finalised during the first half of 2016, allowing a final determination of the total consideration and the fair value of the share of assets and liabilities acquired.
