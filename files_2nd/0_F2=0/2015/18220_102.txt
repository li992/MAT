Retirement benefit liabilities The table below summarises the Groups net year end post-employment liabilities and activity for the year 2015 2014 m m Balance sheet obligations for: Defined pension benefits 62.8 1108 Post-employment medical benefits 16.0 159 78.8 1267 Income statement charge included in profit before tax for: Defined pension benefits 18.2 175 Post-employment medical benefits 1.1 08 19.3 183 Remeasurements included in other comprehensive income expense for: Defined pension benefits 32.1 126 Post-employment medical benefits 1.5 31 33.6 157 Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, US and several other territories under broadly similar regulatory frameworks The Groups main schemes are of the final salary pension type, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in thefinal years leading up to retirement In the UK plans, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index, whereas in the US plans, pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment With the exception of this inflationary risk in the UK, the plans face broadly similar risks, as described on page 107 The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds: however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where therelevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between theGroup and the trustees or equivalent and their composition Responsibility for governance of the schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies jointly with the relevant Group company and the particular schemes board of trustees Theboard of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each schemes regulations During 2015 we consulted our UK scheme members on proposed changes to the scheme, following which, the scheme will change froma final salary scheme to a career average revalued earnings CARE defined benefit scheme, annual pensionable earnings willbecapped at 65,000 and indexation of pensions in payment will be based on CPI, rather than RPI, for service accrued from April2016 This is expected toreduce the future cost and risk attached to the scheme The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of these schemes are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Present value of funded obligations UK pension scheme 784.1 8116 US pension scheme 112.2 1099 Rest of World 131.1 1310 1,027.4 1,0525 Fair value of schemes assets UK pension scheme 767.1 7402 US pension scheme 94.2 958 Rest of World 108.3 1105 969.6 9465 Net liability in respect of funded schemes 57.8 1060 Present value of unfunded obligations 5.0 48 Liability in Group balance sheet excluding post-employment medical benefits 62.8 1108 Croda International Plc 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements 2015 2014 m m Movement in present value of retirement benefit obligations in the year: Opening balance 1,057.3 9326 Current service cost 15.6 136 Settlements 97 Interest cost 35.8 392 Remeasurements Change in demographic assumptions 15.8 55 Change in financial assumptions 31.9 1098 Experience losses gains 3.0 10 Contributions paid in Employee 2.7 27 Benefits paid 34.7 340 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 0.4 14 1,032.4 1,0573 Movement in fair value of schemes assets in the year: Opening balance 946.5 8083 Interest income 33.1 353 Remeasurements Return on scheme assets, excluding amounts included in financial expenses 12.6 1015 Contributions paid in Employee 2.7 27 Employer 34.7 427 Benefits paid out including settlements 34.7 426 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 0.1 14 969.6 9465 As at the balance sheet date, the present value of retirement benefit obligations was comprised of approximately 287m in respect of active employees, 282m in respect of deferred members and 463m in relation to members in retirement Total employer contributions to the schemes in 2016 are expected to be 144m The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 UK US UK US Discount rate 3.8% 4.3% 36% 40% Inflation rate 3.1% 2.5% 32% 25% Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% 4.0% 42% 40% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.9% n a 30% n a Duration of liabilities ie life expectancy years 18.5 11.7 201 120 Remaining working life 15.8 11.2 153 112 Croda International Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 105 Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Accounts 11.
Retirement benefit liabilities continued The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions is as follows: Impact on retirement benefit obligation Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease Discount rate 0.5% -84% 96% Inflation rate 0.5% 61% -55% Mortality assume all scheme members one year younger 1 year 30% n a The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant In practice, thisisunlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated withthe projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 182 years The assets in

pension schemes set out above with theaddition of actuarial assumptions relating to the long term increase in health care costs of 84% a year 2014: 73% The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in

volatility Through its defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, themost significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, a deficit will be created Both the UK and US plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term Whilst our Dutch scheme is less mature, regulatory pressures result inlower equity holdings As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities However, the Group and the pension trustees Trustees believe that due to the long termnature of thescheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element oftheGroups long term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently See below for more details on the Groups asset-liability matchingstrategy Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value oftheschemes bond holdings Inflation risk Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities However, the level ofinflationary increases are usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase ininflation will thus increase thedeficit In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less materialrisk Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result inan increase in the schemes liabilities This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity tochanges in life expectancy In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching ALM framework that has been developed to achieve long term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes Within this framework, the Groups ALM objective is to match a portion ofassets to the pension obligations by investing in long term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments asthey fall due and in the appropriate currency The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield ofthe investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations The Group has not changed theprocesses used to manage its risks from previous periods Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level ofassets Alarge portion of assets in 2015 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash andinfrastructure funds The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk BoththeUK and Dutch schemes make use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk The triennial valuation of the UK scheme was completed as at 30 September 2014 The results showed that the actuarial scheme deficithad been eliminated following the last deficit payment of 22m in January 2015 As a result, no deficit funding payments to thisscheme will be required prior to the next triennial valuation due as at September 2017 The funding review of our US scheme isundertaken annually As at 31 December 2014 the scheme was 1206% funded, with the funding level allowing for contributions received during 2015 The Groups Dutch scheme, as alluded to earlier, is subject to a more rigorous regulatory environment under thesupervision of the Dutch National Bank DNB As at 31 December 2015 the scheme was 1126% funded on an actuarial basis relative to the DNBs required level of 1236% and a minimum funding requirement of 1052% Croda International Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 107
