10.2 Defined benefit plan The Group operates two defined benefit plans.
The Pension Plan of Savills the UK Plan is a UK-based plan which provided final salary pension benefits to some employees, but was closed with regard to future service-based benefit accrual with effect from 31 March 2010.
From 1 April 2010, pension benefits for former employees of the UK Plan are provided through the Groups defined contribution Personal Pension Plan.
As part of the acquisition of Savills Fund Management GMBH a further plan was acquired the SFM Plan which provides final salary benefits to 28 active employees and 91 former employees.
The plan is closed to future service-based benefit accrual.
The UK Plan is administered by a separate Trust that is legally separated from the Company.
The board of the pension fund is composed of six trustees.
The board of the pension fund is required by law and by its Article of Association to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The board of the pension fund is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2013 and has been updated to 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.

These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for apensioner retiring at age 60: SFM Plan UK Plan 2015 2014 2015 2014 Retiring at the end of the reporting year Male 83.6 88.8 88.7 Female 88.1 90.3 90.2 Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year Male 86.4 90.7 90.6 Female 90.7 92.3 92.2 The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is: SFM Plan UK Plan Impact on present value Impact on present value of scheme benefit of scheme obligations m m 0.1% increase in discount rates 0.2 4.9 0.1% increase in inflation rate 0.1 2.5 0.1% increase in salary increase rate 0.8 1 year increase in life expectancy 0.4 6.5 SAVILLS PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 103 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 December 2015 continued The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: SFM Plan UK Plan 2015 2014 2015 2014 m % m % m % m % Equity instruments 3.7 31% 76.3 37% 75.6 37% Diversified growth funds 62.9 30% 59.7 29% Gilts 11.2 5% 11.8 6% Bonds 58.8 28% 58.8 28% Cash and cash equivalents 8.5 69% 0.7 0.6 Total 12.2 100% 209.9 100% 206.5 100% No plan assets are the Groups own financial instruments or property occupied or used by the Group.
The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets.
Although the UK Plan does not invest directly in the Groups financial instruments, it does invest in passive equity funds, so will have some exposure to FTSE All Share, hence indirectly to the Savills share price.
Through the defined benefit plan, the Group is exposed to anumber of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: a Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using adiscount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create adeficit.
The Plan holds asignificant proportion of equities and diversified growth funds, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
b Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans bond holdings.
c Inflation risk Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or are loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
d Life expectancy The majority of the Plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans liabilities.
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2016 are 6.0m.
The Company expects to contribute 0.3m.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 23 years for the UK Plan and 17 years for the SFM Plan.
