Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Interests in structured entities continued c Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Group receives management fees and other fees in respect of its asset management businesses.
The Group does not sponsor any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees.
Management fees received for investments that the Group manages but does not have a holding in also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities.
As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Groups maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees.
The table below shows the assets under management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those entities.
The reduction in total assets under management is primarily the result of a reduction in total pension fund assets managed by Poland.
