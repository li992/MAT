Authorisation of financial statements The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 1 March 2016 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Mark Dixon and Dominik fide Daniel.
Regus plc S. A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Luxembourg.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Regus plc S. A. owns a network of business centres which are leased to a variety of business customers.
Information on the Groups structure is provided in note 32, and information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in note 31.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs.
The Company prepares its parent company annual accounts in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP: extracts from these are presented on page 100.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in the associate and jointly controlled entities.
The extract from the parent company annual accounts presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC with an effective date from 1 January 2015 did not have a material effect on the Group financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to standards were adopted by the Group for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015: IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments to IAS 19 IAS 40 Investment Property Amendments to IAS 40 IFRS 3 Business Combinations Contingent consideration arrangements IFRS 3 Business Combinations Joint arrangements IFRS 8 Operating Segments Amendments to IFRS 8 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Amendments to IFRS 13 Various Annual Improvements 2010 2012 Cycle Various Annual Improvements 2011 2013 Cycle Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 33.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as described in note 24.
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements on pages 56 to 99.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have considered the further information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 13 to 15 as well as the Groups principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 21 to 24.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 24 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 81.
These Group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is Regus plcs functional currency, and all values are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases or the associate qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.

Accounting policies continued When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of a joint venture.
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group.
As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date.
The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value.
The effect of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve.
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc.
At the date of the transaction, Regus plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus Group plc.
Consequently, no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.
IFRSs not yet effective The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements as they are effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015 or have not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
Except for IFRS16 Leases, their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements: IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative Amendment to IAS 1 1 January 2016 IAS 16 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016 IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016 IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of interests in Joint operations Amendments to IFRS 11 1 January 2016 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle 1 January 2016 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which were available for optional early adoption and relevant to the Group.
The Group will adopt the above standards or amendments in the year in which they become effective and or endorsed by the European Union, whichever is later.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences.
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group, at which point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Impairment of non-financial assets For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount was estimated at 31 October 2015.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of these assets to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any indicator is identified then the assets recoverable amount is re-evaluated.
The carrying amount of the Groups other non-financial assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at the balance sheet date to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The Group has identified individual business centres as the CGU.
We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at the centre CGU level where there are indicators of impairment.
Centres CGUs are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest level at which it can be assessed.
Individual fittings and equipment in our centres or elsewhere in the business that become obsolete or are damaged are assessed and impaired where appropriate.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable 62 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 62 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Business combinations that took place prior to the Groups transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under the requirements of IFRS.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Brand Regus brand Indefinite life Brand Other acquired brands 20 years Computer software Up to 5 years Customer lists 2 years Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result.
Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value of the identified assets and its fair value less cost to sell.
Leases Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
All other leases, including all of the Groups property leases, are categorised as operating leases.
Finance leases Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Future payments under finance leases are included in creditors, net of any future finance charges.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating leases Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives, including partner contributions and rent-free periods are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments.
The commencement of the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre turnover or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments.
Contingent rentals are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at an appropriate pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Partner contributions Partner contributions are contributions from our business partners property owners and landlords towards the initial costs of opening a business centre, including the fit-out of the property and the losses that we incur early in the centre life.
The partner contribution is treated as a lease incentive and is amortised over the period of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: Buildings 50 years Leasehold improvements 10 years Furniture 10 years Office equipment and telephones 5 years Computer hardware 3 5 years www.

Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable excluding sales taxes.
Where rent-free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the customer contract.
Workstations Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered.
Amounts invoiced in advance are accounted for as deferred income and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income Service income including the rental of meeting rooms is recognised as services are rendered.
In circumstances where Regus acts as an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered.
Fees charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.
Membership card income Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership card are expected to be provided.
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned from the provision of global workplace solutions.
Employee benefits The Groups major pension plans are of the defined contribution type.
For these plans the Groups contribution and other paid and unpaid benefits earned by the employees are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets, excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income OCI in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Service costs are recognised in profit or loss, and include current and past service costs as well as gains and losses on curtailments.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under cost of sales, selling, general and administration expenses and research and development expenses in the consolidated income statement: service costs comprising current service costs: past service costs: and gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements.
Settlements of defined benefit schemes are recognised in the period in which the settlement occurs.
Share-based payments The share option programme entitles certain employees and Directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company: these awards are granted by the ultimate parent.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights CIP are also granted by the Company to certain employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is initially recognised at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
Taxation Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount 64 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 64 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
Net finance expenses Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a prepayment and recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
In the event of a facility being drawn the relevant unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the carrying value of the financial liability and charged to the interest expense using the effective interest rate method.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Costs arising on bank guarantees and letters of credit and foreign exchange gains or losses are included in other finance costs note 8.
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate method.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading or is designated as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified either at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined on initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on debt instruments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the fair value reserve.
When these assets are derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when recognition would be immaterial.
Customer deposits Deposits received from customers against non-performance of the contract are held on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are returned to the customer at the end of their relationship with the Group.
Foreign currency transactions and foreign operations Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The results and cash flows of foreign operations are translated using the average rate for the period.
Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of foreign operations are translated using the closing rate, with all exchange differences arising on consolidation being recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.
Exchange differences are released to the income statement on disposal.

Accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can be found in note 24.
Derivative financial instruments are measured initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss unless the derivative financial instrument has been designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.
Segmental analysis statutory basis An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including those that relate to transactions with other operating segments.
An operating segments results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker the Board of Directors of the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas: Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA : Asia Pacific: and the United Kingdom.
These geographical segments exclude the Groups non-trading, holding and corporate management companies.
The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief operating decision maker.
All reportable segments are involved in the provision of global workplace solutions.
The Groups reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic characteristics that exist in each of those markets.
Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible for the performance of the segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for Regus plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit, which excludes internal revenue, corporate overheads and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions with other operating segments.
Revenue from internal customers is determined by reference to current market prices.
Segmental analysis entity-wide disclosures The Groups primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions, therefore all revenue is attributed to a single group of similar products and services.
It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of products.
Revenue is recognised where the service is provided.
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups revenue from external customers and non-current assets analysed by foreign country is as follows: 2015 2014 External Non-current External Non-current a a m revenue assets revenue assets Country of domicile Luxembourg 6.2 2.5 4.9 1.5 United States of America 636.3 720.5 524.9 575.6 United Kingdom 391.1 282.2 386.1 275.7 All other countries 893.4 646.4 760.2 465.9 1,927.0 1,651.6 1,676.1 1,318.7 a Excluding deferred tax assets.

Deferred tax assets recognised on short-term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and share-based payments.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are forecast taxable profits in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 189.9m 2014: 249.8m.
The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.

The remaining 24.6% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 40 countries.
The goodwill and indefinite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK are set out below: Intangible Goodwill assets 2015 2014 m m m m USA 240.0 240.0 193.3 UK 221.7 11.2 232.9 191.5 Other countries 150.5 150.5 123.6 612.2 11.2 623.4 508.4 The indefinite life intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 31 December 2006 see note 13.
The value in use for each country has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each country from the value in use of the Group as a whole.
Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group.
Management believes that the projected cash flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term.
In the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each country: Future cash flows are based on the budget for 2016 approved by the Board.
The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use.
Thereafter forecasts have been prepared by management for a further four years from 2016 that reflect an average annual growth rate of 3% 2015: 3%.
These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods.
Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position.
Cash flows beyond 2019 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant countries operate.
A terminal value is included in the assessment, reflecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses.
The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each country.
The country specific discount rate is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital WACC for the Group.
The Group WACC is then adjusted for each country to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country.
The Group pre-tax WACC increased marginally from 12.4% in 2014 to 12.7% in 2015 post-tax WACC: 10.2%.
The country specific pre-tax WACC reflecting the respective market risk adjustment has been set between 12.1% and 17.3% 2014: 11.3% to 17.2%.
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amounts of goodwill are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the countries.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the goodwill carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount.
The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are based on the related business centre structure at the end of the year.
These models therefore do not reflect the expected improvement in margin as new centres mature.
The key assumptions used in the US model forecasts a centre contribution of 26%, with an average centre contribution of 26% over the next five years.
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2015, maintaining a terminal 2020 centre gross margin of 26%.
Thereafter a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 16% 2014: 15%.
The UK model forecasts a 2015 centre contribution of 21%, with an average centre contribution of 21% over the next five years.
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2015, maintaining a terminal 2020 centre gross margin of 21%.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13% 2014: 13%.

Goodwill continued Management has considered the following sensitivities: Market growth and WIPOW Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW.
The value in use calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK would still be greater than their carrying value.
Discount rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation.
The value-in-use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have to be increased to 30% 2014: 23% for the US and 36% 2014: 35% for the UK.

The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 12.
The remaining amortisation life for non-indefinite life brands is nine years.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for policy on a day-to-day basis.
The Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate, and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
Going concern The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27 of the Annual Report and Accounts sets out the Groups strategy and the factors that are likely to affect the future performance and position of the business.
The financial review on pages 18 to 20 within the Strategic Report reviews the trading performance, financial position, and cash flows of the Group.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group made a significant investment in growth and the Groups net debt position increased by 52.6m to a net debt position of 190.6 as at 31 December 2015.
The investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Groups mature business centres and debt.
The Group has a 320m revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship banks with a final maturity in 2020.
As at 31 December 2015 205.1m was available and undrawn.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversified customer base, requirement for customer deposits, and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.
2015 2014 m m Americas 41.2 28.0 EMEA 68.9 57.9 Asia Pacific 33.7 28.7 UK 62.4 46.3 206.2 160.9 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and associated services and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.

Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m Not overdue 158.4 120.4 Past due 0 30 days 31.2 25.8 Past due 31 60 days 7.4 7.9 More than 60 days 20.8 11.6 15.1 8.3 217.8 11.6 169.2 8.3 At 31 December 2015, the Group maintained a provision of 11.6m against potential bad debts 2014: 8.3m arising from trade receivables.
The Group had provided 6.5m 2014: 4.5m in the year and utilised 3.2m 2014: 2.5m.
Customer deposits of 331.6m 2014: 290.4m are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by closely monitoring the global cash position, the available and undrawn credit facilities, and forecast capital expenditure and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group has free cash and liquid investments excluding blocked cash of 47.9m 2014: 55.2m.
In addition to cash and liquid investments, the Group had 205.1m available and undrawn under its committed borrowings.
The Directors consider the Group has adequate liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements.
In May 2014 the Group issued debt securities for a total amount of EUR 210.0m 154.2m using the German Schuldschein framework for debt issuance.
These securities consisted of EUR 165.0m of three year notes and EUR 45.0m of five year notes, and were sold to a number of banks and institutional investors.
The Group maintains a 320m revolving credit facility with a final maturity date in September 2020.
As at 31 December 205.1m was available and undrawn under this facility.
Although the Group has net current liabilities of 446.1m 2014: 303.9m, the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk.
A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be recognised in future periods through the income statement.
Although the Group holds customer deposits of 331.6m 2014: 290.4m these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material.
Therefore the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current liabilities, excluding deferred income, were 205.4m at 31 December 2015 2014: 98.6m.
Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the market value of our investments in financial assets.
These exposures are actively managed by the Group treasury department in accordance with a written policy approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt.
The surplus cash balances are invested short-term, and at the end of 2015 no cash was invested for a period exceeding three months.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The majority of day-to-day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency and the underlying foreign exchange exposure is small.
Transactional exposures do arise in some countries where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency of the affiliate.
Intercompany charging, funding, and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures.
It is the policy of the Group to seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency assets and liabilities, thereby minimising the potential volatility in the income statement.
Net investments in Regus affiliates with a functional currency other than sterling are of a long-term nature and the Group does not normally hedge such foreign currency translation exposures.
From time to time the Group uses short-term derivative financial instruments to manage its transactional foreign exchange exposures where these exposures cannot be eliminated through balancing the underlying risks.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
82 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 82 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The foreign currency exposure arising from open third party transactions held in a currency other than the functional currency of the related entity is summarised as follows: 2015 m GBP JPY EUR USD Trade and other receivables 9.1 16.4 Trade and other payables 1.4 1.2 21.9 19.4 Net statement of financial position exposure 1.4 1.2 12.8 3.0 2014 m GBP JPY EUR USD Trade and other receivables 0.1 5.7 11.4 Trade and other payables 0.9 2.2 26.9 12.9 Net statement of financial position exposure 0.8 2.2 21.2 1.5 Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis For the year ending 31 December 2015 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.7m 2014: decrease of 0.9m with a corresponding increase in total equity.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 6.0m for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: 3.1m.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.8m for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: decrease of 0.1m.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 10.7m for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: 11.7m.
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against sterling would have decreased the Groups total equity by approximately 5.9m for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: 6.4m.
Capital management The Groups parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.

The Company declared an interim dividend of 1.4p per share 2014: 1.25p during the year ended 31 December 2015 and proposed a final dividend of 3.1p per share 2014: 2.75p per share, a 13% increase on the 2014 dividend.
The Groups objective when managing capital equity and borrowings is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group has a net debt position of 190.6m at the end of 2015 2014: 138.0m and 205.1m 2014: 256.6m of committed undrawn borrowings.

Valuation techniques When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 fair values, finance leases and methods used for financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value: Type Valuation technique Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other For cash and cash equivalents, receivables payables with a remaining life of less receivables payables and customer deposits than one year and customer deposits, the book value approximates the fair value because of their short-term nature.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates the carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps The fair values are based on a combination of broker quotes, forward pricing and swap models.
There was no significant unobservable input used in our valuation techniques.

These securities consisted of 165.0m of three year notes and 45.0m of five year notes, and were sold to a number of banks and institutional investors.
These securities are subject to covenants which are similar to our banking facilities.
The Group is in compliance with these covenant requirements.
The underlying interest obligation on these debt securities is floating rate and in euro, however, as part of the Groups balance sheet management and to protect against a future increase in interest rates, 165.0 million was swapped into a fixed rate GBP liability and 45.0m was swapped into a fixed rate euro liability.
While providing the Group with protection against higher interest rates, given the current positive yield curve, the immediate impact of this hedging is a modest increase in financing expense.
The Group maintains a 320.0m revolving credit facility and a 75.0m bank guarantee and letter of credit facility both with final maturities in April 2020 and September 2017 respectively.
Both facilities are subject to financial covenants relating to operating cash flow, net debt to EBITDA, and EBITDA plus rent to interest plus rent.
The Group is in compliance with all covenant requirements.
Share-based payments There are three share-based payment plans, details of which are outlined below: Plan 1: Regus Group Share Option Plan During 2004 the Group established the Regus Group Share Option Plan that entitles Executive Directors and certain employees to purchase shares in Regus plc previously Regus Group plc.

b The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the date of the award.
A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards was updated in the year ended 31 December 2010. www.

Share-based payment continued It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run-rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments may be considered for the 2008 and 2009 grants: In a fast-growing company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
Thus it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly, those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth, will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
It is expected that in the relevant periods the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised, thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens, reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
The performance conditions are as follows: 2008 and 2009 CIP Investment and matching grants The Remuneration Committee agreed to the following modifications to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following performance conditions would apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010.
The total number of matching awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and was subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively.
Thus, conditional on meeting the performance targets, the first amount vested in March 2013, the second vested in March 2014 and the third vested in March 2015.
These vesting dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively.
The vesting of these awards was subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets.

Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
98 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 98 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Valuation of intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill based on our CGUs aggregated at a country level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2015, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions can be found in note 12.
Impairment of property plant and equipment We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at a centre CGU level where there are indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
In the assessment of value-in-use, key judgemental areas in determining future cash flow projections include: an assessment of the location of the centre: the local economic situation: competition: local environmental factors: the management of the centre: and future changes in occupancy, revenue and costs of the centre.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate, the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
Onerous lease provisions We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate.
Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur and can be reliably estimated.
