This normally ranges from one to five months after shipment to the customer.
The provisional pricing mechanism within the sale agreements is an embedded derivative under IFRS.
Gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open sales are recognised through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and to trade debtors in the balance sheet.
The Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market in the market price references for that commodity inthe majority of the Groups contracts.
In addition to mark-to-market and final pricing adjustments, revenue also includes realised gains and losses relating to derivative commodity instruments.
Details of these realised gains or losses are shown in the tables below.
Further details of derivative commodity instruments inplace at the period end are given in Note 26.
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sales are stated net of deductions for tolling charges, as shown in the tables below.
