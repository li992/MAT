com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts 1 General information Northgate plc is a Company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 122.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the strategic report on pages 12 to 38.
The accounts are presented in UK Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
2 Principal accounting policies Statement of compliance The accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group accounts comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of preparation The financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Going concern The accounts continue to be prepared on a going concern basis since the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future as set out on page 30 of the Financial Review.
Changes in accounting policy IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements, IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities and IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements were amended during the year but had no impact on the financial statements.
Various new accounting standards and amendments were issued during the year, none of which have had or are expected to have any significant impact on the Group and effects will principally relate to amendment and extension of current disclosures.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2014 and 30 April 2015.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary undertaking are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts of subsidiary undertakings to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition Group revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of the hire of vehicles, sale of used vehicles and the supply of related goods and services in the normal course of business, net of value added tax and discounts.
Revenue from vehicle hire is recognised evenly over the hire period and revenue from sales of other related goods and services is recognised at the point of sale.
Revenue from the sale of used vehicles is recognised at the point of sale.

Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and interests in associates and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses identified through annual or other tests for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 13 years Intangible assets other Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed three years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Certain properties were revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS.
These valuations were treated as deemed cost at the time of adopting IFRS for the first time.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight line basis over the assets useful estimated lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 50 years or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter Plant, equipment & fittings 3 to 10 years Vehicles for hire 3 to 6 years Motor vehicles 3 to 6 years Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight line basis using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between three and six years.
These depreciation rates have been determined with the anticipation that the net book values at the point the vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line with the open market values for those vehicles.
Depreciation charges reflect adjustments made as a result of differences between expected and actual residual values of used vehicles, taking into account the further directly attributable costs to sell the vehicles.
Property under construction is not depreciated.
Depreciation commences when these assets are ready for their intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of properties revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 2 Principal accounting policies continued Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised in an earlier period, the Group reassesses whether there are any indications that such impairment has decreased or no longer exists.
If an impairment has decreased or no longer exists, an impairment reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent required.
Inventories Used vehicles held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Other inventories comprise spare parts and consumables and are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
23963.02 17 July 2015 3:08 PM Proof 7 FINANCIALS Northgate plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2015 84 85 2 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, where recognition of the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the items being hedged.
The fair value of cross-currency and interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the derivative counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement as a net profit or loss for the period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on the net investment hedges are transferred to the translation reserve.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts.
Bank loans, other loans, loan notes and issue costs Bank loans, other loans and loan notes are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.
com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 2 Principal accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies other than UK Sterling are recorded at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
The net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into UK Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is recognised directly in equity.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated into UK Sterling using average exchange rates for the financial period and variances compared with the exchange rate at the balance sheet date are recognised directly in equity.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are recognised directly in equity, together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity.
They are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, with any variances reflected directly in equity.
All foreign exchange differences reflected directly in equity are shown in the translation reserve component of equity.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments As Lessee: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives using Group policies.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
As Lessor: Motor vehicles and equipment hired to customers under operating leases are included within property, plant and equipment.
Income from such leases is taken to the income statement evenly over the period of the operating lease agreement.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due.
Pension contributions in respect of one of these arrangements are held in trustee administered funds, independently of the Groups finances.
The Group also operates group personal pension plans.
The costs of these plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
23963.02 17 July 2015 3:08 PM Proof 7 FINANCIALS Northgate plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2015 86 87 2 Principal accounting policies continued Employee share schemes and share based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Group issues equity-settled payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and deferred annual bonuses, provide employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company.
Employee share options and deferred annual bonuses are generally subject to performance or service conditions.
The fair value of equity-settled payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist.
The fair value of equity-settled payments granted is measured using the BlackScholes model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market based performance criteria not being met.
The Group also operates a share incentive plan under which employees each have the option to purchase an amount of shares annually and receive an equivalent number of free shares.
The Group recognises the free shares as an expense evenly throughout the period over which the employees must remain in the employ of the Group in order to receive the free shares.
Interest income and finance costs Interest income and finance costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Directors to be material and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the accounts are to be properly understood.
Dividends Dividends on Ordinary shares are recognised in the period in which they are either paid or formally approved, whichever is earlier.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Own shares The Group makes open market purchases of its own shares in order to satisfy the requirements of the Groups existing share schemes.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a reduction in shareholder equity.
The carrying values of own shares are compared to their market values at each reporting date and adjustments are made to write down the carrying value of own shares when, in the opinion of the Directors, there is a significant market value reduction.
com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors have made the following judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts.
Depreciation Vehicles for hire are depreciated on a straight line basis using depreciation rates that reflect economic lives of between three and six years.
Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the Group is required to review its depreciation rates and estimated useful lives regularly to ensure that the net book value of disposals of tangible fixed assets are broadly equivalent to their market value.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
In determining whether provision is required against any trade receivable, judgement is required in estimating the likely levels of recovery.
In exercising this judgement, consideration is given to both the overall economic environment in which a debtor operates, as well as specific indicators that the recovery of the nominal balance may be in doubt, for example days sales outstanding in excess of agreed credit terms or other qualitative information in respect of a customer.
Taxation The Group carries out tax planning consistent with a Group of its size and makes appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax computations are agreed with the tax authorities.
To the extent that tax estimates result in the recognition of deferred tax assets, those assets are only carried in the balance sheet to the extent that it is considered that they are likely to be recovered in the short term.

com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 12 Goodwill 000 Carrying value: At 1 May 2013, 1 May 2014 and 30 April 2015 3,589 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has two cash generating units: the UK and Spain.
The goodwill balance all relates to the UK CGU.
The Group tests its CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that assets might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth rates forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
In addition to the annual test of impairment, and as required by IAS 36, there has also been an assessment as to whether there has been any indication that an impairment loss of other non-current assets recognised in an earlier year has decreased or no longer exists.
The impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in May 2015 using growth rates of 1% over a ten year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 9.7% for the UK CGU and 9.5% for the Spain CGU.
The projected terminal value is calculated based on the Gordon Growth Model assuming cash flows are generated into perpetuity.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment of other non-current assets previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
In the prior year, the impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in May 2014 using growth rates of 1% over a ten year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 9.6% for the UK CGU and 9.9% for the Spain CGU.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
The value in use assessment is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the UK CGU and Spain CGU.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible changes to the assumptions used for either the UK CGU or Spain CGU resulted in an additional impairment charge being required.

It is common practice in Spain for businesses to have a bank facility which enables their suppliers to be paid earlier than under normal credit terms.
When this is the case the supplier pays to Northgate Espaas bank a discount fee for early settlement.
When invoices fall due for payment, Northgate Espaa settles such invoices with its bank.
The Group pays no interest on confirming.
Total borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities at the balance sheet date, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date, are as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Less than one year 5,723 8,172 In one year to five years 169,571 64,617 175,294 72,789 The total amount permitted to be borrowed by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings in terms of the Articles of Association shall not exceed six times the aggregate of the issued share capital of the Company and Group reserves, as defined in those Articles.

At 30 April 2015, the gearing of the Group amounted to 80.7% 2014 90.7% where net borrowings are 337,780,000 2014 346,077,000 and shareholders funds less goodwill and the net book value of intangible assets are 418,426,000 2014 381,677,000.
Financial instruments see also Note 36 financial assets The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk associated with trade receivables in Spain is more concentrated in larger customers than the UK and, consequently, as in the UK the Group has a credit insurance policy in place to mitigate this risk.
com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 20 Borrowings continued Treasury policies and the management of risk The function of Group Treasury is to mitigate financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements, to secure finance at minimum cost and to invest cash assets securely and profitably.
Treasury operations manage the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate risks within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only.
Consistent with Group policy, Group Treasury does not engage in speculative activity and it is policy to avoid using more complex financial instruments.
Further details regarding derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 21.
The policy followed in managing credit risk permits only minimal exposures, with banks and other institutions meeting required standards as assessed normally by reference to major credit rating agencies.
Deals are authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed and which maintain an A rating.
Individual aggregate credit exposures are limited accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk The Groups policy is to finance operating subsidiary undertakings by a combination of retained earnings and medium term bank loans.
Cash at bank, and on deposit, yields interest based principally on interest rate indices applicable to periods of less than three months, those indices being LIBOR for Sterling denominated cash and EURIBOR for Euro denominated cash.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives as detailed in Note 21.
These derivatives are also used to manage the Groups desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the interest cost on outstanding debt.
At 30 April 2015 75.5% 2014 79.8% of net borrowings were at fixed rates of interest comprising interest rate swaps of 105,000,000 and 206,500,000, 500,000 of Preference shares and 541,000 of confirming facilities 30 April 2014 interest rate swaps of 105,000,000 and 206,500,000, 500,000 of Preference shares and 814,000 of confirming facilities.
Foreign currency exchange risk The Group maintains borrowings in the same currency as its cash requirements, with the exception of borrowings maintained in Euros as net investment hedges against its Euro denominated investments Note 21.
An analysis of the Groups borrowings by currency is given below: Sterling Euro Total Group 000 000 000 At 30 April 2015 Bank loans 114,903 231,512 346,415 Cumulative Preference shares 500 500 Confirming facilities 541 541 115,403 232,053 347,456 Sterling Euro Total Group 000 000 000 At 30 April 2014 Bank loans 125,000 238,819 363,819 Cumulative Preference shares 500 500 Confirming facilities 814 814 125,500 239,633 365,133 23963.02 17 July 2015 3:08 PM Proof 7 FINANCIALS Northgate plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2015 102 103 21 Derivative financial instruments The Groups derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date comprise interest rate swaps.

These had weighted average pay rates of 0.68% and 0.48% respectively and all had weighted average lives of 3.6 years.
In April 2014, 50,000,000 of interest rate swaps commenced.
These had weighted average pay rates of 1.40% and weighted average lives of 3.2 years.
All the Groups interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and their fair value to the point of either maturity or termination, along with changes in fair value in the current year, has been deferred in equity.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness during the year 2014 Nil.
Net investment hedges The Group manages its exposure to currency fluctuations on retranslation of the balance sheets of those subsidiary undertakings whose functional currency is in Euros by maintaining a proportion of its borrowings in the same currency.
The hedging objective is to reduce the risk of spot retranslation of the Euro subsidiaries from Euros to Sterling at each reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the borrowings and net investment hedges have been recognised directly within equity along with the exchange differences on retranslation of the net assets of the Euro subsidiaries.
The hedges are considered highly effective in the current and prior year.
Forward exchange contracts At 30 April 2014, the Company held Sterling Euro forward exchange contracts with a notional value of 177,007,000 with a subsidiary undertaking which had a fair value of Nil and weighted average remaining life of 0.5 years.
These matured during the year.

In July 2014 all assets and benefits in relation to the Scheme were bought out and the Group transferred all remaining obligations in relation to the Scheme.
The Group therefore no longer holds any defined benefit pension assets or obligations.
No profit or loss arose on the buyout in the year.
A cost of 2,404,000 was incurred in the prior year in relation to the buy out as detailed in Note 32.
com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 36 Financial instruments The following disclosures and analysis relate to the Groups financial instruments.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 20, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 23 to 31.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in Notes 20 and 21.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis During the year, the Group has been exposed to movements in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling, where Sterling is the functional currency of the Group.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 0.10 2014 0.10 increase and decrease in the Euro Sterling exchange rate.
A 0.10 2014 0.10 movement in the rate in either direction is managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates in the near term.
The sensitivity analysis includes only any outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 0.10 2014 0.10 change in foreign currency rates.

Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities within the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.

For the floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the basis of both the average liability outstanding over the period and the average rate applicable for the period.
In all instances it is assumed that any derivatives designated in hedging relationships are 100% effective.
A 1.0% 2014 1.0% increase or decrease has been used in the analyses and represents managements best estimate of a reasonably possible change in interest rate in the near term.

Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value Outstanding receive floating pay 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 fixed contracts % % 000 000 000 000 Sterling In the second to fifth years inclusive 1.02 1.02 105,000 105,000 524 685 Euro In the second to fifth years inclusive 0.48 0.48 206,500 206,500 1,199 637 Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in Note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values or, in the case of interest rate swaps and cross-currency derivatives, are held at fair value.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.

This enables the Group only to deal with creditworthy customers therefore reducing the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, approximately 893,000 2014 355,000 is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas in the UK and Spain.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 5,569,000 2014 6,407,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

com stock code: NTG Notes to the accounts CONTINUED 36 Financial instruments continued In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and mainly unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
Included in the allowance for doubtful receivables are trade receivables with customers which have been placed under liquidation of 168,000 2014 46,000.
