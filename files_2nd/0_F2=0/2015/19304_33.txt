The facility, which matures on 31 August 2016, is unsecured and is subject to two financial covenants relating to leverage and interest cover.
Prior to 31 December 2015, the Term Loan lenders granted a waiver of the leverage covenant for the year ending 31 December 2015 as a result of which Petrofac was in compliance with its financial covenant obligations for that period.
The loan was fully drawn as of 31 December 2015 31 December 2014: US$500m.
Interest is payable on the facility at US LIBOR 0.85%.
iii Export Credit Agency funding On 26 February 2015, Petrofac entered into a US$58m, 14 year term loan facility guaranteed by the Italian Export Credit Agency SACE.
On 30 July 2015, Petrofac entered into a US$108m term loan facility guaranteed by the UK Export Credit Agency UKEF, on substantially the same terms as the SACE facility.
The two facilities are linked to the procurement of certain goods and services from Italian and UK exporters, respectively, in connection with the construction of the Petrofac JSD6000 vessel.
Repayment of the loans was intended to commence from the date of delivery of the vessel.
Following the termination of the vessel construction contract, the facilities are not currently available for drawing and Petrofac is in discussions with the two Export Credit Agencies to amend the facilities and agree a revised date for the commencement of repayments.
Petrofac cannot be certain that these discussions will result in agreement with the two ECAs, in which case the facilities will be terminated and no further drawings will be made.
As at 31 December 2015, US$17m was drawn under the SACE facility 31 December 2014: US$nil.
No drawings have been made under the UKEF facility.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The assumptions about unobservable inputs relating to available-for-sale investment and the impact on the fair values of the available-for-sale investment as a result of changes to these inputs are disclosed in note 16 to the Groups consolidated financial statements.
