THE GAP IN A range of RMD Kwikforms formwork and shoring equipment was used on the project to build the bridge as part of the SOUTH AFRICA upgrade of the R24 tolled highway running through Rustenburg in the north-west province of South Africa.
Working with the local sub-contractor, RMD engineers designed a method which allowed the bridge to be built while suspended in mid-air by hanging the deck on tie bars from five heavy-duty megatrusses, each weighing 34 tonnes.
These, along with 10 supporting towers, were made using RMDs Megashor shoring product and steel.
The project was carried out over a busy toll road, which could not be closed for a prolonged period.
The solution successfully removed the need for additional traffic management, lane reductions and closures given that at least 200 trucks a day use the road to serve the regional mining industry.
