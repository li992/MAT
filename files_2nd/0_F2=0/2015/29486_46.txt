In particular: Future investment income over the next six years from the existing assets will be sufficient to utilise the unrelieved expenses.
Capital gains crystallising in the unit linked funds will utilise the capital losses.
It is anticipated that the losses will be utilised within approximately ten years.
In the three years from 2013 to 2015 losses with a tax value of 29.0 million have been utilised, indicating an average of approximately 10.0 million per annum, which is consistent with the predicted usage.
Tax assets in relation to deferred income will be utilised over the next 14 years as the underlying income is recognised.
At the reporting date there were unrecognised deferred tax assets of 1.4 million 2014: 0.2 million in respect of losses in companies where appropriate profits are not considered probable in the forecast period.
These losses primarily relate to our Asia based businesses and can be carried forward indefinitely.
During the year 12.1 million 2014: 16.7 million of deferred tax assets relating to capital losses have been utilised and a further 74.8 million 2014: 39.5 million have been recognised.
It is expected that these losses will be utilised over the next ten years, albeit the actual rate of utilisation will depend on business growth and external factors, particularly investment market conditions.
The rate of utilisation has been tested for sensitivity to experience and it is resilient to a range of reasonably forseeable scenarios.
The reductions in the corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective from 1 April 2020 have been incorporated into the deferred tax balances as the changes were enacted in 2015.
