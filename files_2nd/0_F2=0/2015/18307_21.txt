72 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 September 2015 1.
General information Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AX.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 16 November 2015.
These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union EU and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 96 and 97.
Alternative performance measures The Group uses a number of alternative non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures which are not defined within IFRS.
The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and, as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts.
2.1 Adjusted operating profit At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration collectively, acquisition related charges, the costs of a material restructuring or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses or property.
TheDirectors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, adjusted profit before tax is separately disclosed, being defined as adjusted operating profit, after finance expenses but before fair value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests and before tax.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share EPS is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but excluding the tax impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit and the tax effects of goodwill in overseas jurisdictions, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The Directors believe that adjusted EPS provides an important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, free cash flow is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating activities, after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure on business combinations investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Companys shareholders.
The Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future investment or distribution to shareholders.
2.5 Trading capital employed and ROATCE In the segment analysis in note 3, trading capital employed is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and after adding back: borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax and acquisition liabilities in respect of future purchases of minority interests and deferred consideration.
Adjusted trading capital employed is reported as being trading capital employed plus goodwill and acquisition related charges previously written off net of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets.
Return on adjusted trading capital employed ROATCE at the Group and Sector level is defined as the adjusted operating profit, divided by adjusted trading capital employed and adjusted for the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals.
The Directors believe that ROATCE is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
3. Business sector analysis For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business Sectors: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls.
These Sectors form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below.
The principal activities of each of these Sectors is described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39.
Sector revenue represents revenue from external customers: there is no inter-Sector revenue.
Sector results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a Sector, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Sector assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis toa business Sector.
Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business Sector.
These items are shown collectively in the following analysis as unallocated assets and unallocated liabilities, respectively.

Tax expense 2015 2014 m m Current tax The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises: UK corporation tax 2.6 2.6 Overseas tax 12.5 12.1 15.1 14.7 Adjustments in respect of prior year: UK corporation tax 0.1 0.1 Overseas tax 0.4 0.4 Total current tax 15.4 14.2 Deferred tax The net deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises: United Kingdom 1.0 Overseas 0.5 Total deferred tax 1.0 0.5 Total tax on profit for the year 14.4 13.7 In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement benefit scheme and cash flow hedges of 0.1m was credited 2014: 0.1m charge directly to the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
A further Nil 2014: 0.5m was credited to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which relates to share-based payments made during the year, comprising a current tax credit of Nil 2014: 1.0m credit less a deferred tax charge of Nil 2014: 0.5m charge.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year: The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 20.5% to the profit before tax of 51.8m and the amounts set out above is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Profit before tax 51.8 49.8 Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 20.5% 2014: 22.0% 10.6 11.0 Effects of: higher tax rates on overseas earnings 3.7 3.2 adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 0.3 0.5 other permanent differences 0.2 Total tax on profit for the year 14.4 13.7 The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas.
The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 21.0% to 20.0% on 1 April 2015: however as the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in respect of the year ended 30 September 2015 was 20.5% 2014: 22.0% and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above reconciliation.
The Groups net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the US are taxed at rates of up to ca.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2015 have been calculated based on the rate of 20.0% substantively enacted at 30 September 2015.
On 8 July 2015, HM Government announced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The impact of remeasuring the Groups UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at these new rates has not been recognised in these consolidated financial statements as the Finance Bill had not been substantively enacted at 30 September 2015.

Goodwill Life Sciences Seals Controls Total m m m m At 30 September 2013 47.3 16.6 14.6 78.5 Acquisitions 0.3 5.0 0.7 6.0 Exchange adjustments 3.4 0.6 0.3 4.3 At 30 September 2014 44.2 21.0 15.0 80.2 Acquisitions note 22 5.6 8.1 13.7 Adjustment to acquisitions in prior year 0.1 0.1 Exchange adjustments 4.9 0.4 0.2 4.7 At 30 September 2015 44.9 29.6 14.8 89.3 The Group tests goodwill for impairment generally twice a year.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups three operating Sectors.
This reflects the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored by management and better reflects the Groups strategy of acquiring businesses to drive synergies across a Sector, rather than within an individual business.
The impairment test requires a value in use valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted cash flow forecasts.
The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and the Groups strategic plan.
Beyond five years, cash flow projections utilise a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margins, revenue growth rates and the discount rate.
The gross margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience: revenue growth rates generally approximate to the long term average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such as start-ups.
The annual growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts for the next five years represent the budgeted rates for 2016 and thereafter, average growth rates for each Sector: these annual growth rates then reduce to 2% over the longer term.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 77 10.
Goodwill continued The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a single market derived pre-tax discount rate of ca.
This single rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses operating generally in well developed markets and geographies and with robust capital structures.
As these features are consistent between each of the Groups Sectors the Board considers that it is more appropriate to use a single discount rate applied to each Sectors cash flow forecasts.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill in any of the Sectors was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to determine whether a reasonably possible adverse change in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
The analysis indicates that a reasonably possible adverse change would not give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the three Sectors.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 81 19.
Financial instruments The Groups overall management of the financial risks is carried out by a central treasury team under policies and procedures which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating businesses.
The treasury team does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than a small number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short term deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Groups day-to-day operations.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management.
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on page 34 within Internal Control and Risk Management, all of which have been audited.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations: this arises principally from the Groups trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances including deposits held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for each customer.
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision is written off against the underlying receivable.
During the year, the Group had an unrecoverable receivable of 0.2m: there have been no other significant trade receivables written off in the past five years.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk with financial institutions is controlled by the Group treasury team which establishes and monitors counterparty limits.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is AA or better.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: Carrying amount 2015 2014 m m Trade receivables 44.8 41.8 Other receivables 4.0 2.6 Cash and cash equivalents 23.0 21.3 71.8 65.7 There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date.
An analysis of the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is set out in note 18. b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net cash and forecasts cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2015 all covenants were complied with fully.
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on deposits.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also has a committed 40m revolving bank facility with an option to increase its facility to 50m, subject to market pricing which expires on 23 June 2017.
During the year the Group exercised the accordion option in respect of 15m and increased the committed bank facility to 40m in order to provide cash resources to complete an acquisition during the year.
At 30 September 2015, the remaining accordion option available is 10m.
Interest on this facility is payable at between 120 and 170bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
At 30 September 2015, 20m of the facility had been drawn down 2014: Nil.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Expiring within one year Expiring within two years 20.0 Expiring after two years 25.0 82 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2015 19.
Financial instruments continued The Groups financial liabilities are as follows: Carrying amount 2015 2014 m m Trade payables 25.8 26.1 Other payables 2.0 1.2 Other liabilities note 20 6.6 4.0 34.4 31.3 The maturities of the undiscounted financial liabilities are as follows: Less than one year 30.5 28.9 One to two years 0.6 Two to five years 4.7 3.3 35.8 32.2 Less: Discount 1.4 0.9 34.4 31.3 There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date.
c Currency risk The Groups principal currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros and Australian dollars.
The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively.
Net foreign exchange gains of 0.2m 2014: 0.1m were recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Groups businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure to movements in the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and are stated at fair value.
The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2015 was 25.2m 2014: 31.0m.
The net fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2015 was 1.2m 2014: 0.3m.
The amount removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was a 0.3m credit 2014: negligible.
The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was 1.5m 2014: 0.4m.
The currency risk arising from both translational and transactional risks are described further on page 37 within Internal Control and Risk Management.
d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Groups results.
The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from its cash funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates.
All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate.
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one and six months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Groups adjusted profit before tax.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents at the reporting dates is set out in note 18. e Fair values There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value.
The basis for determining fair values are as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end forward rates, adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date with gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts value date is greater than 18 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Other liabilities The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value.

Financial instruments continued f Capital management risk The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide good returns to shareholders which will support the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group comprises cash and cash equivalents, longer term debt which includes bank borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.

As described in note 22, a put call option was recognised during the period at a value of 3.2m 4.1m in respect of the 20% minority interest in TPD, acquired on 6 October 2014.
On 19 December 2014 and following the exercise of a put option, the Group acquired 10% of the minority interest outstanding in Kentek for an initial consideration of 0.6m 0.8m with a further amount payable of 0.8m 1.0m, which is based on the performance of the business in the year ended 30 September 2015.
At 30 September 2015, the estimate of the financial liability to acquire the outstanding minority shareholdings was reassessed by the Directors, based on their current estimate of the future performance of these businesses and to reflect foreign exchange rates at 30 September 2015.
This led to a remeasurement of the fair value of these put options and the liability was reduced by 0.1m 2014: reduced by 0.1m.
This reduction was offset by the charge from unwinding the discount on the liability and in aggregate 0.4m 2014: Nil has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The put options to acquire the minority interest of 20% held in TPD are exercisable in tranches between 2016 and 2019: the put option to acquire the minority interest of 10% held in M Seals is exercisable in October 2018 and the put option relating to the remaining Kentek 10% minority interest is exercisable in two tranches in 2016 and 2018.
At 30 September 2015, deferred consideration of 0.9m included 0.8m 1.0m payable to the vendor of Kentek in respect of the outstanding amount relating to the purchase of his minority interest.
In addition, 0.1m US$0.2m is payable to the vendor of HPS in respect of the performance of the business in the year ended 30 September 2015.
Both these amounts are expected to be paid within the next twelve months.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group maintains two defined benefit pension arrangements which are accounted for under IAS19 Revised Employee Benefits.
The principal arrangement is the defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, maintained by Diploma Holdings PLC and called the Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme the Scheme.
This Scheme provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, leaving service or death and has been closed to further accrual since 5 April 2000.
The second and smaller defined benefit pension arrangement is operated by Kubo in Switzerland and provides benefits on retirement, leaving service or death for the employees of Kubo in accordance with Swiss law.
Kubo was acquired by the Group on 13 March 2015.

Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme The Scheme is subject to a Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004 which requires that a valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013 reported that the Scheme had a funding deficit of 2.7m and held assets which covered 90% of its liabilities at that date.
There were no Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.
The Scheme is managed by a set of Trustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from elections by members of the Scheme.
TheTrustees have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Schemes assets.
TheTrustees delegate some of these functions to their professional advisors where appropriate.
The Scheme exposes the Company and therefore the Group, to a number of risks: Investment risk.
The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, volatility over the short term can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
The Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
Asthe Schemes assets include equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
The Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, however movements over the short term could lead to funding deficits emerging.
In the event that members live longer than assumed, a larger funding deficit may emerge in the Scheme.

The current strategy is designed to broadly match assets and liabilities in respect of pensioner members, but to invest in growth assets in respect of non-pensioners.
Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic pensioners, but the Scheme has not purchased annuities for new retirements since 2005.
Effect of the Scheme on the Groups future cash flows The Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following each triennial actuarial valuation.
Following the triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013, the Company agreed to contribute 0.3m in cash annually to the Scheme.
The next valuation of the Scheme is due at 30 September 2016.
The Kubo Pension Scheme the Kubo Scheme In accordance with Swiss law, Kubos pension benefits are contribution based with the level of benefits varying according to category of employment.
Swiss law requires certain guarantees to be provided on such pension benefits.
Kubo finances its Swiss pension benefits through the Axa Stiftung Berufliche Vorsorge, a pension fund which administers the pension plans of various unrelated employers and reinsures the risks associated with providing guarantees with Axa Winterthur.
Despite the existence of this insurance, IFRS requires such pension schemes in Switzerland to be accounted for as defined pension arrangements, primarily because the insurer has some ability to vary premiums and to decline to continue to provide cover in the future.
