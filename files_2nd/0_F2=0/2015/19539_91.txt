8 Working capital This note provides the amounts invested by the Group in working capital balances at the end of the financial year.
Working capital is made up of inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
Inventories mainly consist of warehouse stock of Sage products, awaiting shipment to business partners or distributors.
Trade and other receivables are made up of amounts owed to the Group by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance.
Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for bad and doubtful debts.
Our trade and other payables are amounts we owe to our suppliers that have been invoiced to us or accrued by us.
They also include taxes and social security amounts due in relation to our role as an employer.
This note also gives some additional detail on the age and recoverability of our trade receivables, which provide an understanding of the credit risk faced by the Group as a part of everyday trading.
Credit risk is further disclosed in the Directors Report.

8.2 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
