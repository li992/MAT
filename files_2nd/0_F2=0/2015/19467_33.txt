96 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation Renishaw plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UKGAAP.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial statements andestimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are noted below.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, subject to items referred to in the derivative financial instruments note below.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in preparing both the 2014 and 2015 financialstatements.
Critical accounting judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities inthenext financial year are listed below: i Inventory Determining the value of inventory requires judgement, especially in respect of provisioning for slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory.
Management consider historic and future forecast sales patterns of individual stock items when calculating inventory provisions.
ii Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values see note 10.
Other estimates and judgements that have been made in these financial statements are as follows: i Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values.
Theseinclude future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases.
Management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are given in note 15. ii Amortisation of intangibles and impairment The periods of amortisation of intangible assets require judgements to be made on the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets todetermine anappropriate rate of amortisation.
Future assessments of impairment may lead to the writing off of certain amounts ofintangible assets and the consequent charge in the Consolidated income statement for the accelerated amortisation.
iii Capitalisation of development costs Product development costs are capitalised once a project has reached a certain stage of development and these costs are subsequently amortised over a five-year period.
Judgements are required to assess whether the new product development has reached the appropriate point for capitalisation of costs to begin.
Should a product be subsequently obsoleted, the accumulated capitalised development costs would need to be immediately written off in the Consolidated income statement.

Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated income statement when the significant risks and rewards ofownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is the time of despatch.
Where certain products require installation, partoftherevenue may be deferred until the installation is complete.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, orthe possible return of goods.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised over the period to which the service relates.
Where goods and services are sold as a bundle, the fair value of services is deferred and recognised over the period to which the service relates with the remaining revenue recognised ondespatch.
New, revised or changes to existing accounting standards The following adopted IFRSs have been applied by the Group for the first time in these financial statements.
a IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities, amendment to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and amendment to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures are a package of new standards and amendments that set out the basis for consolidation and the accounting requirements.
The Group holds 50% stakes in RLS merilna tehnika d. o. o. and Metrology Software Products Limited which are currently accounted for as investments in associates.
The Group has assessed whether it has joint control over these companies under IFRS 11 and has determined that itdoes not have joint control over these entities as decisions over the relevant activities do not require group consent.
These will continue to be accounted for as associates rather than joint ventures.
b Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
This amendment sets out the criteria required for offsetting.
The adoption of these standards has not had a significant effect on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
The following standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board have been adopted by the EU, but only become effective for accounting periods commencing after 30th June 2015: a IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
b IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Group does not currently expect that adoption of these standards will have a significant effect on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group, but may impact disclosure requirements.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries - Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, theGroup takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Associates - Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Application of the equity method to associates - Associates are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation - Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only tothe extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Foreign subsidiaries results are translated into Sterling at weighted average exchange rates for the year, which is effected by translating each foreign subsidiarys monthly results at exchange rates applicable to each of the respective months.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies atthe balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at that date.
Differences on exchange resulting from the translation of overseas assets and liabilities are recognised directly in equity.
Gains and losses arising on currency borrowings used to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the net assets of the foreign operations are accounted for directly in equity, to the extent that hedge accounting criteria are met and are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
See the note on derivative financial instruments below, for the accounting policies for forward exchange contracts and currencyborrowings.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends onthe nature of the item being hedged see below.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be aneffectivehedge is recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income statement.
Theeffectiveness of the hedging is tested monthly.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
Overheads are absorbed into inventories on the basis of normal capacity or on actual hours if higher.
Pension scheme cash escrow account The Company holds a pension scheme escrow account as part of the security given for the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
This account is shown within current assets in the Consolidated balance sheet as it may be used to settle pension scheme liabilities at any time.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Deferred consideration relating to acquisitions is subject to discounting to the date of acquisition and subsequently unwound to the date of the final payment.
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, net of deferred tax.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless ofwhether those rights are separable.
Where there exists an option to purchase the non-controlling interest of a subsidiary and the option is deemed to have been exercised, the Group has adopted the  method.
Any changes to the carrying amount of the liability are recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred tothe Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
It is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or earlier if there are any indications of impairment.
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets such as customer lists, patents, trade marks, know-how and intellectual property that are acquired by the Group are stated atcost less amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over theestimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets included in the Consolidated balance sheet reflect the benefit derived by the Group and vary from five to ten years.
On a transaction by transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest inthe recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
All other non-controlling interests are measured attheir fair value at the acquisition date.
Where there are changes to the Companys interests in subsidiaries while retaining control, any differences between the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted and fair value of consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity in the other reserve.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 99 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2015 1.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends and has the technical ability andsufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over five years and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Capitalised development expenditure is removed from the balance sheet ten years after being fully amortised.
Intangible assets software licences Intangible assets comprising software licences, that are acquired by the Group, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
The useful life of each ofthese assets is assessed on an individual basis and they range from two to ten years.
Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost ofassets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years Vehicles 3 to 4 years Warranty provisions The Group provides a warranty from the date of purchase on all its products.
This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
A warranty provision is included in the financial statements, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Dividends Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately declared and authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Employee benefits The Group operates contributory pension schemes, largely for UK, Ireland and USA employees, which were of the defined benefit type up to 5th April 2007, 31st December 2007 and 30th June 2012 respectively, at which time they ceased any future accrual for existing members and were closed to new members.
The schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the group finances.
Pension scheme assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate ofreturn onahigh-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest.
The Company recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans are included in the Consolidated income statement.
The pension schemes surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the Consolidated balance sheet under employee benefits.
Where a guarantee is in place in relation to a pension scheme deficit, liabilities are reported in accordance with IFRIC 14.
Foreign-based employees are covered by state, defined benefit and private pension schemes in their countries of residence.
Actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes were not obtained, apart from Ireland and USA, because of the limited number of foreign employees.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the Consolidated income statement represents the contributions payable to the schemes inrespect of the accounting period.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken.

Accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term with an original maturity of less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated statement of cash flow.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items which due to their size, incidence and non-recurring nature have been classified separately in order to draw them tothe attention of the reader of the accounts and, in managements judgement, to show more accurately the underlying results of the Group.
Such items areincluded within the Consolidated income statement caption to which they relate and are disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic report, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions.
In addition, note 22 in the financial statements includes the Groups objectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts.
Cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts are recognised at fair value.
Where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part ofany gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement immediately.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the Consolidated income statement immediately.
The effectiveness of cash flow hedges is tested on a monthly basis by comparing the cash inflows with the hedging amounts.
Taxation Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except tothe extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired has arisen on the acquisition of a number of businesses and has an indeterminable useful life.
Therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs, which are currently the statutory entities acquired.
This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Groups operating segments.
In the table below, only the goodwill relating to the acquisition of R&R Fixtures, LLC is expected to be subject to tax relief.
The analysis of acquired goodwill on consolidation is: 2015 2014 000 000 itp GmbH 2,456 2,770 Renishaw Diagnostics Limited 92.4% 1,784 1,784 Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
75% 1,537 1,487 Measurement Devices Limited 6,661 6,661 Renishaw Software Limited 1,559 1,559 R&R Fixtures, LLC 4,411 4,050 Other smaller acquisitions 1,328 1,364 Total acquired goodwill 19,736 19,675 The recoverable amounts of acquired goodwill are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections with assumptions as follows: itp GmbH and Renishaw Software Limited both part of the metrology segment actual operating results and an average growth rate of 5%for five years with anil growth rate to perpetuity 2014: same basis.
Renishaw Diagnostics Limited, Renishaw Mayfield S. A. both in the healthcare segment, Measurement Devices Limited and R&RFixtures, LLC both in the metrology segment five-year business plans with a nil growth rate to perpetuity 2014:samebasis.
These are considered prudent estimates based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
The growth rates used in the business plans vary from 20% to 34%, except for Renishaw Diagnostics Limited, which is in its research and development phase and thus has negligible revenue to date.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows of itp GmbH, Renishaw Software Limited, Measurement Devices Limited and R&RFixtures, LLC 2014: 12%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 15% has been used for Renishaw Diagnostics Limited and Renishaw Mayfield S. A.
The discount rates have been derived by comparison with rates adopted by other market participants, adjusted to reflect Group and CGU specific risks.
On this basis, no impairment write-downs are required.
There is significant headroom in all except Measurement Devices Limited and for an impairment to arise, there would need to be a significant material deterioration in business: this is considered to be remote.
An increase of 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment, except for Measurement Devices Limited, where, with a headroom of 1.7m, the discount rate would have to increase to 14.5%.

Employee benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
As noted in the accounting policies, actuarial valuations of foreign pension schemes are not obtained for the most part because of the limited number of foreign employees.
The major scheme, which covers the UK-based employees, was of the defined benefit type.
This scheme, along with the Ireland and USA defined benefit schemes, has ceased any future accrual for current members and these schemes are closed to new members.
UK, Ireland andUSA employees are now covered by defined contribution schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was carried out as at September 2012 and updated to 30th June 2015 by aqualified independent actuary.
The mortality assumption used for 2015 is S2PMA and S2PFA tables, CMI core 2014 model with long-term improvements of 0.2% per annum.
Note C. 36 gives the analysis of the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
For the other schemes, the market value of assets at the end of theyear was 14,410,000 2014: 12,752,000 and the actuarial value of liabilities was 16,644,000 2014: 18,544,000.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 24 years.
For a sensitivity analysis of certain elements of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, see the financial review section of theStrategic report.
Itis expected that contributions to defined benefit schemes for the next financial year will be at a similar level to the currentyear.

The Company has also established an escrow account, which is subject to a registered floatingcharge to secure the UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
Thebalance of this account was 14,731,000 at the end oftheyear 2014:9,541,000.
The Company has given a guarantee relating to recovery plans for the UK defined benefit pension scheme and the trustees have the right toenforce the charges to recover any deficit up to 48,200,000 if an insolvency event occurs in relation to the Company before 30th September 2016 or if the Company has not made good any deficit up to 48,200,000 by midnight on 30th September 2016.
No scheme assets are invested in the Groups own equity.
The value of the guarantee discussed above is greater than the value of the pension schemes deficit.
As such, in line with IFRIC 14, theUKdefined benefit pension schemes liabilities have been increased by 10,200,000, to represent the maximum discounted liability asat30thJune 2015 2014: 8,000,000.

Financial instruments The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Credit risk The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of the Groups financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Cash 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Currency 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pound Sterling 8,029 9,097 8,541 7,863 146,603 102,113 US Dollar 32,400 30,418 3,882 15,696 31,752 22,404 Japanese Yen 10,660 7,093 9,388 13,397 11,431 9,050 Euro 18,701 18,858 14,720 4,055 31,959 30,521 Other 31,423 16,332 1,671 1,828 10,710 3,496 101,213 81,798 38,202 42,839 82,171 43,634 The above trade receivables, other receivables and cash are predominately held in the functional currency of the relevant entity, with the exception of 3,511,000 of Euro-denominated trade receivables being held in the Company, along with some foreign currency cash balances which are of a short-term nature.
Also, see note below on net assets and associated borrowings, regarding the holding of foreign currency borrowings by the Company in respect of its hedging activity.
The ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 2015 2014 000 000 Past due 01 month 16,636 13,854 Past due 12 months 5,163 3,122 Past due more than 2 months 2,372 1,903 Balance at the end of the year 24,171 18,879 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 2015 2014 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 2,979 3,525 Changes in amounts provided 509 89 Amounts utilised 524 457 Balance at the end of the year 2,964 2,979 Liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on LIBOR LIBID, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 700,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined byreference to market data.

Market risk As noted in the Strategic report under Principal risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority ofsales being made in these currencies but with most manufacturing being undertaken in the UK, Ireland and India.
Fair value There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost, apart from the forward exchange contracts, which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated income statement unless subject to hedge accounting.
The fair values of the forward exchange contracts have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future exchange rates, representing level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The IFRS 13 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro revenues and hence the impact on the Groups results resulting from fluctuations in these exchange rates against Sterling is lessened.
The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent change, a one Japanese Yen change and a one Euro cent change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.

Financial instruments continued The Company has US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro forward contracts which mature after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of these contracts at the year end resulted in a profit carried forward of 17,171,000 2014: profit 25,580,000 see note 21.
The nominal amounts of foreign currencies relating to these forward contracts are, in Sterling terms, 353,044,000 in US Dollars 2014: 245,824,000, 26,042,000 in Japanese Yen 2014: 47,087,000 and 107,904,000 in Euro 2014: 121,326,000.
The Group classifies these forward contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The forward contracts cover monthly revenues over the next three and a half years.
Further details are noted in the treasury policies in the financial review section of the Strategic report.
Net assets and associated borrowings The Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were: Net assets of Currency Base borrowing subsidiary borrowing interest rate Currency 000 000 % US Dollar 44,549 36,875 0.28 Japanese Yen 15,912 14,139 0.09 Euro 39,933 35,407 -0.02 The currency borrowings are short term, with floating interest rates.
For the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries not hedged, a 1% change in exchange rates will affect reserves by approximately 700,000.
Capital management The Group defines capital as being the equity attributable to the owners of the Company, which is captioned on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base and to maintain a balance between significant returns to shareholders, with a progressive dividend policy, whilst ensuring the security of the Group supported by a sound capital position.
The Group may adjust dividend payments due to changes in economic and market conditions which affect, or are anticipated to affect, group results.
