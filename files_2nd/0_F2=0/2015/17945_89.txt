Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the group on profit or loss before taxation.
With effect from 1 April 2015 the UK statutory corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea.
For 2015, the items presented in the reconciliation are affected as a result of the overall tax credit for the year and the loss before taxation.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses, and for the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and impairment losses in isolation.
For 2014, the items presented in the reconciliation are affected as a result of the tax credits related to the impairment losses recognized in the year and the effect of the impairment losses on the profit for the year.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate for 2014, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the effects of the impairment losses, and for the effects of the impairment losses in isolation.
