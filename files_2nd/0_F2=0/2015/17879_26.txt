73 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Key accounting policies Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group.
The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 106 to 112. a Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Groups underlying performance.
The face of the Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 12, is calculated having adjusted profit after tax for the same items and their tax effect.
The term adjusted profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and are included on pages 100 to 104. b Revenue The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises initial licence fees, annual licence fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is deferred until payment is due.
Initial annual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract, which is typically twelve months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-cancellable and consist of two separate components: the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
74 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Key accounting policies continued The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
Services Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
c Exceptional items The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
d Significant accounting estimates Revenue recognition Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
We generally only enter into this type of contract in Enterprise Solutions but the assessments and estimates used by the Group could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised on a project.
We periodically review our estimate of the fair value of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance.
On average, this element as a proportion of the initial software delivery element has increased from 15% to 17%.
This revised estimate has been used for revenue recognition purposes from 1 April 2014.
The impact of this change was that revenue recognised during 2014 15 was lower by 894,000, and deferred revenue at 31 March 2015 increased by 894,000.
Provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2015 was 5,636,000 2014 5,161,000.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 14.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for tax.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain particularly when doing business in emerging economies.
The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due.
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made.
75 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Key accounting policies continued Retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied, together with sensitivity analysis, are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2015 was 14,187,000 2014 8,848,000. e Impairment of Assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative expenses line item.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 27.
Details of the calculation of adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2015 2014 000 000 Profit after tax for the year 41,559 51,011 Intangible amortisation excluding software 4,707 4,677 Share-based payments 441 2,317 Loss gain on fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts 980 1,121 Exceptional items 1,990 3,395 Tax effect on exceptional items 134 781 Tax effect on other normalised items 1,067 1,351 Adjusted profit after tax 47,594 58,147 The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share.
The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has been adjusted for the tax effects of the items adjusted.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is a more representative presentation of the underlying performance of the business.
81 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13 Business combinations On 5 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of 8over8 Limited headquartered in Northern Ireland.
The acquisition consideration was cash of 26.9 million.
Acquisition costs including due diligence and professional fees and integration costs have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
Details of the fair values of the net assets acquired and goodwill is set out below, which includes purchased intangibles consisting of developed technology and customer relationships.
Fair value adjustments of 6.9 million have been made to align with the Groups accounting policies, particularly in respect of revenue recognition.

It is not practical to disclose the revenue and profit loss before tax of the business as if it had been acquired at the beginning of the reporting period due to the nature of the fair value adjustment to align accounting policies.
Goodwill represents the value of the assembled workforce and the future synergy benefits of integrating the business in the AVEVA Group.
The assembled workforce brings product development skills and expertise, service delivery skills and domain knowledge of the end user markets to the Group.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Engineering & Design Systems During 2014 15 the contribution of the Engineering & Design Systems CGU was 137.0 million 2014 163.0 million.
This is far in excess of the attributable goodwill value.
Therefore, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
Enterprise Solutions The goodwill acquired relating to 8over8 Limited has been allocated to the Enterprise Solutions ES segment.
However, the carrying values of the ES intangibles have for 2014 15 been assessed for impairment excluding both the very recently acquired 8over8 intangibles and the related acquired cash flows.
82 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Goodwill continued The review for the Enterprise Solutions CGU was conducted prior to the year end and the recoverable amount, as per IAS 36, was determined to be the fair value less costs to sell FVLCS, being greater than the value in use that had been employed in the prior year.
The FVLCS assessment was prepared by a third-party valuation specialist who performed his work by reference to market data.
The specialist employed two methods to inform his valuation: one based on companies: and the second based on transactions: Under the Guideline Company method companies in a similar market sector were observed and those that were identified as loss-making were used to derive an estimated average revenue multiple that could be applied to the ES CGU.
A revenue multiple of 1.1 times revenue was selected.
As the multiple selected was based on observable quoted company multiples, the resulting valuation was then adjusted upward to reflect a 15% premium for any potential acquirer having acquired full control.
Conversely, the valuation estimate multiple was discounted by 7% to reflect a potential lack of marketability, due to a lack of a ready market for the asset.
Both the control premium and lack of marketability adjustments are standard in such a valuation technique.
Under the Guideline Transaction method GTM, actual corporate transactions in a similar industry or sector and of a similar scale were observed and valuation multiples assessed.
Focus was given to the total invested capital to revenue multiples, due to the lack of profitability of the ES CGU.
These were found to range from 1.0 times to 3.01 times revenue.
On the basis that the Enterprise Solutions CGU is currently loss making, it was deemed appropriate to select a lower quartile multiple of revenue, 1.09 times.
From this process, the FVLCS valuation was assessed as between 28.8 million and 30.3 million, indicating headroom of between 18.9 million and 20.4 million against the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles of 9.9m.
As the valuation approach described above has used lower quartile assessments of valuation multiples, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the valuation assumptions used by the valuation specialist would lead to impairment.
Currently the carrying values of the goodwill and intangibles attributable to the ES CGU represent 0.38 times revenue reported in 2014 15.
Developed technology Developed technology includes the 8over8 technology acquired in 2014 15, the Bocad technology acquired in 2012 13, the MARS technology which was acquired as part of the acquisition of Logimatic Software A S in 2010 11, the ADB technology that was also acquired in 2010 11 and the LFM software acquired in 2011 12.
All amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over periods between five and twelve years.

These leases have a duration of between one and five years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
24 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 765,000 2014 727,000 and profit after tax by 604,000 2014 560,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
87 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial risk management continued The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, South Korean Won, and Yen, reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies, whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research & Development, are settled in Sterling, Indian Rupees and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
In addition, it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively.
At 31 March 2015, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $22.8 million 2014 $9.0 million, 9.7 million 2014 9.75 million and YEN0 million 2014 YEN100.0 million.
It also had outstanding currency exchange contracts to buy, Swedish kr0 million 2014 kr11.5 million, Danish kr4.5 million 2014 kr0 million.
Non-deliverable forward contracts were used to hedge the purchase of INR30 million 2014 INR0 million The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling, and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013 14.
Increase decrease in average Profit loss Equity 31 March 2015 rate 000 000 US Dollar 10% 2,190 2,190 10% 2,450 2,450 Euro 10% 70 70 10% 77 77 Increase decrease in Profit loss Equity 31 March 2014 average rate 000 000 US Dollar 10% 869 869 10 % 956 956 Euro 10% 241 241 10 % 265 265 b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counter-parties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
As set out in the Groups treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counter-party is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum of 50% of the Groups total counter-party risk.
Within this overall limit, some counter-parties are subject to more restrictive caps on counter-party exposure.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
88 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 Financial risk management continued The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 18. c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Groups financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2015 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 433,000 at 31 March 2015 2014 547,000 asset.
The resulting loss of 980,000 2014 gain of 1,121,000 on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
f Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2014 or 2015.
During 2013 14 a special dividend of 147 pence per share, totalling 100 million, was paid and this was accompanied by a share consolidation of 15 new ordinary shares for every 16 ordinary shares held.
This reduced the number of shares in issue at the time of the share consolidation from 68,115,648 to 63,858,420 and also amended the nominal value of the shares to 3.56 pence each.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.
90 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon during the current and previous year: Decelerated Retirement capital Land and benefit Intangible Share allowances buildings obligations assets options Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2013 27 155 3,040 2,953 1,183 3,122 4,210 Acquisition 193 193 Credit charge to Income statement 99 25 358 246 27 203 188 Credit charge to other comprehensive income 1,511 236 1,275 Charged to equity 412 412 Exchange adjustment 14 376 390 At 31 March 2014 58 130 1,171 2,471 744 2,756 2,128 Acquisition 2,428 644 1,328 456 Credit charge to Income statement 176 64 1,065 107 718 Credit charge to other comprehensive income 1,085 380 1,465 Charge to equity 126 126 Exchange adjustment 25 52 27 At 31 March 2015 209 130 2,256 4,455 197 4,243 2,320 A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2015 2014 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 1,480 2,003 Deferred tax assets 3,800 4,131 2,320 2,128 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,654,000 2014 865,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 533,000 2014 276,000, 40,000 2014 68,000 has been recognised and is included in other above.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 37,003,000 2014 37,693,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.

This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002, was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004 and then closed to future accrual from 31 March 2015.
No service cost or curtailment gain arose upon closure of the scheme, due to all previously accrued past service benefits retaining the same link to future inflation or future earnings.
Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.
There is an insurance policy in place which covers this liability.

Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH has been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad employees.
At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.
In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which results in the insurance company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.

d Other retirement schemes All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements.
The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company.
It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component.
AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee.
AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme.
At 31 March 2015, Alectas surplus in the form of collective funding level was 148% 2014 147% which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies.
