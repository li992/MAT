10 Intangible assets 000 Cost and carrying amount At 30 December 2013, 28 and 29 December 2014 and 27 December 2015 26,433 Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to an impairment review annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to its carrying value.
The intangible assets reported on the balance sheet represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub restaurants.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.1% 2014: 9.7% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in the discount rate of 1% A decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in forecast cash flows.

Awards under the LTIP are granted to executive Directors and senior management in the form of nil cost options.
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options are granted to Directors and selected employees.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares by a specified date, known as deposited shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for these Matching Award share options to be exercisable.
The table below summarises the dates of awards under the LTIP and the dates by which Directors and employees were required to acquire their deposited shares.
Date by which deposited Date of award shares must be acquired 28 February 2013 30 June 2013 27 February 2014 30 June 2014 3 March 2015 30 June 2015 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment or in accordance with good leaver status as set out in the scheme rules.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal vesting date.
The Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 1 March 2012 became exercisable on 1 March 2015.
The performance criteria was based on total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was ranked in the upper quartile against its comparator group and consequently the TSR element of the award vested in full.
In respect of the EPS element of the award, the growth in EPS was between RPI 4% p. a. and RPI 10% p. a. and 88% of this part of the award vested.
For those awards granted on 28 February 2013 that vest in 2016, the performance criteria were based on TSR and EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was ranked between median and upper quartile against its comparator group and consequently 85% of the TSR element of the award will vest.
In respect of the EPS element of the award the growth in EPS was above RPI 10% p. a. and 100% of this part of the award will vest.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through shares purchased via a trust.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three year savings period.
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

In order to calculate volatility, the movement in the return index has been calculated share price plus dividends reinvested over a period prior to the grant date equal in length to the remaining period over which the performance condition applies.
For the discount for the TSR performance condition for the relevant Conditional and Matching Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 2.8 years prior to the grant has been used.
For the discount for the SAYE scheme, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3.25 years prior to the grant has been used.

Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 2.18% 2014: 3.00%.
In June 2015, the Company agreed a five year extension of the existing 140m rolling loan facility.
This facility provides the Company with medium-term security of funding, additional capacity to take advantage of business opportunities as they become available and the flexibility to optimise the Companys funding structure.
The covenants and obligations of the facility extension remain the same as the previous agreement and interest remains payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
84 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.

85 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of commercial discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 3.7m from BH Restaurants Limited.
As a result of a detailed trading review of the business, the Board has made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 12.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in June 2020 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors.
d Foreign currency risk The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
Following the closure of the Groups three restaurants in Spain in 2011, any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is marginal and relates to the outstanding transactions in relation to the termination of the Spanish business.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group does not currently have any interest rate swaps in place as the continued reduction in the level of debt combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
86 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 24 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Minimum Present value of lease payments minimum lease payments 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 Within one year 355 332 355 332 Within two to five years 1,420 1,326 1,089 1,017 After five years 11,630 11,475 1,867 1,913 13,405 13,133 Less: future interest payments 10,094 9,871 Present value of lease obligations 3,311 3,262 3,311 3,262 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 355 332 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,956 2,930 Present value of lease obligations 3,311 3,262 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.3m 2014: 3.3m.
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2015 2015 2014 2014 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 67,364 2,023 57,902 2,642 Within two to five years 233,242 6,756 200,990 8,523 After five years 497,972 18,561 451,385 20,477 798,578 27,340 710,277 31,642 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concessions business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
87 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Capital commitments 2015 2014 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 42,650 45,551 26 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
27 Related party transactions There were no related party transactions in the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015.
