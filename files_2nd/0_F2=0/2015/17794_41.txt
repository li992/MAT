The most critical of these relate to impairment of arrangement.

Where discounted cash flow models based on managements assumptions are used, the resulting fair value measurements are considered to be at level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as they depend to a significant extent on unobservable valuation inputs.
The determination of assumptions used in assessing the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities is subjective and the use of different valuation assumptions could have a significant impact on financial results.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Groups segments are aligned to the structure of the existing business units based around commodities, as at 31 December 2015.
Each business unit has a management team that is accountable to the Chief Executive, and in the instance of Copper, Nickel, Niobium and Phosphates, the same management team is responsible for the management of all four business units, collectively referred to as Base Metals and Minerals.
Niobium and Phosphates are not considered to be individually significant to the Group and are therefore aggregated, having previously been presented separately.
To align with the management structure of the Groups coal businesses and the way their results are internally reported, Coal South Africa, Coal Colombia and Coal Australia and Canada are reported together as the Coal segment.
The Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil and Samancor business units have been aggregated as the Iron Ore and Manganese segment on the basis of the ultimate product produced ferrous metals.
The Corporate and other segment comprises the Other Mining and Industrial business unit, which is not considered to be individually significant to the Group, together with unallocated corporate costs and exploration costs.
Exploration costs represent the cost of the Groups exploration activities across all segments.
The Group Management Committee evaluates the financial performance of the Group and its segments principally with reference to underlying earnings before interest and tax underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT is operating profit presented before special items and remeasurements and includes the Groups attributable share of associates and joint ventures underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT of associates and joint ventures is the Groups attributable share of revenue less operating costs before special items and remeasurements of associates and joint ventures.
Underlying EBITDA is underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and joint operations and includes the Groups attributable share ofassociates and joint ventures underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation.
Segment revenue includes the Groups attributable share of associates and joint ventures revenue.
Segments predominantly derive revenue as follows Platinum: platinum group metals: fide Beers: rough and polished diamonds: Copper: copper: Nickel: nickel: Niobium and Phosphates: niobium and phosphates: Iron Ore and Manganese: iron ore, manganese ore and alloys: Coal: metallurgical coal and thermal coal.
The segment results are stated after elimination of inter-segment transactions and include an allocation of corporate costs.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS Special items and remeasurements are those items of financial performance that, due to their size and nature, the Group believes should beseparately disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Special items that relate to the operating performance of the Group are classified as operating special items and principally include impairment charges andrestructuring costs.
Non-operating special items include costs in relation to closure of operations, profits and losses on disposal of investments and businesses as well as certain adjustments relating to business combinations.
Remeasurements include: Unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities that represent economic hedges, including accounting hedges related to financing arrangements.
Where the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are reversed from remeasurements and are recorded in underlying earnings in the same year as the underlying transaction for which the instruments provide the economic hedge.
If the underlying transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in remeasurements on settlement of the derivative.
Such amounts are classified in the income statement as operating when the underlying exposure is in respect of the operating performance of the Group and otherwise as financing.
The remeasurement and subsequent depreciation and amortisation of a previously held equity interest as a result of a business combination.
Foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local currency financial information and hence deferred tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations.
Such amounts are reported as tax remeasurements within income tax expense.

Operating special items Impairments: Iron ore and coal operations During 2015 a number of factors, including slowing of the expected rate of economic growth in China, together with a rebalancing of the Chinese economy, have driven a fundamental shift in the commodity demand outlook.
At the same time, excess supply of a number of commodities, notably steel-making materials including iron ore and hard coking coal, is likely to persist in the short to medium term, further weighing on the prices of these commodities.
Consequently, the valuations of the Groups iron ore and hard coking coal operations have been reviewed based on the latest operating assumptions and managements current estimates of future commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.
This has resulted in a number of asset impairments which are detailed below.
The valuations prepared as at 31 December 2015 assume that prices and foreign exchange rates will remain close to those that prevailed in the final quarter of 2015 for a threeto five-year period with a gradual recovery thereafter as supply tightens and producer country economies recover.
The longand short-term price assumptions used in the valuations are within the range of published analyst forecasts.
Minas-Rio The Minas-Rio iron ore project Minas-Rio Iron Ore and Manganese in Brazil was acquired in two separate transactions in 2007 and 2008.
Production commenced in 2014 and First Ore On Ship FOOS was delivered in October 2014.
In 2012, an impairment charge of $4,960 million before tax was recorded against the carrying value of Minas-Rio.
This was based on the value in use of the CGU and reflected an increase in estimate of attributable project capital expenditure to $8.8 billion, including a $0.6 billion contingency, as well as the impact of high inflation on operational costs.
In 2014, a further impairment charge of $3,800 million before tax was recorded due to a continued decline in the pricing environment for iron ore based on a value in use of $5.6 billion.
At the time it was highlighted that the valuation remained sensitive to price and further deterioration in prices might result in additional impairment.
126 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT 6.
SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued In June 2015 the Group recorded an additional impairment charge of $2,503 million before tax against the carrying value of the CGU, driven by a further deterioration in iron ore pricing.
The valuation of Minas-Rio, based on the value in use of the CGU, determined on a pre-tax discounted cash flow basis seenote 1 real pre-tax discount rate of 8.5% 2014: 8.5% was $3.6 billion as at 30 June 2015.
This charge was recorded against capital works in progress.
A related deferred tax asset of $404million was also written down to reflect a reduced likelihood of recovering the associated tax deductions.
The valuation of Minas-Rio was re-assessed as at 31 December 2015 in light of the continued decline in iron ore prices.
No further impairment has been recorded as the impact of lower pricing in the short term has been offset by a number of factors, notably a significant weakening of the Brazilian real.
However, the valuation remains sensitive to price, and to assumptions regarding the permit and licence issuance schedule.
Adverse changes to these assumptions could result in further impairments.
Sishen The Sishen iron ore mine Iron Ore and Manganese is located in the Northern Cape Province in South Africa.
As a result of the deterioration in the iron ore market, management has undertaken a strategic review to reconfigure the Sishen pit in order to optimise margins.
The new pit shell configuration will enable amore flexible mining approach and lower unit costs and capital expenditure over the Life ofMine.
Whilst these measures have been undertaken to respond to the impact of the weaker iron ore price environment, a pre-tax impairment charge of $514 million $372 million after tax has been recorded against the carrying value of the CGU, based on a valuation of $1.3 billion.
The valuation has been assessed based on the assets fair value less costs of disposal and measured using discounted cash flow projections see note 1.
Of the impairment charge, $184 million has been recorded against mining properties and leases, $55 million against land and buildings, $61 million against capital works in progress and $214 million against plant and equipment, with an associated tax credit of $142 million.
The valuation remains sensitive to price and execution of the new pit design, and adverse changes to these assumptions could result in further impairments.
Coal In June 2015, a pre-tax impairment of $624 million $437 million after tax was recorded in relation to the Coal Australia assets, principally comprising an impairment of $539 million atCapcoal.
In the second half of the year, further pre-tax impairments totalling $429 million have been recorded against the Groups metallurgical coal operations in central Queensland, driven by the impact of weak coal prices on margins, particularly for the open cut operations.
The post-tax impairment charge is also $429million.
This comprises an additional impairment of $100 million at Capcoal, based on a valuation of $0.2 billion, $234 million at Dawson, based on avaluation of $0.2 billion, and $95 million at Foxleigh, which has been fully impaired.
Of this charge, $201 million has been recorded against plant and equipment, $155 million against mining properties and leases, $41 million against land and buildings and $32 million against capital works in progress.
The remaining impairment charge of $165 million relates to Peace River Coal in Canada which was fully impaired at 30 June 2015.
The post-tax impairment charge is also $165 million.
The valuations have been assessed based on the respective operations fair value less costs of disposal and measured using discounted cash flow projections see note 1.
The valuation of the Groups Coal Australia assets remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in pricing could result in additional impairments.
Other impairments Platinum During 2015 there has been a significant deterioration in platinum group metals PGM market conditions.
Although, in the near term, the growth outlook forPGMs is unclear due to potentially reduced platinum jewellery demand in China and uncertainty surrounding the auto-catalyst market, longer term demandisforecast to be robust given the expected demand for new and cleaner vehicles in maturing economies, coupled with increasingly stringent global emissionslegislation.
The Group has taken a number of steps to respond to these conditions.
These include restructuring the business to reduce overheads, cutting cash negative production, and suspending capital expenditure on growth projects other than those that are already near completion.
In the second half of 2015, development of the Twickenham project has been suspended.
Existing operations at Twickenham will be placed on care and maintenance during 2016 and the project is being reconfigured for the longer term as a largely mechanised underground operation.
As a result, some of the previously capitalised costs associated with the development of Twickenham as a conventional mine, along with related assets and infrastructure, are no longer expected to provide future economic benefits, resulting in an impairment charge of $236 million.
In addition, as a result of the review of capital projects across the Platinum business, further capitalised development costs and assets of $42 million have been written off.
The Group, along with Atlatsa Resources Corporation Atlatsa, the controlling shareholder of Bokoni, has conducted a technical review of the Bokoni operation to optimise the mine plan and allow it to operate on a cash-positive basis.
The revised plan is currently being implemented but Bokoni is likely to remain cash negative for some time.
Consequently, the Group has fully impaired its equity interests in Bokoni, which comprise a 49% interest in the underlying operation, and a 23% interest in Atlatsa.
In addition, the Group has fully impaired the loans it has extended to Atlatsa and Atlatsa Holdings the controlling Black Economic Empowerment shareholder of Atlatsa.
The total impairment charge relating to Bokoni is $212 million, of which $93 million has been recorded against Investments in associates and $119 million against Financial asset investments.
The Group holds a 33% interest in the Bafokeng-Rasimone Platinum Mine BRPM and a 12% shareholding in Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited RBPlat, theJohannesburg Stock Exchange listed controlling shareholder of the operation.
Given the reduction in the market capitalisation of RBPlat, the carrying value of the investment in BRPM has been assessed for impairment.
This has resulted in an impairment of $178 million which has been recorded against Investments in associates.
In addition, cumulative fair value losses of $52 million on the Groups 12% investment in RBPlat, which have previously been recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, have been recycled to the income statement as an impairment loss, as the decline in RBPlats market value is considered to have been significant and prolonged.
The aggregate pre-tax impairment charge is $720 million and the aggregate post-tax impairment charge is $642 million.
Snap Lake fide Beers Following a review of the operation, and in light of current market conditions, management has decided to place the Snap Lake operation, located in the North West Territory in Canada, on long term care and maintenance.
A pre-tax impairment of $595 million has been recorded.
The carrying value associated with the operation, comprising $502 million of mining properties and leases, is considered unlikely to provide future economic benefit and has been reduced to nil.
The remainder of the impairment charge relates to the write-off of associated goodwill, redundant consumables and provisions for severance costs and similar items.
The aggregate post-tax impairment charge is also $595 million.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued El Soldado Copper The Group holds a 50.1% interest in the El Soldado copper mine, which is part of Anglo American Sur.
To mitigate the impact of the recent deterioration in copper prices, management has made changes to the mine sequencing, in order to optimise cash flows in the near term.
Despite these modifications, an impairment of $274 million before tax has been recorded against the carrying value of the asset.
The valuation of the asset, based on the operations fair value less costs of disposal and measured using discounted cash flow projections see note 1, is $0.2 billion.
Of this charge, $202 million has been recorded against mining properties and leases and $72 million against plant and equipment with an associated tax credit of $82million.
The post-tax impairment charge is $192 million.
The valuation is sensitive to price and further deterioration might result in additional impairment.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs of $148 million 2014: $128 million relate to organisational changes as part of the Driving Value programme.
The post-tax charge is $119million 2014: $107 million.
2014 Operating special items in 2014 principally comprise impairments and related charges in respect of Minas-Rio and Peace River Coal.
Operating remeasurements Operating remeasurements reflect a net loss of $178 million 2014: $1 million which principally comprises losses of $78 million 2014: gains of$136 million in respect of derivatives related to capital expenditure in Iron Ore Brazil and a $99 million depreciation and amortisation charge 2014: $129million arising due to the fair value uplift on the Groups pre-existing 45% shareholding in fide Beers, which was required on acquisition of a controlling stake.
The post-tax loss is $123 million 2014: $27 million.
Derivatives in relation to Iron Ore Brazil which have been realised during the period had a cumulative net operating remeasurement loss of $162 million 2014:$140 million.
Non-operating special items Rustenburg On 9 September, Anglo American Platinum announced that it had entered into a binding agreement to sell the Rustenburg mine to Sibanye Gold Limited, subject to certain conditions.
The value of the Rustenburg mine and its associated mineral rights is expected to be recovered principally through sale.
A pre-tax impairment charge of $728 million $537million after tax hasbeen recorded against the carrying value of the Rustenburg assets in order to bring their carrying value into line with fair value less costs of disposal, basedupon the estimated value of the agreed sale consideration, of $0.2 billion.
This excludes any economic value generated from the future purchase ofconcentrate and toll treatment arrangements which will be recognised for accounting purposes at the time when the benefit is received.
The impairment charge has been recorded principally against property, plant and equipment, of which $452 million is against mining properties and leases, and includes an allocation of goodwill of $41 million.
Anglo American Norte On 11 September 2015, the Group completed the sale of its interest in Anglo American Norte S. A. AA Norte Copper.
The company consists of the Mantoverde and Mantos Blancos copper mines located in northern Chile.
The consideration comprises $300 million in cash plus deferred consideration up toa maximum of $200 million, contingent upon certain conditions see note 30.
At 31 December 2015 the remaining deferred contingent consideration, of up to $150 million, has been valued at nil.
Apre-tax loss on disposal of $287 million post-tax $350 million has been recorded.
Tarmac On 17 July 2015, the Group completed the sale of its 50% ownership interest in Lafarge Tarmac Corporate and other to Lafarge for cash proceeds of approximately 992 million $1,559 million, constituting the agreed minimum consideration of 885 million and approximately 107 million of working capital and other adjustments.
Inaddition, during the year the Group has disposed of the majority of its interests in Tarmac Middle East TME Corporate and other which supplies aggregates, asphalt androad base contracting services to the Middle East construction industry.
The sale of a further interest in TME was completed in January 2016.
Disposal of the one remaining TME interest is well advanced.
A loss of$172 million also $172 million after tax has been recognised on disposal of the Tarmac businesses.
2014 Non-operating special items in 2014 principally relate to closure provisions and asset write downs in relation to Drayton and Drayton South Coal, charges arising on the revaluation of deferred contingent consideration for the disposal of Amap Corporate and other, the refinancing of Ponahalo Investments RF Proprietary Limited, a Black Economic Empowerment partner fide Beers, and a net gain on the refinancing transaction for Atlatsa Platinum.
Financing special items and remeasurements Financing special items and remeasurements reflect a net gain of $615 million 2014: $36 million.
The associated tax is a credit of $54 million 2014: charge of $36 million.
This principally relates to a debit valuation adjustment onderivative liabilities hedging net debt of $555 million.
This adjustment is incorporated into the valuation of these derivatives to reflect the impact on the fair value of AngloAmericans own credit quality.
The net gain reflects an increase in observed credit spreads for Anglo American, see note 18 for further detail.
Tax associated with special items and remeasurements Total tax relating to subsidiaries and joint operations amounts to a credit of $47 million 2014: $2 million.
This includes one-off tax charges of $829 million 2014: $105 million, tax credits on special items and remeasurements of $769 million 2014: $412 million and tax remeasurement credits of $107 million 2014: charges of $305 million.
One-off tax charges of $829 million primarily comprise the write down of deferred tax assets at Minas-Rio of $404 million, Kumba Iron Ore of $65 million, Coalof $175 million, fide Beers Canada of $61 million and Corporate of $83 million, where it is no longer considered probable that these assets can be recovered against future taxable profits.
Of the total tax credit of $47 million, $55 million relates to a current tax charge 2014: credit of $31 million and $102 million relates to a deferred tax credit 2014:charge of $29million.

See note 6 for further details of the tax amounts included within special items and remeasurements.
IAS 1 requires income from associates and joint ventures to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement.
Associates and joint ventures tax is therefore excluded from the Groups income tax expense.
Associates and joint ventures tax included within Share of net loss income from associates and joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2015 is $143million 2014:$159million.
Excluding special items and remeasurements this becomes $100million 2014: $113 million.
The effective tax rate before special items and remeasurements including attributable share of associates and joint ventures tax for the year ended 31December 2015 was 31.0%.
This is higher than the equivalent effective tax rate of 29.8% for the year ended 31 December 2014 due to the net impact of certain prior year adjustments, the remeasurement of withholding tax provisions across the Group, and the relative levels of profits arising in the Groups operating jurisdictions.
In future periods it is expected that the effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.

The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company Headline earnings Underlying earnings 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Loss earnings US$ million Basic and diluted loss earnings 5,624 2,513 369 1,535 827 2,217 Number of shares million Basic number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,289 1,284 1,289 1,284 1,289 1,284 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options and awards 3 5 3 5 Diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,289 1,284 1,292 1,289 1,292 1,289 Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
Basic loss per share is equal to diluted loss per share as all 12,855,264 2014: 18,431,061 potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive.
8,996,586 2014:178,808 shares have been excluded from the calculation of diluted headline earnings per share and diluted underlying earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, based on headline and underlying earnings, uses the following earnings data: US$ million 2015 2014 Loss for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 5,624 2,513 Operating special items 5,899 4,268 Operating special items tax 489 362 Operating special items non-controlling interests 413 16 Non-operating special items 1,181 218 Non-operating special items tax 127 51 Non-operating special items non-controlling interests 58 9 Headline earnings for the financial year 369 1,535 1 Operating special items 299 106 Operating remeasurements 178 1 2 Non-operating special items 97 167 Financing special items and remeasurements 615 36 Tax special items 829 105 Special items and remeasurements tax 217 352 Non-controlling interests on special items and remeasurements 113 13 Underlying earnings for the financial year 827 2,217 1 Includes restructuring costs 2014: restructuring costs.

3 Includes goodwill of $52 million allocated to Snap Lake fide Beers which has been written off as the operation has been placed on care and maintenance, and goodwill of $41 million allocated to Rustenburg Platinum which has been written down to fair value.
See note 6 for further details.
Impairment tests for goodwill See note 39f for the Groups accounting policy on impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units CGUs or groups of CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
This allocation largely represents the Groups segments.
The allocation of goodwill to CGUs or groups ofCGUs is as follows: US$ million 2015 2014 Platinum 189 230 fide Beers 1,553 1,895 Copper 124 124 Coal South Africa 88 88 Other 216 216 2,170 2,553 For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs has been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal basis.
The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 1.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

The write-down of inventories net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases amounted to $121 million 2014: $153 million.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short term in nature and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of receivables relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 39a, net of appropriate provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such provisions are raised based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer circumstances.
2015 2014 Due within Due after Due within Due after US$ million one year one year Total one year one year Total Trade receivables 1,355 135 1,490 1,807 161 1,968 Tax receivables 271 238 509 383 253 636 Prepayments 105 23 128 157 58 215 Other receivables 252 143 395 221 273 494 1,983 539 2,522 2,568 745 3,313 Of the year end trade receivables balance, $55 million 2014: $61 million were past due at 31 December, stated after an associated impairment provision of$18 million 2014: $30million.
The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Groups businesses operate.
Given this, theuse of payment security instruments including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions, and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts areconsidered recoverable.
The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade payables are not interest bearing and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of payables relating to purchases of provisionally priced concentrate which are marked to market using the appropriate forward price until settled.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS See notes 39l, 39m and 39n for the Groups accounting policies on impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are as shown below.
Where the carrying amount of a financial asset or liability does not approximate its fair value, this is also disclosed.
For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value.
For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.

Trade and other payables exclude tax and social security and deferred income.
2 Derivative instruments are analysed between those which are Held for trading and those designated into hedge relationships in note 19.
3 Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt which is held at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the hedged risk for example interest rate risk.
The fair value of these borrowings is $10,898 million 2014: $15,339 million, which is based on the quoted market price andconsequently categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the remaining borrowings at amortised cost of $3,167 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, is $2,463 million as at 31 December 2015, with the difference between the carrying value andthe fair value reflecting primarily the debit valuation adjustment to reflect the effect of Anglo Americans own credit quality based on observed credit spreads at the balance sheet date.
At31December 2014 the carrying value of borrowings at amortised cost of $3,487 million was considered to approximate the fair value.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value hierarchy An analysis of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value is set out below: 2015 2014 1 2 3 1 2 3 US$ million Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets At fair value through profit and loss Provisionally priced trade receivables 562 562 812 812 Other receivables 70 70 100 100 Derivatives hedging net debt 628 17 645 51 59 110 Other derivatives 9 18 27 1 42 43 Designated into hedges Derivatives hedging net debt 477 477 979 979 Other derivatives 1 1 Available for sale investments Financial asset investments 162 22 184 457 48 505 171 1,685 109 1,965 459 1,884 207 2,550 Financial liabilities At fair value through profit and loss Provisionally priced trade payables 225 225 314 314 Derivatives hedging net debt 2,207 736 2,943 1,647 499 2,146 Other derivatives 63 63 2 129 131 Designated into hedges Derivatives hedging net debt 17 17 27 27 Other derivatives 7 7 20 20 Debit valuation adjustment to derivative 4 liabilities 386 181 567 2,133 555 2,688 2 2,137 499 2,638 Net assets liabilities carried at fair value 171 448 446 723 457 253 292 88 1 Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
This category includes listed equity shares.
2 Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect onthe valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
4 The debit valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect in the fair value of financial liabilities the effect of Anglo Americans own credit quality based on observed credit spreads.
This adjustment iscalculated in total for each counterparty based on the net expected exposure.
In many cases this includes exposures on a number of different types of derivative instruments.
Consequently the impact of this adjustment has been presented as a separate item within the analysis of derivatives above.
Based on an allocation weighted by exposure to each category of instrument, $555million is attributable to derivatives hedging net debt and $12 million relates to other derivatives.
The impact of this adjustment at 31 December 2014 was insignificant and consequently noadjustment has been made to the prior year presentation.
Financial assets and liabilities included within level 3 primarily consist of certain cross currency swaps of Brazilian real denominated borrowings whose valuation depends upon regulated interest rates, contingent proceeds and related receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows: Assets Liabilities US$ million 2015 2014 2015 2014 At 1 January 207 225 499 456 1 Net loss recorded in the income statement 75 7 90 43 Net loss recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 15 6 Settlement 34 Currency movements 8 5 At 31 December 109 207 555 499 1 This is principally recorded in special items and remeasurements.
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain estimated inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015 137 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 19.
DERIVATIVES See note 39n for the Groups accounting policy on derivatives.
The fair values of derivatives are separately recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the contracted maturity of the derivative.
The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.
Such derivatives are classified as Held for trading and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Cash flow hedges In certain cases the Group classifies its forward foreign currency contracts, which hedge highly probable forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges.
Where this designation is documented, changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the Consolidated income statement or hedged balance sheet item.
Fair value hedges The majority of interest rate swaps taken out to swap the Groups fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Groups policy have been designated as fair value hedges.
The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Net investment hedges In certain instances, the Group uses derivative instruments to hedge exposures in non-US dollar functional subsidiaries to exchange rate fluctuations on USdollar denominated borrowings.
Such derivatives may be designated as net investment hedges and at 31 December 2014 principally related to the Groups Australian coal operations.
Fair value changes in these derivatives are recognised within the Cumulative translation adjustment reserve and recycled upon disposal of the related subsidiary.
Held for trading The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges.
This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt.
Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements and are classified as financing or operating depending on the nature of the associated hedged risk.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value.
The fair value of the Groups open derivative positions at 31 December excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet, recorded within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities, is as follows: Current Non-current 2015 2014 2015 2014 US$ million Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Derivatives hedging net debt 1 Fair value hedge Interest rate swaps 23 15 454 18 617 27 Net investment hedge Forward foreign currency contracts 347 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 628 10 51 10 Cross currency swaps 14 430 38 386 3 2,502 21 1,750 Other Debit valuation adjustment to derivative 2 liabilities 19 536 665 421 104 396 457 1,984 985 1,777 3 Other derivatives 24 56 43 143 3 2 1 8 Total derivatives 689 477 147 539 460 1,986 986 1,785 1 Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a loss on fair value hedged items of $143 million 2014: $440 million, offset by a gain on fair value hedging instruments of $146million 2014: $381 million.
2 Relates to cross currency swaps.
3 Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure that are accounted for as Held for trading.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at 31 December, at market prices and rates available at the time.
The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
For more information about these risks and the ways in which the Group manages them see notes 24 and 38.

A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs, based on managements best estimate of the legal and constructive obligations incurred.
These estimates reflect industry best practice and currently applicable legislation.
Significant changes in legislation could result in changes in provisions recognised.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Decommissioning Provision is made for the present value of costs relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site restoration work.
Employee benefits Provision is made for statutory or contractual employee entitlements including long service leave, annual leave, sickness pay and similar obligations.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred when employees choose to take their benefits.
Onerous contracts Provision is made for the present value of certain long term contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the Groups obligations is expected to exceed the benefits to be received.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period of up to 15 years.
Other Other provisions primarily relate to restructuring costs, indemnities, legal and other claims.
It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a five yearperiod.
Environmental rehabilitation trusts The Group makes contributions to controlled funds that were established to meet the cost of some of its restoration and environmental rehabilitation liabilities, primarily in South Africa.

NET DEBT See note 39o for the Groups accounting policy on cash and debt.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups financial position.
The Group uses net debt to monitor the sources and uses of financial resources, the availability of capital to invest or return to shareholders, and the resilience of the balance sheet.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt, see note 19. a Reconciliation to the balance sheet Medium and Cash and cash equivalents Short term borrowings long term borrowings US$ million 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Balance sheet 6,895 6,748 1,649 1,618 16,318 16,917 Balance sheet disposal groups 9 Bank overdrafts 15 1 15 1 Net cash debt classifications 6,889 6,747 1,634 1,617 16,318 16,917 b Movement in net debt Cash Medium and Net debt Derivatives Net debt and cash Short term long term excluding hedging including 1 US$ million equivalents borrowings borrowings derivatives net debt derivatives At 1 January 2014 7,702 2,106 15,740 10,144 508 10,652 Cash flow 841 1,785 3,568 2,624 203 2,827 Reclassifications 1,487 1,487 Movement in fair value 7 434 441 373 814 Other non-cash movements 2 72 74 74 Currency movements 114 200 1,410 1,496 1,496 At 31 December 2014 6,747 1,617 16,917 11,787 1,084 12,871 Cash flow 416 1,404 2,736 916 170 746 Reclassifications 1,616 1,616 Movement in fair value 9 151 142 924 782 Other non-cash movements 2 45 47 47 Currency movements 274 206 1,613 1,545 1,545 At 31 December 2015 6,889 1,634 16,318 11,063 1,838 12,901 1 Derivatives hedging net debt represents the mark to market valuation of such derivatives before taking into account the effect of debit valuation adjustments which reduce the valuation of derivative liabilities hedging net debt by $555 million 2014: nil.
Further details on this adjustment are provided in note 18. c Net debt by segment The Groups policy is to hold the majority of its cash and borrowings at the corporate centre.
Business units may from time to time raise borrowings in connection with specific capital projects, and subsidiaries with non-controlling interests have borrowings which are without recourse to the Group.
Other than the impact of South African exchange controls see 23d below, there are no significant restrictions over the Groups ability to access these cash balances or repay these borrowings.
Net cash debt by segment is stated after elimination of inter-segment balances.

BORROWINGS See note 39o for the Groups accounting policy on bank borrowings.
The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme, the South African Domestic Medium Term Note DMTN programme, the Australian Medium Term Note AMTN programme and through accessing the United States US bond markets.
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Groups borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
During 2015, the Group issued corporate bonds with a US dollar equivalent value of $2.2 billion.
These included the following bonds: 600 million 1.5% guaranteed loan notes due 2020 issued under the EMTN programme.
$850 million 3.625% senior notes due 2020 and $650 million 4.875% senior notes due 2025 through accessing the US bond markets.
Related to these assets are borrowings of $19 million 2014: $30 million.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015 143 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CASH FLOW STATEMENT, NET DEBT AND RELATED NOTES 24.
BORROWINGS continued Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.

Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and, with cognisance of forecast future market conditions and structuring, to maintain an optimal capital structure to enable the business to operate effectively.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group has a number of options including raising and refinancing debt, adjusting returns to equity shareholders, managing the allocation of capital and divesting non-core assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital using various financial metrics including the ratio of net debt to total capital gearing.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt.
Total capital is calculated as Net assets as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet excluding net debt.
Total capital and gearing are as follows: US$ million 2015 2014 Net assets 21,342 32,177 Net debt including related derivatives note 23 12,901 12,871 Total capital 34,243 45,048 Gearing 37.7% 28.6% Gearing has increased from 28.6% to 37.7% as total capital has decreased.
Net debt remained consistent at $12.9 billion at 31December 2015 as cash inflows from operating activities were offset by outflows primarily relating to capital expenditure and dividends to Anglo American plc shareholders as well as to non-controlling interests.
Total capital decreased from $45.0 billion to $34.2 billion primarily due to the impact of impairments and the effect of a stronger USdollar on assets denominated in other currencies.

BORROWINGS continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values and related cash flows will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
The Group manages interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks on borrowings and cash with the use of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in order to ensure that the majority of borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
The Group does not hedge foreign exchange exposures on rand denominated borrowings in South Africa.
For more information regarding the Groups financial risk management see note 38.

COMMITMENTS See note 39x for the Groups accounting policy on leases.
A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future which is not provided for in the balance sheet.
The Group also has purchase obligations relating to take or pay agreements which are legally binding and enforceable.
Capital commitments for subsidiaries and joint operations relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment is $1,168 million 2014: $1,936 million, of which 82% 2014: 80% relates to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS See note 39t for the Groups accounting policy on retirement benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
It also operates post employment medical plans, principally inSouth Africa.
Defined contribution plans The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans net of amounts capitalised was $221million 2014: $244 million and for defined contribution medical plans net of amounts capitalised was $73million 2014: $81 million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans The Group operates defined benefit pension and medical plans across a number of regions.
The most significant plans are in South Africa and the UnitedKingdom.
A summary of the movements in the net pension plan assets and retirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows: US$ million 2015 2014 Net liability recognised at 1 January 889 1,013 Net income statement charge 60 113 Remeasurement of net defined benefit obligation 290 15 Employer contributions to funded pension plans 118 132 Benefits paid to unfunded plans 24 15 Disposal of business 41 Other 12 16 Currency movements 103 89 Net liability recognised at 31 December 361 889 Amounts recognised as: 1 Defined benefit pension plans in surplus 306 184 Retirement benefit obligation pension plans 330 615 Retirement benefit obligation medical plans 337 458 361 889 1 Included in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation totermination indemnity plans in Chile.
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded and are principally in South Africa.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2015.
Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.
While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, achange in the assumptions used would impact the Groups other comprehensive income.
Characteristics and risks of plans The defined benefit plans are exposed to risks such as longevity, investment risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchangerisk.
The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 11 years 2014: 12 years, United Kingdom plans is 18years 2014: 18 years and plans in other regions is 14 years 2014: 14 years.
This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.
Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year.
Employer contributions made to funded plans inthe year ended 31December 2015 were $118million.
In addition $24 million of benefits were paid to unfunded plans and $23 million of benefits were paid in relation topost employment medical plans.
The Group expects to contribute $118 million toits pension plans and $20million to its post employment medical plans in2016.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.
South Africa The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus, with the asset recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus Account, being plan assets less plan liabilities less any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds actuaries.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of refund.
All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability.
United Kingdom The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom.
These plans are closed to new members and to the future accrual of benefits.
Certain assets held by the main plans in the United Kingdom are structured to closely match the characteristics of the liabilities through a variety of investment strategies, including the use of interest rate hedging and inflation hedging to manage interest rate risk and inflation rate risk, respectively.
The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.
Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plans as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any resulting surplus has been assessed to be fully recoverable and as such no provision has been recognised.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015 147 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION 27.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Other Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.
The features of this provision meet the definition of a post employment benefit obligation and consequently an unfunded liability is recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet.
Other plans are in Brazil, Canada and mainland Europe and consist of funded and unfunded pension plans and unfunded medical aid plans.
These plans are not considered to be significant tothe Group.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension charges and credits are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2015 2014 South United South United Africa Kingdom Other Africa Kingdom Other Defined benefit pension plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 10.3% 3.9% 6.8% 8.3% 3.6% 6.4% Average rate of inflation 7.9% 3.1% 3.6% 6.2% 3.1% 3.5% Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 7.9% 3.1% 3.2% 6.2% 3.2% 3.2% Post employment medical plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 10.3% 3.9% 9.1% 8.3% 3.9% 7.0% Average rate of inflation 7.9% 3.1% 6.9% 6.2% 3.3% 5.2% Expected average increase in healthcare costs 9.6% 7.8% 9.1% 7.9% 8.0% 7.7% Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.
In South Africa, the PA90 tables are used.
The main plans in the United Kingdom use either SAPS tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based onmortality investigations.
Themortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2015 2014 2015 2014 South Africa 19.8 19.9 24.5 24.6 United Kingdom 28.2 28.7 30.0 30.2 Other 22.8 22.8 27.2 27.1 The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female aged 45 at the balance sheet date.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS See note 39u for the Groups accounting policy on share-based payments.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group had share-based payment arrangements with employees relating to shares of the Company, the details of which are described in the Remuneration report.
All of these Company schemes are equity settled, either by award of ordinary shares BSP, LTIP and SIP or award of options to acquire ordinary shares ESOS, DOP and SAYE.
The ESOS is now closed to new participants, having been replaced with the BSP, and there have been no outstanding awards since 31 December 2014.
Nooptions have been granted under theDOP.
The total share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares for the year is split as follows: US$ million 2015 2014 BSP 88 94 LTIP 42 60 Other schemes 5 3 1 Share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares 135 157 1 In addition, there are equity settled share-based payment charges of $47 million 2014: $58 million relating to Kumba Iron Ore Limited shares and $26 million 2014: $35 million relating toAnglo American Platinum Limited shares.
Certain business units also operate cash settled employee share-based payment schemes.
These schemes had a charge of $1million 2014: $8 million.
Schemes settled by award of ordinary shares The fair value of ordinary shares under the BSP, LTIP and LTIP-ROCE, being the more material schemes, was calculated using a Black Scholes model.
The fair value of shares awarded under the LTIP-TSR scheme was calculated using a Monte Carlo model.
These awards have a contractual life of three years and are conditional on three years continuous employment.
The LTIP-ROCE and LTIP-TSR awards are conditional on a Group ROCE target and market based performance conditions, respectively, being achieved.
The following assumptions were used in the valuation of the awards: expected volatility of 35% 2014:35% based on historic volatility over the last five years: risk free interest rate of 0.9% 2014: 1.1% based on the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with a term similar to the expected life of the award: expected departures rate of 5% pa 2014: 5% pa : and a dividend yield of 2.1% 2014: 2.1%.
The awards granted during the year under these assumptions are summarised below: 2015 2014 Fair value at Fair value at date of grant date of grant Number of weighted Number of weighted instruments average instruments average BSP 5,560,276 12.05 5,128,574 14.63 LTIP 2,792,470 12.05 1,934,900 14.63 LTIP-ROCE 827,674 12.05 613,682 14.63 LTIP-TSR 827,674 5.30 613,682 7.87 1 The number of instruments used in the fair value models may differ from the total number of instruments awarded in the year due to awards made subsequent to the fair value calculations.
Thefair value calculated per the assumptions above has been applied to the total number of awards.
The difference in income statement charge is not considered significant.
The charges arising in respect of the other Anglo American plc employee share schemes that the Group operated during the year are not considered material.

Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries to take transfer of the Anglo American plc shares each has purchased on the market.
Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market.
These payments by Tenon were sourced from the cash resources of AASA.
Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31 December 2025 against payment of an average amount of $3.51 per share to Epoch, $5.46 per share to Epoch Two and $4.53 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party.
These funds will then become available for redemption of the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies.
The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the Anglo American plc shares will accrue to Tenon and, as these are own shares of the Company, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares.
The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax ofEpoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.
The structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with participation in future dividend receipts.
TheInvestment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.
At 31 December 2015 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 2014: 112,300,129 Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.0% 2014:8.0% of the ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares with a market value of $498 million 2014: $2,100 million.
The Investment Companies are not permitted to hold more than an aggregate of 10% of the issued share capital of Anglo American plc at any one time.
The Investment Companies are considered to be structured entities.
Although the Group has no voting rights in the Investment Companies and cannot appoint or remove trustees of the charitable trusts, the Group considers that the agreement outlined above, including Tenons right to nominate the transferee of the Anglo American plc shares held by the Investment Companies, result in the Group having control over the Investment Companies as defined under IFRS 10.
Accordingly, the Investment Companies are required to be consolidated by the Group.

Anglo American South Africa Limited AASA AASA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in South Africa on behalf of former mineworkers or their dependants or survivors who allegedly contracted silicosis working for gold mining companies in which AASA was a shareholder and to which AASA provided various technical and administrative services.
The law suits in South Africa against AASA are: i Approximately 4,400 separate lawsuits filed in the North Gauteng High Court Pretoria which have been referred to arbitration: and ii A consolidated class certification application filed in the South Gauteng High Court Johannesburg in which AASA is named asone of 32 defendants.
AASA is defending the separate lawsuits and is opposing the application for consolidated class certification.
AASA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold and Sibanye Gold announced in November 2014 that they had formed an industry working group to address issues relating to compensation and medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold mining industry in South Africa.
The companies are in theprocess of engaging all stakeholders on these matters, including government, organised labour, other mining companies and legal representatives of claimants who have filed legal suits against the companies.
These legal proceedings are being defended.
The industry working group is seeking a comprehensive solution to address legacy compensation issues and future legal frameworks that is fair to past and current employees and enables companies to continue to be competitive over the long term.
Kumba Iron Ore 21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mine mineral rights In December 2013 the Constitutional Court ruled that Sishen Iron Ore Company SIOC held a 78.6% undivided share of the Sishen mining right and that, based on the provisions of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act MPRDA, only SIOC can apply for, and be granted, the residual 21.4% share of the mining right at the Sishen mine.
The grant of the mining right may be made subject to such conditions considered by the Minister of Mineral Resources the Minister to be appropriate.
SIOC applied for the residual right in early 2014.
SIOC received notice from the Department of Mineral Resources DMR that the Director General of the DMR had consented to the amendment of SIOCs mining right in respect of the Sishen mine to include the residual 21.4% undivided share of the mining right for the Sishen mine.
The consent letter is subject to certain conditions which are described by the DMR as proposals.
The conditions contained in the Letter of Grant relate substantively to domestic supply, support for skills development, research and development, and procurement.
Until the legal and practical implications of the proposed conditions have been clarified with the DMR, SIOC is unable to accept the conditions.
Section 96 of the MPRDA allows for an internal appeal to the Minister.
SIOC therefore submitted an internal appeal to the Minister, as required by the MPRDA.
SIOC has not yet received a response to its appeal.
In the interim, SIOC continues to engage with the DMR in relation to the proposed conditions in order to achieve a mutually beneficial solution.
Kumba Iron Ore tax At 31 December 2015, Kumba Iron Ore has certain unresolved tax matters that are currently under review with the South African Revenue Service SARS.
Kumba Iron Ore management has consulted with external tax and legal advisers, who support the positions taken.
Nonetheless, Kumba Iron Ore management is actively discussing the issue with SARS with a view to seeking resolution and believes that the accounting for these matters is appropriate in the results for the year ended 31 December 2015.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting structures.
The risk management processes of the Groups independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Groups own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31December is as follows subcategorised into credit risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Market risks a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay for its obligation.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows: US$ million 2015 2014 Cash and cash equivalents 6,895 6,748 1 Trade and other receivables 1,885 2,465 2 Financial asset investments 662 761 Derivative financial assets 1,149 1,133 10,591 11,107 1 Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables.
2 Financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions approved by the Board.
Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity in case of relationship banks and fund size in case of asset managers.
Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, and the use of payment security instruments including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in note 16.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015 157 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 38.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued b Commodity price risk The Groups earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons.
In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Groups sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows: 2015 2014 Commodity price linked Commodity price linked Not Not Subject to linked to Subject to linked to price Fixed commodity price Fixed commodity 1 2 1 2 US$ million movements price price Total movements price price Total Total net financial instruments excluding derivatives 337 334 11,674 11,003 498 649 12,590 11,443 Derivatives 16 1,330 1,314 3 1,194 1,191 353 334 13,004 12,317 501 649 13,784 12,634 1 Includes provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.
2 Includes receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
Commodity based contracts that are settled through physical delivery of the Groups production or are used within the production process are classified as normal purchase or sale contracts and are not marked to market.
c Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.
The Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Groups underlying earnings.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Analysis of foreign exchange risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24.
Net otherfinancial assets excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt are $593 million.
This includes net assets of $920 million denominated in US dollars and $92 million denominated in Brazilian real, and net liabilities of $231 million denominated in Australian dollars, $217 million denominated in Chilean pesos and $191 million denominated in South African rand.
d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities.
The Group is principally exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Groups policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt.
Strategic hedging using fixed rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24.
Net other financial assets excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt of $593 million, are primarily non-interest bearing.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued e Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December to changes in foreign currencies, commodity prices and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December.
In addition, the commodity price impact for provisionally priced contracts is based on the related trade receivables and trade payables at 31 December.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at 31 December.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: all income statement sensitivities also impact equity for debt and other deposits carried at amortised cost, carrying value does not change as interest rates move no sensitivity is provided for interest accruals as these are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate changes no sensitivity has been calculated on derivatives and related underlying instruments designated into fair value hedge relationships as these are assumed materially to offset one another all hedge relationships are assumed to be fully effective debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate, unless it is a long term fixed rate debt in its final year translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant commodity price.
2015 2014 US$ million Income Equity Income Equity 1 Foreign currency sensitivities 10% US dollar to rand 19 19 13 13 10% US dollar to rand 19 19 13 13 2 10% US dollar to Brazilian real 46 46 154 154 2 10% US dollar to Brazilian real 46 46 154 154 10% US dollar to Australian dollar 9 9 30 30 10% US dollar to Australian dollar 9 9 30 30 10% US dollar to Chilean peso 21 21 36 36 10% US dollar to Chilean peso 24 24 40 40 Commodity price sensitivities 10% increase in the copper price 117 117 103 103 10% decrease in the copper price 117 117 103 103 10% increase in the platinum group metals price 13 13 21 21 10% decrease in the platinum group metals price 13 13 21 21 Interest rate sensitivity 3 50bps increase in LIBOR 32 32 33 33 3 50bps decrease in LIBOR 32 32 33 33 1 represents strengthening of US dollar against the respective currency.
2 Includes sensitivities for derivatives related to capital expenditure.
3 Without the impact of capitalised interest, the Groups sensitivity to a 50bps increase and decrease in LIBOR would be $61 million 2014: $49 million loss and gain respectively.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including: fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year fluctuating cash balances changes in currency mix.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances, they do not take account of the Groups sales and operating costs, which are highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates.
In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation whilst, in reality, commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
