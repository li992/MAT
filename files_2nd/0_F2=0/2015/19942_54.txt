Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based onnormal operating capacity.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Further details on inventory valuation and provisions areincluded in note 20.

Financial risk management Group Currency risk Currently, the Group exports 97% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
Currency risk is managed by the Currency Committee, which is chaired by the Group Finance Director and comprises the Chief Executive and senior finance executives.
It meets monthly to review and manage the Groups currency hedging activities, in line with the hedging policy approved by the Board.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging: a minimum of 90% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising from trading in the u forthcoming six month period: and a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising in the following six month period.
u Profitability can vary due to the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the unhedged portion of the transaction exposures and from revised forecasts of future trading, which can lead to an adjustment of currency cover in place.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2015 is 5.8m, 3.7m and 0.7m 2014: 5.5m, 4.2m and 0.7m respectively.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on equity for 2015 is 2.9m, 0.5m and 0.4m 2014: 2.4m, 0.6m and 0.4m respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, theGroup does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether thederivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group alsodocuments its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the incomestatement.

Financial risk management continued Cash flow hedges The Group hedges a proportion of forecast sales, purchases and capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency.
The Board is responsible for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 86.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less thanone year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or ahighlyprobable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating totheineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time when the forecast transaction occurs, or when a hedge no longer meets thecriteria for hedge accounting, is recognised in the income statement.
The timing of the gain or loss impacting the income statement isaligned to the timing of the hedged transaction impacting the income statement.
When a forecast transaction isno longer expected tooccur, thecumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity isimmediately transferred to the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps areas follows: As at 30 September 2015 As at 30 September 2014 Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Current assets 22.2 2.0 106.9 4.0 Current liabilities 161.1 4.4 65.6 2.3 183.3 2.4 172.5 1.7 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
These are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The following table indicates the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts forwhich hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: As at 30 September 2015 As at 30 September 2014 Expected Expected cash 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 flows or less months months flows or less months months m m m m m m m m Forward exchange contracts: Assets 22.2 14.9 6.5 0.8 106.9 62.6 43.5 0.8 Liabilities 161.1 83.5 68.8 8.8 65.6 27.1 31.6 6.9 183.3 98.4 75.3 9.6 172.5 89.7 75.1 7.7 Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2015 will be recognised inthe income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is typically 12 months prior to the cash flow occurring.
At 30 September 2015, there are a number ofhedged foreign currency transactions which are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
Duringthe year, losses of 0.4m 2014: gains of 0.6m relating to forward exchange contracts on the balancesheet at30 September 2015 were released tothe income statement.
Gains and losses recognised in the income statement on contracts which are yet to settle are adjusted as a non-cash movement on the cash flow statements.
This equated to a loss of 1.0m in the year 2014: 0.1m gain.
Credit risk The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Executive Leadership Team approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration ofcredit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
All customers are assigned a credit limit which is subject toannual review.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk continued Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 As at 30 September m m Amounts neither past due nor impaired 21.4 23.4 Amounts past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days 2.9 2.5 3060 days 0.9 0.4 More than 60 days 0.1 0.1 Total past due but not impaired 3.9 3.0 Amounts impaired 0.5 0.5 Impairment allowances 0.5 0.5 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 25.3 26.4 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2015 2014 m m At beginning of year 0.5 0.6 Charge in the year Release of allowance 0.1 At end of year 0.5 0.5 The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established international banks whose credit ratings are monitored onanongoing basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term deposits with original maturities typically of three months or less.
As at 30 September 2015, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 14.3m 2014: 24.8m for the Group.
As at 30September 2015, the largest mark to market exposure for gains on forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 1.0m 2014: 2.0m.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has acommitted bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility expires in September 2017.
As at 30 September 2015, the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 53.8m.
Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree ofcontrol over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
The Groups policy for managing capital is tomaintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group hassufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth ofthe business.
The Board does not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2016, although there is a resolution proposed at each AGM to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number ofshares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM notice.
