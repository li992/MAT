I II III: Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2016 2015 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 24 February 2016.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 2 January 2015 2014.
For the 52 week period ended 1 January 2016 and previous periods, the Group has reported its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
For practical purposes, a decision has been made to alter the reporting basis to reflect a calendar year, with the next annual reporting date being 31 December 2016 and the interim financial period end being 30 June 2016.
This is not expected to significantly impact the reported results in 2016.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in Sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except where otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous period except for the adoption of the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle, which was implemented effective from 1 January 2015.
This covered minor clarifications and amendments to various IFRSs and did not have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
There are no other standards and amendments which apply for the first time in 2015 and impact the Group financial statements.
Business combinations update to provisional fair values During the year, the provisional fair values attributed to the 2014 acquisitions being Trio and Metra were finalised.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the net impact of the adjustments to the provisional fair values has been recognised by means of an increase to goodwill and the adjustments to the provisional amounts have been recognised as if the accounting for the business combinations had been completed at the relevant acquisition dates.
As such, all affected balances and amounts have been restated in the financial statements.
The table below reflects the adjustments made to finalise the Trio Engineered Products Weir Trio fair values.
Provisional Final fair fair values values 2 January 2 January Adjustments 2015 2015 to fair values m m m Inventories 20.9 19.9 1.0 Trade & other receivables 15.6 13.6 2.0 Trade & other payables 20.0 20.6 0.6 Provisions 10.9 11.2 0.3 Deferred tax 1.0 0.7 1.7 Goodwill arising on acquisition 75.7 77.9 2.2 Impact on net assets The Metra Equipment Inc. Weir Metra provisional fair values were also finalised during the period, the impact being a decrease to the inventory fair value of 0.3m, with a corresponding increase in goodwill.
The Consolidated Balance Sheet and affected notes present restated comparative information as at 2 January 2015.
There was no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement or Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a result of the finalisation of the provisional fair values.
Exceptional items In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, profit for each financial period has been analysed between: i profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items may include but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on disposal or closure of businesses: the cost of significant business restructuring: significant impairments of intangible or tangible assets: adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related items such as contingent consideration and inventory: other items deemed exceptional due to their significance, size or nature: and the related exceptional taxation.
The Weir Group PLC 135 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Exceptional items continued Intangibles amortisation has been shown separately to provide visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
Use of estimates & judgements The Groups significant accounting policies are set out below.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Management base these judgements, estimates and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance.
Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgements and assumptions, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas where management consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions are required are those in respect of acquired assets and liabilities business combinations note 13, exceptional items above and note 5, retirement benefits note 24, taxation note 7, valuation of inventory note 16, provisions note 22, impairment of non-current assets note 14 and legal claims note 27.
Further commentary on areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is provided in the Financial Review on pages 48 to 49.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Groups share of results of its joint ventures.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
A full list of the Companys subsidiary undertakings can be found on pages 201 to 204.
Joint ventures The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment over the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
The Weir Group PLC 136 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before that date.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on despatch of goods, and reliable measurement is possible.
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs, or the possible return of goods.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale.
Where the sale of product requires customer inspection, revenue is not recognised until the inspection has been completed and approved by the customer.
This policy is applicable to the sale of both original equipment and spare parts, whether sold individually, in bulk or as part of a cross-selling marketing strategy.
Provision of services Revenue from the rendering of services is generally recognised on completion if the service contract is short-term in nature.
Where this is not the case, revenue from services is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the service at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the contractual agreement with each separate customer and the costs incurred on the contract to date in comparison to the total forecast costs of the contract.
Revenue recognition commences only when the outcome of the contract can be reliably measured, by reference to individual terms and conditions within each service contract, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Group.
Otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
Construction contracts Construction contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Construction contracts are primarily entered into by the Groups Engineer to Order businesses.
Property, plant & equipment The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the transition to IFRS.
Property, plant & equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant & equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings 10 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings duration of lease Plant & equipment 3 20 years Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
The Weir Group PLC 137 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Goodwill continued Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Any contingent consideration is recognised at the date of acquisition.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are accounted for in accordance with the relevant IFRS.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant & equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand names Indefinite life Customer & distributor relationships 5 25 years Purchased software 4 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks 6 15 years Other up to 6 years Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product or technology and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends, and has sufficient resources, to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product or technology.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
The Weir Group PLC 138 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements Financial assets & liabilities The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations, and contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, which are generally of a short-term nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash & cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to settle the liability at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates and counterparty and the Groups own credit risk.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS 39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges, as appropriate.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow or net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Weir Group PLC 139 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting continued Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The last equity settled grant under the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS was during 2013.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The changes to the LTIP which took effect in 2014 are summarised in the Directors Remuneration Policy which can be found on the Companys website, www.
The previously granted equity settled incentives under the EBS were determined as a percentage of the annual bonus and were matched by the Group with a share award that would vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided the individual continued to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continued to be employed by the Company at the date of vesting.
In addition the EBS included a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS was determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards granted.
The fair value was determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK, US and Canada and post-retirement healthcare benefits provided to certain employees in the US.
For defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in the period reflects the net interest on the net pension liability.
This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan, and hence reducing the net liability, during the period.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet amount recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Groups contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
The Weir Group PLC 140 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant & equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised: ii Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and iii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
New standards & interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.

The Weir Group PLC 141 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 3.
SEGMENT INFORMATION For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial.
These three divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating and a reportable segment under IFRS 8.
The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment is the global leader in the provision of slurry handling equipment and associated aftermarket support for abrasive high wear applications used in the mining and oil sands markets.
The Oil & Gas segment provides products and service solutions to upstream, production, transportation, refining and related industries.
The Power & Industrial segment designs and manufactures valves, pumps and turbines as well as providing specialist support services to the global power generation, industrial and oil and gas sectors.
The Chief Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items including impairments and intangibles amortisation segment result.
Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function.
The amounts provided to the Chief Executive with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS There were no disposals of core businesses during the current or prior period.
As disclosed in note 5 an exceptional gain of 1.0m was recognised in 2014 in relation to the release of unutilised tax warranty provisions relating to previous disposals.
There have been no gains and losses in relation to discontinued operations in the current period.
Earnings per share from discontinued operations were as follows.
2015 2014 pence pence Basic 0.5 Diluted 0.5 These earnings per share figures were derived by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company from discontinued operations by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, for both basic and diluted amounts, shown in note 9.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the effect of dilutive share awards.
The following reflects the earnings and share data used in the calculation of earnings per share.

BUSIN E S S C O M B IN A T IO N S On 8 July 2015, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the voting shares of Delta Industrial Valves Inc, Delta Valves for a consideration of up to US$46m.
Delta Valves is a US-based manufacturer of knife gate valves for the mining, oil sands and other industrial markets.
The acquisition extends Weir Minerals leading presence in mining and oil sands markets by expanding the divisions portfolio of valve products, particularly knife gate valves, for use in the transportation of slurry.
Initial consideration of US$36m was paid on completion: US$21m in cash, funded from existing bank facilities, and US$15m in new equity.
The new equity represents 593,934 ordinary shares with a fair value representing the closing share price on the date of acquisition.
Up to a further US$10m in cash is payable over the 18 months from acquisition, contingent upon meeting certain profit growth targets.
The provisional fair value of the net assets has been assessed as 11.8m, giving rise to goodwill on acquisition of 14.8m.
The goodwill recognised includes certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature, including anticipated business growth, synergies and an assembled workforce.
The provisional fair values are subject to change following completion of the fair value exercise during the first half of 2016.
In March 2015, the Group completed the acquisition of the remaining 49% of Trio Chile, a minor joint venture acquired as part of the Weir Trio acquisition in 2014.
The cash consideration paid of 0.4m was offset by cash and cash equivalents acquired.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities of the entity was nil, resulting in 0.4m goodwill being recognised.

Delta Valves cash paid 15.2 cash & cash equivalents acquired 1.1 Weir Trio Chile cash paid 0.4 cash & cash equivalents acquired 0.4 Total cash outflow note 26 14.1 The gross amount and fair value of the Delta Valves trade receivables amounts to 2.6m.
It is expected that virtually all the contractual amounts will be collected.
Delta Valves contributed 10.3m to revenue and 1.1m to operating profit including exceptional items and intangibles amortisation in the period from acquisition to 1 January 2016.
If the acquisitions had occurred at the start of 2015 the revenue and profit for the period from acquired operations after exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, would not have been materially different from the results disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The fair values for Weir Trio were finalised during the year.
The cash flows in relation to this acquisition are disclosed in note 26.
Contingent consideration The acquisition of Delta Valves included a potential earn out of US$10m based on EBITDA targets in 2015 and 2016.
Based on forecast information available at the date of acquisition, a liability of US$5m 3.2m was recognised as contingent consideration.
There has been no change in this view since the date of acquisition.
While the contingent consideration liability for Delta Valves is due for final assessment in 2017, the period over which amounts recorded are expected to fall due is within one year from the balance sheet date, and as a result the provision has not been discounted.
The purchase price of Weir Trio included US$14.7m in respect of contingent consideration payable on the recovery of certain working capital balances and the achievement of agreed management goals over the 2 years following the acquisition.
Expectations at the date of acquisition were that the full amount would be payable and a discounted liability of 8.2m was recognised.
There has been no change in this view since the acquisition, with the unwind of the discount being recognised in the income statement in the period.
The discount rate applied in the fair value calculation for Weir Trio was 13.2%.
The contingent consideration liability for Weir Trio is due for final measurement in 2016.
As a result an increase decrease in the discount rate would only have a marginal impact on the fair value of the liability.
The Weir Group PLC 154 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements The acquisition of Weir International in 2011 included an earn out based on EBITDA achieved in 2013 and 2014, with further EBITDA targets extending to 2019.
In line with expectations, Weir International has met the 2013 and 2014 targets resulting in the settlement of contingent consideration, with a payment of 2.6m made in 2015.
The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration at the date of acquisition was 13.9m.
Based on trading performance the liability was reassessed during 2012 and uplifted by 5.8m.
During 2014 the fair value of the contingent consideration was uplifted by a further 0.6m following agreement with the minority shareholder over additional working capital targets applicable in 2019.
The unwind of the discount has been recognised in the income statement in the period.
A significant decrease in the EBITDA of Weir International would result in a lower fair value of the contingent consideration liability, while a significant increase decrease in the discount rate would result in a lower higher fair value of the liability.
The discount rate applied in the fair value calculation for Weir International was 12.0%.
The contingent consideration liability for Weir International is due for final measurement in 2019.
A reconciliation of fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability is provided below.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL & INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The acquisition of Delta Valves during 2015, as described in note 13, has been allocated to the Minerals CGU.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated as per the table below.
Impairment testing and sensitivity analysis The precipitous fall in the oil price over 2015, and in particular the last quarter, combined with the lower for longer outlook for the next 2 to 3 years have had a substantial impact on the short to medium term forecasts of our upstream Oil and Gas businesses.
An impairment charge of 225.5m has been recognised at the year end in relation to the Pressure Control CGU resulting in a recoverable amount of 238.4m based on the value in use.
Of the impairment 193.4m has been allocated against goodwill with the remainder of 32.1m allocated across other intangible assets on a pro rata basis.
With regard to the Pressure Pumping CGU, this business is more mature and has significant levels of headroom between net asset value and value in use remaining, despite the current prolonged market downturn.
Discounted cash flow forecasts have been prepared using consistent market assumptions as with Pressure Control with no impairment assessed.
At the balance sheet date, the estimated recoverable amount of the Pressure Control CGU is equal to its carrying value.
Consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
The Weir Group PLC 155 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 14.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL & INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES CONTINUED The following table shows the changes to assumptions used in the Pressure Control impairment model that would, in isolation, lead to an increase decrease in the impairment loss recognised in 2015.
Increase by Decrease by Increase by Decrease by 50bps 50 bps 5% 5% m m m m Discount rate 11.7 12.9 n a n a Real growth rate 9.7 8.7 n a n a Forecast revenue growth n a n a 31.1 31.1 EBIT margin 7.4 7.4 n a n a Forecast revenue growth is expressed as the percentage increase decrease in each of the initial five years used in the impairment testing.
As explained in other sections of this Annual Report but specifically in the Financial Review on page 43 and in note 5, the Group has already reacted to market conditions through the implementation of the Oil & Gas downturn actions and management continue to review the operational structure and business model to ensure we remain well placed to navigate through the current market conditions.
The cash flow forecasts underpinning the impairment testing reflect the current oil price and depressed activity levels enduring for the next two years, with pressure on both volumes and pricing, with a marginal increase in year three and a measured return to more normal levels thereafter, albeit not anticipating a return to the recent highs of 2012 for this business.
An impairment charge of 25.9m has also been recognised against goodwill held in two of the other CGUs relating to the reorganisation of the Power & Industrial Division into Weir Flow Control.
The impairment reflects the expected future cash flows of the CGUs, taking into consideration the operational restructuring within the Division.
Of this amount, 16.1m represents the impairment of goodwill in American Hydro and reflects the current cash flow forecasts of the business.
This represents value in use and the discount rate applied to the cash flows was 13.2% 2014: 12.9%.
The following table shows the changes to assumptions used in the impairment model that would, in isolation, lead to an increase decrease in the impairment loss recognised in 2015.

The remaining 9.8m reflects the impairment of goodwill within one of the other CGUs in light of the reorganisation of the Power & Industrial Division into Weir Flow Control and the decision to dispose of certain non-core renewable assets: the remaining book value of assets in that CGU are supported by the associated discounted cash flows.
For Gabbioneta, Minerals, and the businesses within the Other CGUs except for American Hydro, base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each of these CGUs to assess the impact of any reasonable possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.
Description of CGUs A description of each of the CGUs is provided below along with a summary of the key drivers of revenue growth and EBIT margin.
Pressure Pumping Pressure Pumping includes the Weir SPM, Weir Novatech and Weir Mesa brands.
Pressure Pumping is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
Demand for Pressure Pumping products and services is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were updated during the first quarter of 2016 for the continued downturn in oil price.
Pressure Control Pressure Control includes the Weir Seaboard, Weir Mathena and Weir Metra brands.
Pressure Control is a supplier of oil and gas wellhead solutions and associated rental equipment to the oil and gas production industry.
A large proportion of the business revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of conventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
The Weir Group PLC 156 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements Minerals Minerals includes the Weir Warman, Weir Linatex, Weir Multiflo, Weir Wales, Weir Trio and Weir Delta brands.
Minerals companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global mining markets.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining capital expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2015.
Delta Valves was excluded from the Group impairment test as a fair value review of goodwill and intangible assets was performed during 2015 as part of the acquisition process.
A breakdown of Delta Valves goodwill and intangible assets are disclosed in note 13.
Gabbioneta Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Other The amounts included in Other relate to individual businesses which are not considered individually significant.
Impairment testing assumptions The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that these might be impaired.
The basis of the impairment tests for the four primary CGUs including key assumptions are set out in the table below.
Basis of Period of 1 2 CGU valuation forecast Discount rate Real growth Key assumptions Source Revenue growth External forecast Pressure Pumping Value in use 5 years 13.2% 2014: 12.9% 1.2% 2014: 1.5% EBIT margins Historic experience Revenue growth External forecast Pressure Control Value in use 5 years 13.2% 2014: 12.9% 1.2% 2014: 1.5% EBIT margins Historic experience Revenue growth External forecast Gabbioneta Value in use 5 years 12.0% 2014: 11.8% 1.2% 2014: 1.5% EBIT margins Historic experience Revenue growth External forecast Minerals Value in use 5 years 15.4% 2014: 13.7% 1.2% 2014: 1.5% EBIT margins Historic experience 1 Discount rate The pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital WACC is the basis for the discount rate, with adjustments made, as appropriate, for geographic risk.
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
During the year there have been changes in the corporate credit spreads and industry asset beta which has led to an increase in the overall discount rate for the majority of countries.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the five year forecast period has been reduced to 1.2% 2014: 1.5% in line with the more challenging economic environment.
EBIT margins EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues, and the impact of associated management actions.

On 12 January 2015, the Group repaid US$90m US dollar fixed rate notes and 12m Sterling fixed rate notes as they fell due.
These were refinanced using existing facilities, including the US$800m multi-currency revolving credit facility and various uncommitted Sterling borrowing facilities.
On 1 April 2015 the Group commenced a new US$1bn commercial paper programme.
At 1 January 2016, a total of 166.4m 2014: nil was outstanding under the programme.
In September 2014, the Group amended the US$800m multi-currency revolving credit facility, which was previously refinanced in July 2013 and due to mature in July 2018.
The amendment extended the maturity date to July 2019, with the option of two one-year extensions.
In July 2015, the option to extend the maturity to July 2020 was exercised.
At 1 January 2016, US$70.0m 2014: US$209.8m was drawn under the revolving credit facility.

It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts.
Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benefits of the contract.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Employee related Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations, some of which are for asbestos-related claims.
Asbestos-related claims Certain of the Groups US-based subsidiaries are co-defendants in lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
The Group has comprehensive insurance cover for these cases with all claims directly managed by the Groups insurers who also meet all associated defence costs.
The insurers and their legal advisers agree and execute the defence strategy between them and there are no related cash flows to or from the Group.
We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future as long as the litigation arises.
The Weir Group PLC 162 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements A review was completed in 2014, in conjunction with external advisers, to assess the adequacy of the Groups insurance policies to meet future settlement and defence costs.
As a result of this review a provision of 28m was recorded in 2014 with an equivalent receivable for insurance proceeds based on an estimate of settlement and defence costs for existing and projected claims received in the subsequent five year period.
The cash flows associated with this claim profile have been assessed as extending to a period of 10 years from the balance sheet date and the modelling coincides with this period.
In the current period costs have been charged against the provision however further charges have been made to reflect new claims.
During the current period, the estimates underlying the provision have continued to be reassessed and refined.
The period of claims history has been further analysed to improve understanding of key drivers, including the originating State of claims, average settlement and defence costs per State and the occurrence of one-off claims and or settlements.
This analysis, coupled with the further year of claims experience supports the estimates made in the prior year and therefore the same principles have been used consistently to form the basis of the financial modelling in 2015.
A provision of 28m continues to represent the Directors best estimate of the future liability, although these estimates and the period over which they are assessed will continue to be refined as the claims history builds.
An equivalent asset continues to be recognised for insurance proceeds.
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with estimating future costs in respect of asbestos-related diseases, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred.
However, we do not expect there to be a net financial exposure to the Group given the comprehensive insurance cover in place.
In the UK, there are outstanding asbestos-related claims which are not the subject of insurance cover.
The Group provides for both based on managements best estimate of the likely costs given past experience of the volume and cost of similar claims brought against the Group.
It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the period up to 2025.
Exceptional rationalisation As part of the Group-wide efficiency review announced in November 2014, the 2015 Oil & Gas downturn actions and other restructuring actions, the Group has provided an additional 47.6m during the period.
The provision incorporates committed costs for the closure of small manufacturing facilities, consolidation of service centres and workforce reductions.
The majority of the provision will be utilised in 2016.
Other Other provisions relate to an environmental clean up programme in the United States for a company acquired in 1992, the discontinued operations and indemnity provision, and various other legal claims and exposures across the Group.
The environmental provision is based on managements current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme.
It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the period up to 2019.

DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED The movement in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the period was as follows.
Untaxed Overseas reserves & Post Accelerated tax on other employment depreciation for unremitted Intangible temporary benefits tax purposes earnings assets differences Total m m m m m m At 3 January 2014 15.7 35.5 24.3 147.9 43.7 148.3 Prior year adjustments 0.2 0.2 Acquisitions restated note 2 11.3 12.0 0.7 Credited charged to the income statement note 7 0.2 1.6 0.2 8.2 3.9 10.5 Credited to equity 5.1 0.9 6.0 Exchange adjustment 0.4 0.9 0.4 9.0 2.2 6.9 At 2 January 2015 restated note 2 21.4 37.8 24.1 160.0 62.5 138.0 Prior year adjustments 19.8 20.2 0.4 Charged credited to the income statement note 7 1.9 3.0 2.6 26.4 19.5 49.6 Charged to equity 2.3 0.3 2.6 Exchange adjustment 0.1 1.0 6.0 0.8 4.1 At 1 January 2016 17.3 15.0 20.5 159.8 82.9 95.1 Untaxed reserves primarily relate to temporarily disallowed inventory receivable provisions and accruals provisions for liabilities where the tax allowance is deferred until the cash expense occurs.
In relation to the increase of the untaxed reserves, 9.0m relates to carried forward interest deductions in the US.
US tax rules allow surplus interest expenses to be carried forward indefinitely to be used against future earnings.
Forecasts have been prepared which indicate that this interest will be able to be offset in 2017 and 2018 therefore it is considered appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of this amount.
Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 7.3m 2014: 5.8m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 4.4m 2014: 5.8m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments A deferred tax liability of 20.5m 2014: 24.1m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries and the unremitted earnings of the UK and Canadian subsidiaries of the US subgroup.
As at 2 January 2015, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 1,515.8m 2014: 1,607.0m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
UK corporation tax rate changes A number of changes which reduce future UK corporation tax rates were announced in the UK Summer Budget Statement of 8 July 2015.
Following on from this, legislation was enacted on 26 October 2015 such that the main rate of UK corporation tax will be 19.0% from April 2017 and 18.0% from April 2020.
Consequently UK deferred tax has been provided at the prevalent rates during the periods in which the UK temporary differences are expected to unwind.
Consequently, deferred tax has been provided on UK temporary differences at 19.9% 2014: 20.0%.
PENSIONS & OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS The Group has four main defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America.
All defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The most significant of the defined benefit plans are the two funded UK plans.
UK plans The Group has two funded defined benefit plans the Main Plan and the Executive Plan and an unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired executive directors.
The Group also operates a defined contribution plan, the contributions to which are in addition to those set out below, and are charged directly to the income statement.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary.
The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits effective from 30 June 2015 and an exceptional curtailment gain of 2.7m was recognised in 2013.
This was reassessed in 2015 and no adjustment was required.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 16 years and from the Executive Plan is around 12 years.
The Weir Group PLC 164 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits.
The Main Plan holds insurance policies in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
This risk is significantly reduced for the Main Plan through the insurance policies held.
North American plans The Group also sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United States and Canada and certain unfunded post-employment healthcare benefits for senior employees in the United States.
These plans combined make up 3% of the Groups pension and other post-employment benefit plan commitments and 2% of the Groups total associated assets.
The weighted average duration of these plans is around 11 years.
Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions in each of the relevant countries in which the Group operates and are as follows.
North American UK North American post-retirement pensions pensions healthcare 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Significant actuarial assumptions: Discount rate % pa 3.7 3.5 4.2 3.9 4.2 3.9 Retail Prices inflation assumption % pa 3.0 3.0 n a n a n a n a Post-retirement mortality life expectancies in years : Current pensioners at 65 male 22.4 22.1 21.2 21.7 21.2 21.7 Current pensioners at 65 female 24.5 24.6 23.2 23.9 23.2 23.9 Future pensioners at 65 male 24.1 23.9 22.9 23.3 22.9 23.4 Future pensioners at 65 female 26.4 26.5 24.9 25.5 24.9 25.6 Other related actuarial assumptions: Rate of increases for pensions in payment % pa Pre 6 April 2006 service 2.9 2.9 n a n a n a n a Post 5 April 2006 service 2.0 2.0 n a n a n a n a Consumer Prices inflation assumption % pa 2.0 2.0 n a 1.9 n a 2.0 Rate of increase in healthcare costs n a n a n a n a 7.7% per annum decreasing to 4.5% per annum and remaining static at that level from 2028 onwards.
7.2% per annum decreasing to 4.5% per annum and remaining static at that level from 2028 onwards.
The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following periods cost.
For North America, weighted average assumptions are shown where applicable.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member retiring in 2036 in 20 years time.
The Weir Group PLC 165 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 24.
PENSIONS & OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS CONTINUED Assumptions continued The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.
Total 2015 2014 m m Plan assets at fair value Equities quoted 174.5 165.9 Diversified Growth Funds primarily quoted 46.4 42.3 Corporate bonds quoted 77.0 77.9 Government bonds quoted 81.2 86.0 Insurance policies unquoted 345.1 357.7 Cash quoted 3.2 12.1 Fair value of plan assets 727.4 741.9 Present value of funded obligations 801.4 827.0 Net funded obligations 74.0 85.1 Present value of unfunded obligations 7.8 9.2 Net liability 81.8 94.3 Plan in surplus 8.2 4.1 Plan in deficit 90.0 98.4 The government bonds held are primarily index-linked, with around only 7% of the total government bonds being fixed interest.
The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets used by the Group.
In the UK, where the majority of the Groups pension assets are held, the investment strategy is to hold equities and other return seeking assets such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners.
For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.
The change in net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is comprised as follows.
2015 2014 m m Opening net liabilities 94.3 70.4 Expense charged to profit and loss 5.0 4.9 Amount recognised in statement of comprehensive income 13.5 31.1 Employer contributions 4.3 13.0 Currency adjustment 0.3 0.9 Closing net liabilities 81.8 94.3 The Weir Group PLC 166 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period are analysed as follows.

Deficit reduction measures in two small North American plans resulted in a settlement credit of 0.5m and a curtailment gain of 0.2m in 2014.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group made special contributions of 2.6m in 2015 2014: 10.6m in addition to the Groups regular contributions.
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2014 when the funding shortfall was 65.0m.
Under the recovery plan agreed with Trustees, the Group entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it will contribute interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP for the Main Plan.
The Main Plans interests in the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.
As a partner in the SLP, the Main Plan is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years, subject to conditions being met.
The profits to be shared with the Plan will be reflected in the Groups financial statements as a pension contribution.
The first contribution of 2m will be made to the Plan in 2016, rising to 4m for 2018 and beyond.
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of 10.6m with agreed recovery contributions of 2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017, subject to reassessment at future triennial valuations.
The Group has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a current surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement.
This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the balance sheet and that recognition of a current surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.
For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Group to adjust the balance sheet to recognise the future agreed deficit recovery contributions.
Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input received and noting that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the schemes without cause, the Directors of the Group have concluded that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Group has confirmed that the above accounting treatment will not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14.
The total Group contributions for 2016 including those expected from the SLP in the UK are expected to be 5.8m.
The Weir Group PLC 167 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 24.
PENSIONS & OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS CONTINUED Sensitivity analysis Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2016.
The effects of changes in those assumptions are set out in the table below.
Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m Discount rate Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 110.9 132.7 121.4 147.0 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 80.9 99.5 87.0 108.6 RPI inflation and associated assumptions Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 69.7 64.3 77.4 72.8 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 47.6 43.4 54.4 49.9 Life expectancy Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1 year change 24.7 24.7 22.9 22.9 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change 12.0 12.0 12.2 12.2 The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested non-insurance policy assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.

COMMITMENTS & LEGAL CLAIMS Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial leases for land and buildings, motor vehicles and plant & equipment.
Land and building leases have an average term of between two and ten years, motor vehicle leases have an average term of between two and four years and plant & equipment leases have an average term of between three and five years.
Certain leases have terms of renewal, at the option of the lessee, but there are no purchase options or escalation clauses.

Legal claims The Company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
A claim made by Philippines Gold Processing & Refining Corporation against Weir Services Australia Pty Limited WSA, a subsidiary of the Company, was defended at arbitration, with the successful judgement issued in favour of WSA in January 2016.
During the arbitration process, the Group entered into a cap and collar agreement with the claimant, which limited the potential exposure for the Group to a fide minimus amount.
EQUITY SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS LTIP There are three types of award which may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares.
Details of each award are outlined in the Remuneration Report on pages 95 to 117.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average share prices WASP of shares awarded under the LTIP.

This comprises a credit of 0.2m 2014: 1.5m charge in respect of parent company employees and a credit of 0.3m 2014: 1.6m charge in respect of employees of subsidiaries.
Certain subsidiary companies made a cash contribution to the parent company of 5.1m 2014: 4.9m in the period in respect of their employees LTIP awards.

The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is volatility indicative of future trends which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Market related performance conditions have been taken into account in the calculation of fair values.
Deferred Bonus Plan There are three types of award which were made under the Deferred Bonus Plan: shares purchased on the employees behalf as part of the annual bonus, matching shares and strategic shares for senior executives.

FINANCIAL ASSETS & LIABILITIES Financial risk management objectives & policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk.
Foreign currency transactional risk arises when operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.
Translational risk arises on the translation of overseas earnings and investments into Sterling for consolidated reporting purposes.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract, and liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Groups treasury function.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where a significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified may also apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash flow hedge.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk, the Group has a policy to partially hedge its net exposure to United States dollar US$, Australian dollar AUD, Euro EUR and South African rand ZAR.
This is achieved through designating an element of foreign currency borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy Liquidity risk could impact negatively on the Groups reputation, borrowing costs or ultimately its ability to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of fixed rate loan notes, bank loans, commercial paper and bank overdrafts.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20. Credit risk policy Credit risk could have a negative impact on reported earnings and cash and consequently the liquidity of the Group.
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken with external credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and enforced.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits, and by only trading with counterparties that have an investment grade credit rating or better at contract inception, based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market view of a counterpartys credit quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate.
Accordingly in normal market conditions, the probability of material loss due to non-performance by counterparties is considered to be low.
Interest rate risk policy The Groups borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term.
Details of changes to the Groups loans and facilities have been included in note 20.
Net investment in foreign operations As at 1 January 2016, US dollar fixed rate notes of US$345.9m 2014: US$435.9m, US dollar variable rate loans of US$70.0m 2014: US$70.0m and commercial paper of 70.0m 2014: nil, all included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cross currency swaps of US$69.9m and AUD151.0m 2014: US$89.4m and AUD151.0m and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$279.9m and ZAR345.0m 2014: US$170.4m and ZAR345.0m have been designated as a hedge of the Groups exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM, Weir Warman, Weir Seaboard, Weir Novatech, Weir Mathena, Weir Minerals Australia, Weir Multiflo, Weir Minerals France, Weir Gabbioneta, Weir Heavy Bay Foundry and Weir Warman Africa.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and contingent consideration and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries.

The Weir Group PLC 175 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 30.
FINANCIAL ASSETS & LIABILITIES CONTINUED Carrying amounts & fair values continued The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The derivative financial instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates, interest rate curves, counterparty and own credit risk.
The fair value of cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 1 January 2016 and 2 January 2015 the Group has classified contingent consideration as level 3.
A reconciliation of the movements in the contingent consideration fair value has been included in note 13.
During the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2016 and 2 January 2015, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
The basis for the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration is outlined in detail in note 13.

FINANCIAL ASSETS & LIABILITIES CONTINUED Interest rate risk & maturity profile continued Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity through the impact on floating rate borrowings and cross currency swaps in respect of each currency to which the Group has a significant exposure to interest rate risk.

Effect of hedge & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments and on its net investments in foreign operations.
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
During the period, four subsidiaries within the Group have applied cash flow hedge accounting to these forward foreign currency transactions.
In addition the Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge translation currency risk associated with its net investments in foreign operations.
During the period the Group had eight relationships where net investment hedge accounting was applied to these forward foreign currency transactions.
All other forward foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash flow or net investment hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the period in profit or loss and equity for each derivative financial instrument are set out below.

The Groups forward foreign currency contracts subject to cash flow hedge accounting which were deemed to be ineffective during the period resulted in a net charge to the income statement of nil 2014: nil.
Foreign exchange risk The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian dollar, Euro and US dollar.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualifying as either cash flow or net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualifying as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps.
The sensitivity analysis below has been presented to demonstrate the impact of a 25% strengthening of the relevant functional currency against the currencies shown below and therefore give an indication of the transactional foreign exposure that exists at a subsidiary level across the Group.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Net debt to EBITDA cover Net debt to EBITDA comprises net debt divided by operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, depreciation, intangibles amortisation and impairment.
The Group considers that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is the key metric from a capital management perspective and seeks to maintain the ratio below two times.
Given the prolonged downturn currently in oil and gas markets, the metric has increased to 2.6 times but remains actively managed.
