It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
With-profits business represents the gross of tax shareholders transfer from the with-profits fund for the year.
Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality and morbidity.
Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the year attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment profit for insurance as well as items that are more appropriately included in other sources of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
DAC adjustments comprise DAC amortisation for the year, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.
Analysis of pre-tax IFRS operating profit by source and margin analysis of Group long-term insurance business The following analysis expresses certain of the Groups sources of operating profit as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other suitable driver.

Analysis of Asia operating profit drivers: Spread income increased by 21 per cent at constant exchange rates to 153 million in 2015, predominantly reflecting the growth of the Asia non-linked policyholder liabilities.
Fee income increased by 5 per cent at constant exchange rates from 154 million in 2014 to 162 million in 2015, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unit-linked liabilities.
Insurance margin increased by 17 per cent at constant exchange rates to 783 million in 2015, predominantly reflecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
Margin on revenues increased by 200 million at constant exchange rates to 1,732 million in 2015, primarily reflecting higher premium income recognised in the year.
Acquisition costs increased by 13 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 13 per cent to 1,161 million in 2015, compared to the 26 per cent increase in APE sales AER 28 per cent increase, resulting in a decrease in the acquisition costs ratio.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE sales.
If with-profits APE sales were excluded from the denominator the acquisition cost ratio would become 68 per cent 2014: 66 per cent at CER, the small increase being the result of changes to product and country mix.
Administration expenses increased by 14 per cent at constant exchange rates to 701 million in 2015 as the business continues to expand.
At constant exchange rates, the administration expense ratio has increased from 253 basis points in 2014 to 258 basis points in 2015, the result of changes to product and country mix.

Analysis of US operating profit drivers: Spread income declined by 6 per cent at constant exchange rates AER increased by 2 per cent to 746 million in 2015.
The reported spread margin decreased to 241 basis points from 256 basis points in 2014 primarily due to lower investment yields.
Spread income benefited from swap transactions previously entered into to more closely match the asset and liability duration.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 166 basis points 2014 CER: 182 basis points and AER: 183 basis points.
Fee income increased by 11 per cent at constant exchange rates AER 19 per cent to 1,672 million in 2015, primarily due to higher average separate account balances reflecting positive net cash flows from variable annuity business.
Fee income margin has remained broadly in line with the prior year at 192 basis points 2014 CER: 194 basis points and AER: 193 basis points.
Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Insurance margin increased to 796 million in 2015 compared to 722 million in the previous year at constant exchange rates, primarily due to higher fee income from variable annuity guarantees following positive net flows in recent periods into variable annuity business with guarantees.
REALIC contributed 215 million to this total 2014: 233 million at constant exchange rates.
Acquisition costs, which are commissions and expenses incurred to acquire new business, including those that are not deferrable, decreased in absolute terms at constant exchange rates in line with trends observed in recent years.
As a percentage of APE sales, acquisition costs have decreased to 54 per cent, compared to 57 per cent in 2014.
This is due to the continued increase in producers selecting asset-based commissions which are treated as an administrative expense in this analysis, rather than front-end commissions.
Administration expenses increased to 828 million in 2015 compared to 747 million for 2014 at constant exchange rates AER 693 million, primarily as a result of higher asset-based commissions paid on the larger 2015 separate account balance subject to these trail commissions.
These are paid on policy anniversary dates and are treated as an administration expense in this analysis.
Excluding these trail commissions, the resulting administration expense ratio would be unchanged at 36 basis points 2014: CER 36 basis points and AER 36 basis points.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information Analysis of UK operating profit drivers: Spread income reduced from 272 million in 2014 to 258 million in 2015, mainly due to lower annuity new business profit post the reforms brought about by Pension Freedoms.
Fee income principally represents asset management fees from unit-linked business, including direct investment only business to group pension schemes, where liability flows are driven by a small number of large single mandate transactions and fee income mostly arises within our UK asset management business.
Excluding these schemes, the fee margin on the remaining balances was 43 basis points 2014: 41 basis points.
With-profits transfers increased from 255 million in 2014 to 269 million in 2015, due to an increase in terminal bonus rates.
Insurance margin increased to 180 million in 2015, reflecting the higher contribution from longevity reinsurance transactions undertaken during the first half of the year, positive experience in the year and the modest net effect of the annual review of assumptions.
Margin on revenues represents premium charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
The 2015 margin remained stable at 179 million compared to the previous year.
Acquisition costs incurred declined to 86 million, equivalent to 8 per cent of total APE sales in 2015 2014: 12 per cent.
The decline reflects a shift in business mix towards with-profits business where acquisition costs are funded by the estate.
The acquisition cost ratio is also distorted by the high contribution to APE of bulk annuity sales in the year, where acquisition costs are comparatively lower.
Acquisition costs expressed as a percentage of shareholder-backed APE sales excluding the bulk annuity transactions were 36 per cent 2014: 36 per cent.
Administration expenses increased by 16 million to 159 million in 2015 largely due to increased spend associated with UK pension reforms.
The contribution from specific management actions undertaken in the second half of 2015 to position the balance sheet more effectively under the new Solvency II regime was 339 million.

These actions included extending the reinsurance of longevity risk to cover 8.7 billion of annuity liabilities on a Pillar 1 basis by the end of 2015 end 2014: programme covered 2.3 billion of liabilities.
It also included the repositioning of the fixed income asset portfolio, increasing to 95 per cent the proportion that would benefit from the matching adjustment under Solvency II.

31 December 2015 Estimated Group Solvency II capital position bn Own funds 20.1 Solvency capital requirement 10.4 Surplus 9.7 Solvency ratio 193% These results allow for: Capital in Jackson in excess of 250 per cent of the US local Risk Based Capital requirement.
As agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority, this is incorporated in the result above as follows: Own funds: represent Jacksons local US Risk Based available capital less 100 per cent of the US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : and Solvency Capital Requirement: represent 150 per cent of Jacksons local US Risk Based Capital requirement Company Action Level : Non-recognition of a portion of Solvency II surplus capital relating to the Groups Asia life operations, reflecting regulatory prudence: Matching adjustment for UK annuities, based on the 31 December 2015 calibration published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority: and Transitional measures which have the effect of preserving the Solvency II surplus for our UK business at the same level as under Solvency I, for business written before 1 January 2016.
The Groups Solvency II capital surplus excludes: Diversification benefits between Jackson and the rest of the Group: Surplus in ring-fenced with-profits funds including the shareholders share of the estate of with-profits funds: and Surplus in pension funds.
Analysis of movement in capital position We previously reported our economic capital results at year end 2013 and year end 2014 before there was certainty in the final outcome of Solvency II and before we received internal model approval.
The Solvency II results now reflect the output from our approved internal model under the final Solvency II rules.
Allowing for this change in basis, the movement from the previously reported economic capital basis solvency surplus at 31 December 2014 to the Solvency II approved internal model surplus at 31 December 2015 is set out in the table below: Analysis of movement in Group surplus bn Economic capital surplus as at 1 January 2015 9.7 Operating experience 2.4 Non-operating experience including market movements 0.6 Other capital movements Subordinated debt issuance 0.6 Foreign currency translation impacts 0.2 Dividends paid 1.0 Methodology and calibration changes Changes to Own Funds net of transitionals and Solvency Capital Requirement calibration strengthening 0.2 Effect of partial derecognition of Asia Solvency II surplus 1.4 Estimated Solvency II surplus as at 31 December 2015 9.7 The movement in Group surplus over 2015 is driven by: Operating experience of 2.4 billion: generated by in-force business and new business written in 2015, including 0.4 billion of benefit from the specific actions taken in the second half of the year to position the balance sheet more efficiently under the new Solvency II regime: Non-operating experience of 0.6 billion: mainly arising from negative market experience during the year: and Other capital movements: comprising an increase in capital from subordinated debt issuance, a gain from positive foreign currency translation effects and a reduction in surplus from payment of dividends.
In addition, the methodology and calibration changes arising from Solvency II relate to: A 0.2 billion reduction in surplus due to an increase in the Solvency Capital Requirement from strengthening of internal model calibrations, mainly relating to longevity risk, operational risk, credit risk and correlations, and a corresponding increase in the risk margin, which is partially offset by UK transitionals: and A 1.4 billion reduction in surplus due to the negative impact of Solvency II rules for contract boundaries and a reduction in the capital surplus of the Groups Asia life operations, as agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority.
co. uk Annual Report 2015 Prudentialplc 343 Additional unaudited financial information continued II: Other information continued c Solvency II capital position at 31 December 2015 continued The change in US treatment from including 150 per cent, rather than 250 per cent of US Risk Based Capital Company Action Level in the Group Solvency Capital Requirement, is offset by a corresponding reduction in the Group Own Funds and therefore has no impact on surplus despite the positive impact on the solvency ratio.
The impacts above, including the impact of the change in basis from economic capital to Solvency II, represent an overall reduction in the Group solvency ratio from 218 per cent to 193 per cent.

This item also reflects a derecognition of Own Funds of 0.7 billion, equivalent to the value of 100 per cent of Risk Based Capital requirements Company Action Level, as agreed with the Prudential Regulation Authority: 3.7 billion due to the removal of DAC, goodwill and intangibles from the IFRS balance sheet: 4.4 billion due to the addition of subordinated debt which is treated as available capital under Solvency II but as a liability under IFRS: 2.5 billion due to the inclusion of a risk margin for UK and Asia non-hedgeable risks, net of transitionals, all of which are not applicable under IFRS: 3.1 billion due to the inclusion of the value of future shareholder transfers from with-profits business excluding the shareholders share of the with-profits estate, for which no credit is given under Solvency II, which is excluded from the determination of the Groups IFRS shareholders funds: 8.6 billion due to differences in insurance valuation requirements between Solvency II and IFRS, with Solvency II Own Funds partially capturing the value of in-force business which is excluded from IFRS: 0.9 billion due to the impact on the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the other valuation differences noted above: and 0.4 billion due to other items, including the impact of revaluing loans, borrowings and debt from IFRS to Solvency II.
Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2015, the estimated sensitivity of the Group Solvency II surplus to significant changes in market conditions is as follows: An instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets would reduce surplus by 1.0 billion and reduce the solvency ratio to 186 per cent: A 40 per cent fall in equity markets comprising an instantaneous 20 per cent fall followed by a further 20 per cent fall over a four-week period would reduce surplus by 1.8 billion and reduce the solvency ratio to 179 per cent: A 50 basis points reduction in interest rates subject to a floor of zero and allowing for transitional recalculation would reduce surplus by 1.1 billion and reduce the solvency ratio to 179 per cent: A 100 basis points increase in interest rates allowing for transitional recalculation would increase surplus by 1.1 billion and increase the solvency ratio to 210 per cent: and A 100 basis points increase in credit spreads with credit defaults of 10 times the expected level in Jackson would reduce surplus by 1.2 billion and reduce the solvency ratio to 187 per cent.
1, 2 UK Solvency II capital position On the same basis as above, the estimated UK Solvency II surplus at 31 December 2015 was 3.3 billion.
This relates to shareholderbacked business including the shareholders share of future with-profits transfers, but excludes the shareholders share of the estate in line with Solvency II requirements.
While the surplus position of the UK with-profits funds remains strong on a Solvency II basis, it is ring-fenced from the shareholder balance sheet and is therefore excluded from both the Group and the UK shareholder Solvency II surplus results.
The estimated UK with-profits funds Solvency II surplus at 31 December 2015 was 3.2 billion.
31 December 2015 bn UK UK Estimated Solvency II capital position shareholder with-profits Own Funds 10.5 7.6 Solvency Capital Requirement 7.2 4.4 Surplus 3.3 3.2 Solvency ratio 146% 175% The UK with-profits funds surplus has reduced from 3.7 billion at 30 June 2015 to 3.2 billion at 31 December 2015.
This is principally due to an increase in the equity backing ratio of the Prudential Assurance Company with-profits sub-fund by 5 per cent, in order to utilise the strength of the fund in line with the Principles and Practices of Financial Management, and strong new business growth.

The additional reconciling items to Solvency II mainly reflect the risk margin net of transitionals, with other items including differences in the definition of the risk-free rate and the matching adjustment impact for non-profit annuity liabilities within the with-profits funds.
UK shareholder sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2015, the estimated sensitivity of the UK shareholder Solvency II surplus to significant changes in market conditions is as follows: An instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets would reduce surplus by 0.4 billion: A 40 per cent fall in equity markets would reduce surplus by 0.8 billion: A 50 basis points reduction in interest rates subject to a floor of zero and allowing for transitional recalculation would reduce surplus by 0.7 billion: A 100 basis points increase in interest rates allowing for transitional recalculation would increase surplus by 0.9 billion: A 100 basis points increase in credit spreads would reduce surplus by 0.2 billion: and 15 per cent of the UK annuity portfolio downgrading by one whole letter rating would reduce surplus by 0.5 billion.
Statement of independent review The methodology, assumptions and overall result have been subject to examination by KPMG LLP.
d IGD capital position at 31 December 2015 Up to 31 December 2015, Prudential was subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union Insurance Groups Directive as implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK.
The Insurance Groups Directive capital surplus represents the aggregated surplus capital on a Prudential Regulation Authority consistent basis of the Groups regulated subsidiaries less the Groups borrowings.
No diversification benefit is recognised.
We estimate that our Insurance Groups Directive capital surplus is 5.5 billion at 31 December 2015 before taking into account 2015 second interim ordinary and special dividends, with available capital covering our capital requirements 2.5 times.
This compares to a capital surplus of 4.7 billion at the end of 2014 before taking into account the 2014 final dividend.
The movements in 2015 mainly comprise: Net capital generation inclusive of market and foreign exchange movements mainly through operating earnings in-force releases less investment in new business, net of tax of 1.8 billion: and 0.6 billion of subordinated debt issuance.
Offset by: Final 2014 dividend of 0.7 billion and first interim 2015 dividend of 0.3 billion: and External financing costs and other central costs, net of tax, of 0.6 billion.
IGD surplus represents the accumulation of surpluses across all of our operations based on local regulatory minimum capital requirements with some adjustments, pursuant to the requirements of Solvency I.
The calculation does not fully adjust capital requirements for risk nor does it capture the true economic value of assets.

Although a small amount less than 3 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare our 2015 results.
The impact of Solvency II which is effective from 1 January 2016 is not reflected in the analysis below in line with the guidance issued by the CFO Forum.
The new regulatory regime will not impact the free surplus generation profile of our operations in Asia and the US as Solvency II does not act as the local constraint on the ability to distribute profits to the Group.
For these businesses, free surplus generation will continue to be driven by local regulatory and target capital requirements.
For the UK insurance operations, Solvency II will alter free surplus generation and an early estimate is provided in section D of the additional unaudited information.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2015, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2015 over the same 40-year period.

348 Prudential plc Annual Report 2015 www.
co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information At 31 December 2015 the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years 2016 to 2020 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as those underpinning our 2015 embedded value reporting was 12.2 billion, an increase of 1.2 billion from the 11.0 billion expected over the same period at the end of 2014.
This increase primarily reflects the new business written in 2015, which is expected to generate 1,556 million of free surplus over the next five years.
At 31 December 2015 the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 50.8 billion, up from the 47.1 billion expected at the end of 2014 reflecting the effect of new business written across all three business operations of 6.6 billion and a positive foreign exchange translation effect of 0.4 billion.
These positive effects have been offset by a 0.8 billion adverse effect reflecting operating, market assumption changes and other items.
In Asia, these principally reflect the impact of falls in equity market returns and bond values.
In the US these mainly reflect higher future separate account growth due to the increase in interest rates, together with improved persistency.
Offsetting these positive impacts is the negative effect of lower than expected separate account growth in the year due to broadly flat equity market returns in 2015.
In the UK, these mainly arise from the effect of longevity reinsurance transactions entered into during the year and the effect of a partial hedge to protect future shareholder with-profits transfers from declines in UK equity markets.
The longevity reinsurance transactions executed this year had the effect of accelerating the generation of future free surplus into 2015.
The overall growth in the Groups undiscounted value of free surplus reflects our ability to write both growing and profitable new business.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2015 from life business in force at the end of 2015 was 3.3 billion including 0.6 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2015 realisation at the end of 2014 of 2.5 billion.

co. uk Directors European Embedded Value 01 Group overview 02 Strategic report 03 Governance 04 r emuneration report 05 Financial statements 06 EEV basis results 07 Additional information i Effect of Solvency II on EEV basis results on 1 January 2016 i Group summary The Solvency II framework is effective from 1 January 2016.
For our operations in Asia and the US there is no impact on the EEV results since Solvency II does not act as the local constraint on the ability to distribute profits to the Group.
The embedded value and profile of free surplus generation for these businesses will continue to be driven by local regulatory and target capital requirements.
For the UK insurance operations Solvency II will impact the EEV results as it changes the local regulatory valuation of net worth and capital requirements, affecting the components of the EEV and the expected profile of free surplus generation.
In line with guidance provided by the CFO Forum in October 2015, the impact of Solvency II on the UK EEV has not been included in the main supplementary reporting.
An early estimate on the likely impact of Solvency II on the EEV net worth and value of in-force business, together with the impact on free surplus generation is provided in this section of the additional unaudited information.
The impact of Solvency II on the EEV net worth and value of in-force business reported on 1 January 2016 are shown below: Adjustment to shareholders equity at 1 January 2016 Long-term insurance operations Total EEV m As reported at 31 December 2015 32,777 Opening adjustment at 1 January 2016 Solvency II impact on net worth 3,108 Solvency II impact on net VIF 3,412 note Total opening adjustments at 1 January 2016 304 Long-term insurance operations as at 1 January 2016 32,473 Note .
ii Expected transfer of value of in-force business and required capital to free surplus The tables below show how the UK value of in-force business and the associated required capital is expected to emerge into free surplus over the next 40 years.
A comparison is shown between the current Solvency I and Solvency II regimes.
A small amount less than 3 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date.
The modelled cash flows use the methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting, updated under Solvency II.
