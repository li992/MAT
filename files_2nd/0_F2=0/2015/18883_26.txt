Eligible Company employees have been automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme since 31 March 2013.
Defined benefit scheme Kingfisher plc is one of a number of Group companies that participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities.
The valuation of the scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013 and has been updated to 31 January 2015.
The final salary pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual with effect from July 2012.
Under UK accounting standards, the amount of surplus that can be recognised is restricted following the closure to future accrual of benefits, resulting in a full provision against the net surplus.
In 2010 11 and 2011 12 the Company entered into two phases of a property partnership arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deficit.
Further details on this arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated financial statements.

The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligation.
The discount rate is derived using a single equivalent discount rate approach, based on the yields available on a portfolio of highquality sterling corporate bonds with the same duration to that of the scheme liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reflects market expectations at the balance sheet date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme.

The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables SAPS tables projected forward to 2013 using the CMI 2013 core projection improvement factors, as published by the UK actuarial profession.
In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy.
The allowance is in line with CMI 2013 improvements subject to a long-term rate of 1.25% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females.
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows: Years 2014 15 2013 14 Age to which current pensioners are expected to live 60 now Male 86.7 86.7 Female 87.3 87.3 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live 60 in 15 years time Male 87.4 87.4 Female 88.6 88.6 www.
