ACCOUNTING POLICIES Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance The Company financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2016 2015 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 24 February 2016.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 2 January 2015 2014.
For the 52 week period ended 1 January 2016 and previous periods, the Company has reported its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
For practical purposes, a decision has been made to alter the reporting basis to reflect a calendar year, with the next annual reporting date being 31 December 2016.
This is not expected to significantly impact the reported results in 2016.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The company financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Change of GAAP The Company transitioned from the previously extant UK GAAP to FRS 101 for both periods presented.
Transition reconciliations showing all material adjustments and outlining all first-time adoption exemptions permitted under IFRS 1 are disclosed in note 18.
The accounting policies which follow set out the policies that apply in preparing the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2016 2015 and the restated comparative information for the 52 weeks ended 2 January 2015 2014.
The Company has taken early adoption of SI2015 980 for presentational purposes in order to align with the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of estimates & judgements The Companys significant accounting policies are set out below.
The preparation of the company financial statements, in conformity with FRS 101, requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Management base these judgements, estimates and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance.
Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgements and assumptions, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas where management consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions are required are those in respect of provisions note 9, retirement benefits note 10 and deferred taxation note 13.
Foreign currency translation The presentational and functional currency of the Company is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant & equipment Depreciation of property, plant & equipment, other than assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Long leasehold land & buildings 20 years Plant & equipment 3 10 years Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows: Purchased software 4 8 years Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
The Weir Group PLC 186 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK.
For defined benefit pension plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in the period reflects the net interest on the net pension liability.
This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan, and hence reducing the net liability, during the period.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Companys obligations and are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet amount recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Companys contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The last equity settled grant under the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS was during 2013, with no award being made in the current year.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The previously granted equity settled incentives under the EBS were determined as a percentage of the annual bonus and were matched by the Company with a share award that would vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided the individual continued to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continued to be employed by the Company at the date of vesting.
In addition the EBS included a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS was determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards granted.
The fair value was determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
Financial assets & liabilities The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement.
The Weir Group PLC 187 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the financial statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and ii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 100.5m 2014 restated: 249.5m.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.

The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of this annual report and financial statements and the record date for the final dividend.
The dividend was re-phased in 2014 such that the final payment now represents approximately two thirds, as opposed to three quarters, of the total dividend.

R E T I R E M ENT BEN E F ITS The Company has two funded defined benefit plans the Main Plan and the Executive Plan and an unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired directors.
The Company also operates a defined contribution plan.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangements are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to the income statement.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary.
The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits effective from 30 June 2015.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 16 years and from the Executive Plan it is around 12 years.
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits.
The Main Plan holds insurance policies in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners.
The Weir Group PLC 191 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 10.
R E T I R E M ENT BEN E F ITS CONTINUED The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Company to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Company that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Company to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
This risk is significantly reduced for the Main Plan through the insurance policies held by the Plan.
Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions and are as follows.
2015 2014 Significant actuarial assumptions: Discount rate % pa 3.7 3.5 Retail Prices inflation assumption % pa 3.0 3.0 Post-retirement mortality life expectancies in years : Current pensioners at 65 male 22.4 22.1 Current pensioners at 65 female 24.5 24.6 Future pensioners at 65 male 24.1 23.9 Future pensioners at 65 female 26.4 26.5 Other related actuarial assumptions: Rate of increases for pensions in payment % pa Pre 6 April 2006 service 2.9 2.9 Post 5 April 2006 service 2.0 2.0 Consumer Prices inflation assumption % pa 2.0 2.0 The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following periods cost.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member retiring in 2036 in 20 years time.
The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.
Total 2014 Restated 2015 note 18 m m Plan assets at fair value Equities quoted 168.6 157.7 Diversified Growth Funds primarily quoted 46.4 42.3 Corporate bonds quoted 71.0 70.9 Government bonds quoted 81.2 86.0 Insurance policies unquoted 345.1 357.7 Cash quoted 2.8 11.7 Fair value of plan assets 715.1 726.3 Present value of funded obligations 781.8 805.0 Net funded obligations 66.7 78.7 Present value of unfunded obligations 1.4 1.4 Net liability 68.1 80.1 Plan in surplus 8.2 4.1 Plan in deficit 76.3 84.2 The Weir Group PLC 192 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements The government bonds held are primarily index-linked, with around only 7% of the total government bonds being fixed interest.
The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Companys own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets used by the Company.
The investment strategy for the UK is to hold equities and other return seeking assets such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners.
For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.
The change in net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is comprised as follows.
2014 Restated 2015 note 18 m m Opening net liabilities 80.1 60.8 Expense charged to profit and loss 4.3 4.9 Amount recognised in statement of comprehensive income 12.9 26.7 Employer contributions 3.4 12.3 Closing net liabilities 68.1 80.1 The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period are analysed as follows.
2014 Restated 2015 note 18 m m Recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement Current service cost 1.2 2.1 Administrative expenses 0.3 0.4 Included in operating profit 1.5 2.5 Interest on net pension liability 2.8 2.4 Total expense charged to profit & loss 4.3 4.9 Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Actual return on plan assets 23.2 83.6 Less: interest on plan assets 24.8 28.8 1.6 54.8 Other actuarial losses due to Changes in financial assumptions 24.3 76.7 Changes in demographic assumptions 2.1 3.6 Experience on benefit obligations 11.9 1.2 Actuarial gains losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 12.9 26.7 Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in other finance costs.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Company made special contributions of 2.4m in 2015 2014: 10.4m in addition to the Companys regular contributions.
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2014 when the funding shortfall was 65.0m.
Under the recovery plan agreed with Trustees, the Company entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP for the Main Plan.
The Main Plans interests in the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on a FRS 101 basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for FRS 101 purposes.
As a partner in the SLP, the Main Plan is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years.
The profits to be shared with the Plan will be reflected in the Companys financial statements as a pension contribution.
The first contribution of 2.0m will be made to the Plan in 2016.
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of 10.6m with agreed recovery contributions of 2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017, subject to reassessment at future triennial valuations.
The Weir Group PLC 193 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 10.
R E T I R E M ENT BEN E F ITS CONTINUED Assumptions continued The Company has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a current surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement.
This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the balance sheet and that recognition of a current surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.
For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Company to adjust the balance sheet to recognise the future agreed deficit recovery contributions.
Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input received and noting that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the schemes without cause, the Directors of the Company have concluded that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Company has confirmed that the above accounting treatment will not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14.
The total Company contributions for 2016 including those expected from the SLP are expected to be 4.5m.
Sensitivity analysis Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported net retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2016.
The effects of changes in those assumptions are set out in the table below.
Increase Decrease 2014 2014 Increase Decrease Restated Restated 2015 2015 note 18 note 18 m m m m Discount rate Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 108.3 129.8 118.2 143.4 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 78.3 96.6 83.7 104.9 RPI inflation and associated assumptions Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 69.7 64.3 77.4 72.8 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 47.6 43.4 54.4 49.9 Life expectancy Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1 year change 23.4 23.4 21.6 21.6 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change 10.7 10.7 10.9 10.9 The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested non-insurance policy assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.
2014 Restated 2015 note 18 m m Opening defined benefit obligations 806.4 724.9 Current service cost 1.2 2.1 Interest on benefit obligations 27.6 31.2 Benefits paid 37.5 33.3 Actuarial gains losses due to Changes in financial assumptions 24.3 76.7 Changes in demographic assumptions 2.1 3.6 Experience on benefit obligations 11.9 1.2 Closing defined benefit obligations 783.2 806.4 The Weir Group PLC 194 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 I II III: Financial Statements Changes in the fair value of plan assets are analysed as follows.

The net funds of the companies party to these facilities as at 1 January 2016 amounted to 213.9m 2014: 203.0m.
Legal claims The Company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
A claim made by Philippines Gold Processing & Refining Corporation against Weir Services Australia Pty Limited WSA, a subsidiary of the Company, was defended at arbitration, with the successful judgement issued in favour of WSA in January 2016.
During the arbitration process, the Group entered into a cap and collar agreement with the claimant, which limited the potential exposure for the Group to a fide minimus amount.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The description of the Groups financial risk management objectives and policies is provided in note 30 to the Group financial statements.
These financial risk management objectives and policies also apply to the Company.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES For all periods up to and including the year ended 2 January 2015, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with previously extant United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 1 January 2016, are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual financial statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods beginning on or after 4 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in note 1.
In preparing the financial statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 4 January 2014, the Companys date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the first-time adoption of FRS 101.
As such, this note shows the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its balance sheet as at 4 January 2014 prepared under extant UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 2 January 2015.
Only pension related adjustments were required and are described below.

With the introduction of FRS 101 for the period ending 1 January 2016 onwards, the Company has recognised the full balance sheet liability for the two funded UK post-employment benefit plans as well as the unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired executive directors.
The financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 2 January 2015, have been restated to reflect these changes.
The net charge to the income statement reduced by 7.4m for 2014, as a result of the pensions cost in respect of the funded plans being less than the contributions paid over the period which were previously charged directly to the income statement.
Operating costs for 2014 decreased by 9.8m, while other finance costs increased by 2.4m.
The impact on the net charge for 2015 was an increase of 0.9m.
Operating costs for 2015 decreased by 1.9m, while other finance costs increased by 2.8m.
The total net defined benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet increased by 79.0m at 2 January 2015 and increased by 67.0m at 1 January 2016, and the total losses recognised outside of the income statement in other comprehensive income increased by 26.7m for 2014 and decreased by 12.9m for 2015.
The deferred tax is calculated at a rate of 20% in 2014 and 18% in 2015, the impact of this change is shown in note 13.
