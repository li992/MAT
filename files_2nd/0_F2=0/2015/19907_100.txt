FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED SECTION 4: FUNDING CONTINUED 4.5 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is separated into two main areas: i Development and refinancing The Group had no development borrowings as at 31 December 2015 2014: nil.
The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
The Groups policy allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
ii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements.
The majority of this floating debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2015, the Groups policy guideline has been to hedge 75% and 95% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 2-10 years.
At 31 December 2015, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 87% 2014: 100% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
Excluding the 1.7 million 2014: 79.6 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 4.6% 2014: 4.6% for an average period of 6 years 2014: 7 years, including these swaps the average rate is 4.6% 2014: 4.4%.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2015 against 1.7 million 2014: 79.6 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 2015 2014 2014 Nominal 2015 Nominal Applicable amount Applicable amount interest hedged interest rates hedged rates m % m % Within one year 23.0 3.0 Between one and two years 51.1 2.6 Between two and five years More than five years 1.7 5.6 5.5 5.6 During the year, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.7 million 2014: 0.2 million lower higher.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
For development activities, the Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific facility for the development.
The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining until the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

The bonds have a maturity date of 10 October 2018.
Under the terms of the Convertible Bond, early conversion of the debt into equity can be triggered if the share price trades over 1.3 times the conversion price for a period of time, this threshold was triggered as at 31 December 2015: the bondholders have the right to exercise until 31 March 2016: the Group do not consider conversion in this time period likely.
After this date the bondholders may exercise the Conversion Right in certain circumstances but this is contingent on a number of factors and therefore the bonds are shown to maturity in the above disclosure.
c Covenant compliance Many of the Groups funding facilities carry covenants.
The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an ongoing basis.
At 31 December 2015, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants.
The Group is able to use available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan to value LTV covenants.
The covenant headroom position is outlined below and assumes that the Group is able to use a mixture of available cash and add additional property to banks security pools.
