7 Share-based payments Employee benefits Share-based payment transactions The Group operates several share-based payment schemes, the largest of which are the Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
Details of these are provided below.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair values are calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The income statement charge is then adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting based on non market performance related criteria.
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
Administrative expenses and distribution and marketing expenses include the cost of the share-based payment schemes.
Shares in the Company, held by the trust established to administer the schemes, are shown within reserves.
The Group has chosen to adopt the exemption whereby IFRS 2, Share-Based Payments, is applied only to awards made after 7 November 2002.
The total charge included in the Income Statement in the year was 2.0 million 2014: 2.6 million.
Of the total charge 1.5 million 2014: 1.5 million related to equity-settled share schemes and 0.5 million 2014: 1.1 million related to cash-settled share schemes.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP Under the Companys DSBP, conditional awards of shares are made to plan participants to the value of 50% of their cash bonus.
The award vests after two years, normally subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no other performance conditions.
A cash payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the shares will be made to the participants on vesting.
During the year a total of 214,958 shares 2014: 17,665 were conditionally awarded to the schemes participants.
Deferred shares relating to the bonus awards to senior managers for the year ended 31 March 2015 will be awarded in June 2015. www.

At the vesting date the share award will either vest, in full or in part, or lapse.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
The terms and conditions of the LTIP are such that the vesting conditions are based on both the performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and growth in Earnings per Share over the life of the scheme.
The fair value of LTIP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below: LTIP LTIP LTIP LTIP 2014 2013 2012 2011 Total options granted 1,098,438 1,068,944 1,606,980 1,495,629 Options subject to market-based performance conditions 347,175 394,869 815,281 519,386 Fair value at grant date 116.0p 108.0p 105.0p 144.0p Assumptions used Share price 264p 256p 226p 274p Exercise price Nil Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility 31.9% 32.0% 32.1% 34.6% Expected option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 4.74% 5.09% 5.10% 7.30% Risk free interest rate 0.85% 0.58% 0.20% 1.80% Volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of the shares over a three year period up to the date of grant.
Save As You Earn Schemes SAYE The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
The option price is based on the average market price of the Companys shares over the three days prior to the offer, discounted by 20%.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for a three year period and the maintenance of employees regular monthly savings.
Failure of either of these conditions is normally deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.

com Stock Code: ECM 110 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Financial statements 8 Pension schemes Employee benefits Pension costs In the UK the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for eligible employees who joined on or before 1 April 2003.
The scheme is managed by a corporate trustee, who is required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries and the funds are independent of the Groups finances.
In addition there are material defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and the Republic of Ireland, and other retirement indemnity schemes in France and Italy.
For UK employees who joined after 1 April 2003 the Group provides a defined contribution pension scheme.
There are also defined contribution schemes in Australia, North America, Germany and the Republic of Ireland, and government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The cost of the defined benefit scheme charged to the income statement comprises: service cost, net interest cost and administrative expenses and taxes.
The Group has elected to adopt the amendment to IAS19 revised, which allows actuarial gains and losses to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income immediately.
Obligations are measured at present value using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate reflecting yields on high quality corporate bonds.
Assets are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
Every 3 years, the Trustee of the UK defined benefit scheme is required by legislation to review the level of funding in the pension scheme.
In the event that there is a funding deficit, the Trustee and the Company will agree a recovery plan to eliminate that deficit over as short a period as is reasonably affordable.
The last formal valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme was at 31 March 2013.
In order to mitigate the increase in the UK deficit, the Company has made some changes to the benefits under the UK defined benefit scheme which resulted in a one-off non cash pension credit of 20.4 million being recognised in the period.
Subsequently, the Company agreed with the Trustee a new deficit recovery plan with payments totalling 24.4 million over the next 7 years.
The net UK pension credit for the year ended 31 March 2015 amounted to 14.5 million 2014: cost of 7.2 million.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 5.2 million 2014: 5.3 million.
The Group expects to pay 6.4 million to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2015 16.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks.
For the UK scheme, following consultation with the Company, the Trustees have adopted an investment policy to mitigate some of these risks.
In particular, the scheme holds leveraged matching funds which offset some interest and inflation rate risks in respect of pensioner liabilities.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit on a statutory funding basis, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed as at 23 April 2015 that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
The costs of the defined benefit pension scheme in Germany and Republic of Ireland were 0.3 million 2014: 0.2 million.

Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 assumptions The following analysis estimates the impact of various assumption changes on the UK defined benefit pension obligation, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Effect on obligation of a 0.1% increase in the assumed discount rate Liabilities reduce by 11.0m Effect on obligation of a 0.1% increase in the assumed inflation rate Liabilities increase by 9.6m Effect on obligation of an assumed increase of one years life expectancy Liabilities increase by 15.2m 9 Income tax expense Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes are likely to be due.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these temporary differences can be utilised.

This will apply to the companys future tax charge.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2015 have been calculated at a rate of 20%.

12 Intangible assets Goodwill and other intangibles Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 31 March 1998 has been written off against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 has been capitalised and, under UK GAAP, was amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, with a maximum of 20 years.
The Group has made the elective exemption under IFRS 1 that allows goodwill in respect of acquisitions made prior to 1 April 2004 to remain as stated under UK GAAP.
The balance of goodwill as at 1 April 2004 is deemed to be the cost going forward.
Goodwill is not amortised under IFRS.
Instead the carrying value is reviewed annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
The cost of acquired intangible assets are their purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of the asset on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Trademarks 5% Software 12.5%50% Amortisation is disclosed in distribution and marketing expenses in the income statement.
The residual value, if significant, is reassessed annually.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups goodwill are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such an indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of fair value less cost of sale and value in use.
The present value of estimated future cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The value of internally generated intangible asset additions in the year was 9.6 million 2014: 7.3 million.
Value in use calculations The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on actual operating results together with management projections for five years.
These cash flows are based on extrapolations from earlier budgets and forecasts.
These are subject to assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions: for example by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows.
Cash flows for further periods, i. e. beyond five years, are extrapolated using a long term annual growth rate of 2% 2014: 2% which is consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rate for the distribution industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12.7% 2014: 7.1% has been applied in calculating the discounted projected cash flows.
com Stock Code: ECM 118 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Financial statements 12 Intangible assets continued Key assumptions The key assumptions used are the sales growth rate and discount rate.
The sales growth rate is prepared using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium term plans together with relevant macro economic indicators.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rates for the industry and do not exceed expected long term GDP growth.
The discount rate is based upon the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC at 31 March 2015 and has been calculated reflecting market assessments at that time.
The Directors believe that currently all reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
Outcome of calculations The recoverable amount of the Allied Electronics Inc. cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.
13 Property, plant and equipment Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and certain direct overheads.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Each finance leased asset is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease less accumulated depreciation.
No depreciation has been charged on freehold land.
Other assets have been depreciated to residual value, on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Freehold and leasehold buildings 2% Plant and machinery 10%20% Computer equipment 20%33% Other office equipment 20% Depreciation is disclosed in distribution and marketing expenses in the income statement.
Government grants Government grants related to expenditure on property, plant and equipment are credited to the income statement at the same rate as the depreciation on the asset to which the grants relate.
The unamortised balance of capital grants is included within trade and other payables.

com Stock Code: ECM 124 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Financial statements 21 Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
It principally employs forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in exchange rates over fixed terms of between three and six months of the majority of its operating companies.
In addition there are also a number of interest rate swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into floating rate.
In accordance with its treasury policies, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: Cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Net investment hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
All the Groups derivatives are initially and in subsequent periods recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Cash flow hedge accounting Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the non-financial asset or liability.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss that was recognised directly in equity is reclassified into the income statement in the same period during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the difference between their discounted contractual forward price and their current forward price.
Fair value hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to interest rate and exchange rate risks arising from financing activities, holding a small number of interest rate and cross currency swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into floating rate.
The fair value of the swaps is the market value of the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates.
The market value of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the income statement.
All not accounted for under fair value hedge accounting are held at amortised cost, which approximates to fair value as interest repricing takes place on a regular basis.

A Derivative financial assets and liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices.
Level 2 as defined by IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
B Interest-bearing loans held at fair value These comprise sterling and foreign currency denominated interest bearing loans which are subject to hedge accounting.
The foreign currency amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.

These loans have been designated under fair value hedge relationships.
D Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, interest-bearing loans held at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents largely comprise local bank account balances, which typically bear interest at rates set by reference to local applicable rates or cash float balances which have not yet cleared for interest purposes.
Fair values are estimated to equate to carrying amounts as their repricing maturity is less than one year.
Interest bearing loans held at amortised cost comprise fixed rate sterling and foreign currency denominated loans.
For carrying values the foreign currency principal amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
E Finance lease liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
F Other financial assets and liabilities Fair values of receivables and payables are determined by discounting future cash flows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year, fair value is assumed to approximate to the carrying amount.
Cash pooling The Group operates legal arrangements whereby cash balances and overdrafts held with the same bank are offset to give a net balance which is included within cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
These cash and bank overdraft figures before netting are shown in the tables below: Gross amounts Gross Net before amounts amounts offsetting set off presented m m m 31 March 2015 Cash at bank and in hand 310.1 309.5 0.6 Bank overdrafts 311.0 309.5 1.5 Total 0.9 0.9 31 March 2014 Cash at bank and in hand 213.1 212.7 0.4 Bank overdrafts 228.3 212.7 15.6 Total 15.2 15.2 Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.

The policies are set out below.

The Group ensures this by having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2015 the Group had the following committed debt finance in place: Private Placement notes of $150 million with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017.
A syndicated multicurrency facility for $75 million, 85 million and 50 million with a maturity of August 2019.
As at 31 March 2015, the Group had available 105.3 million of undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short term money market loans, cash and short term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day to day funding and liquidity requirements.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including contractual future interest payments.

Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Hedging of currency exposures during periods when operating companies cannot easily change their selling prices is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits during those periods.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
The Groups largest exposures relate to Euros and US Dollars.
As at 31 March 2015, net forecasted exposures in Euros and US Dollars for the first six months Euros and the first three months US Dollars of the year ending 31 March 2016 were 100% hedged.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
The Group classifies forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables and designates them as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.
The forecast cash flows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 12 months from the year end, and will affect the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2015 was nil 2014: nil.
Foreign currency transaction exposures, and the hedges in place to mitigate them, are monitored monthly by the Treasury Committee.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency transactional risk has materially altered during the year.
Foreign currency translational risk During the year ended 31 March 2010 the Group issued $37.5 million of Private Placement Notes, with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017, and, using cross-currency interest rate swaps, swapped $36.3 million to 22.5 million at a floating interest rate.
In June 2010 a further $112.5 million of Private Placement Notes, with maturities of June 2015 and June 2017 were issued, and, using cross-currency interest rate swaps the Group swapped $63.8 million into a combination of 14.8 million and 28.3 million at floating interest rates.
These cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and net investment hedges and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the Private Placement notes.
The Group has designated certain external loans as net investment hedges against its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying value of these US Dollar and Euro hedges remained highly effective, throughout the year ended 31 March 2015.
A foreign exchange loss of 5.0 million 2014: gain of 7.1 million was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to sterling in the year ended 31 March 2015.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economic and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a degree of natural hedging.
Guidelines are in place to manage the currency mix of the Groups net debt.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
com Stock Code: ECM 130 23671-04 11 June 2015 3:03 PM Proof 4 Financial statements 21 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving most of its interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
As at 31 March 2015 the Group had: Fixed the interest on $40 million borrowings from its syndicated bank facility until August 2016 using an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge Left $50 million of its Private Placement notes fixed until June 2015.
Swapped $100 million of its Private Placement Notes from US Dollar fixed to Sterling floating $60 million and Euro floating $40 million using an interest rate swap.
This is designated as a fair value hedge.
All other borrowings were at a variable rate.

There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties, customers and geographic locations.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.

Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trade receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country by country basis monthly by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.

The Board monitors the return on capital, which the Group defines as operating profit as a percentage of net assets plus net debt, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Group seeks to raise debt from a variety of sources and with a variety of maturities.
As at 31 March 2015 the Group had a Revolving Credit Facility of 85 million, $75 million and 50 million with a maturity of August 2019 and $65 million of US Private Placement PP Notes due 2015 and $85 million due 2017.
With the repayment of the $65 million PP notes due in June 2015, the Group has agreed to issue $100 million of fixed rate 5 year PP notes with completion dates in June 2015, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
These notes will be due for repayment in June 2020.
The Groups debt covenants are EBITA: Interest to be greater than 3:1 and Net Debt: EBITDA to be less than 3.25:1.
At the year end the Group comfortably met these covenants.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
