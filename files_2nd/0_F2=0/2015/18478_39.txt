88 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests The Committee believes it is important that executives build up a significant holding in Experian shares, to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Therefore, the Committee has established guidelines under which the CEO should hold at least the equivalent of three times his base salary in Experian shares and other executive directors should hold at least two times their base salary.
These guidelines include invested or deferred shares held under the CIP.
Until the shareholding guideline is met, an executive director is expected to retain at least 50% of any shares vesting net of tax under a share award.
Unvested shares are not taken into account in determining whether the guideline has been met.
Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford are building their shareholdings up to the level required by the guidelines.
Experian also has guidelines for its non-executive directors to build up a holding in the Companys shares equal to their annual fee.
Each financial year, the first quarters net fee is used to purchase Experian shares until the non-executive director reaches this holding.
The interests of the directors at 31 March 2015 and their connected persons in the Companys ordinary shares are shown below.
Shares are valued for these purposes at the closing share price on 31 March 2015, which was 11.17.
