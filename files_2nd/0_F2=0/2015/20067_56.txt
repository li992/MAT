94 BT plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2015 18. retirement benefit plans continued In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections of BTPS members benefits: Feature Detail Crown Guarantee The Crown Guarantee was granted by the Government when the group was privatised in 1984 and would only come into effect upon the insolvency of BT.
The Trustee brought court proceedings to clarify the scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee.
The Court of Appeal judgment on 16 July 2014 established that: the Crown Guarantee covers BTs funding obligation in relation to members of the Scheme who joined post-privatisation as well as those who joined pre-privatisation subject to certain exceptions : the funding obligation to which the Crown Guarantee relates is measured with reference to BTs obligation to pay deficit contributions under the rules of the Scheme.
The Crown Guarantee is not taken into account for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and is an entirely separate matter, only being relevant in the highly unlikely event that BT became insolvent.
pension protection The Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the Scheme and pay benefits to members not covered by the Crown Fund ppF Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benefits as those provided by the Scheme.
Other benefit plans In addition to the BTPS, the group maintains benefit plans in most other countries with a focus on these being appropriate for the local market and culture.
After the BTPS, the largest defined benefit plan sponsored by the group is a plan in the Netherlands with liabilities of around 180m.
The BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS is the largest defined contribution scheme maintained by the group with around 29,000 active members.
In the year to 31 March 2015, the group contributed 105m to the BTRSS.
