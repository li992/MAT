Financial Statements Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy The section covers financial assets, financial liabilities and equity held by the Group, along with associated income and expenses.
This includes cash, borrowings, put option arrangements and derivatives: working capital information is included in Section 4.
The instruments in place enable the Group to maintain its required capital structure: retaining conservative capital ratios in order to support the business and maximise shareholder value.
Further details of the Groups capital structure and financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are provided on pages 45 to 47 of the Operating and Financial Review.
Accounting policy On initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition of derivatives and financial assets and financial liabilities measured at each reporting date at fair value are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Transaction costs incurred on borrowings and other financial assets and financial liabilities measured at each reporting date at amortised cost are added to the carrying amounts of the assets or deducted from the carrying amount of the liabilities.
Put option arrangements that allow non-controlling interest shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are initially recognised at fair value within derivative financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
Interest rate swaps, forward exchange contracts, put options over non-controlling interests and other derivatives are classified as financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and are measured at each reporting date at fair value.
Changes in the fair values are included in profit or loss within financing income expense unless the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument see Note 5.5.
The Group only enters into derivative contracts with counterparties with which it has a lending relationship.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and measured at each reporting date at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Borrowings and bank overdrafts are measured at each reporting date at amortised cost.
Amortised cost takes into account any differences between the proceeds and the maturity amount, including issue costs and any discounts or premiums due on settlement.
Such differences are recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost calculation is revised when necessary to reflect changes in the expected cash flows and the expected life of the borrowings including the effects of the exercise of any prepayment, call or similar options.
Any resulting adjustment to the carrying amount of the borrowings is recognised as interest expense in the income statement.
Liabilities for contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions are measured at the date of acquisition see Note 6.1 and at each subsequent reporting date at fair value see Note 5.6.
Changes to the fair value of such consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Where terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such a modification or exchange is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the carrying amounts of the original liability and the fair value of the new liability is recognised in the income statement.

The 400m facility bears interest of LIBOR plus 0.6% whilst the Groups rating is BBBBaa3 UBMs current ratings.
The future interest rate is dependent on the credit rating of the Group: the rate will be revised to LIBOR plus 0.9% for any downgrade to BB Ba1: LIBOR plus 1.3% for downgrade to BB Ba2 or lower: LIBOR plus 0.5% for an upgrade to BBB Baa2: or LIBOR plus 0.4% for an upgrade to BBB Baa1 or higher.
In addition when 33% or less of the facility is utilised, an additional fee of 0.1% on the total amount drawn is payable: this increases to 0.2% when in excess of 33% of the facility is utilised and increases to 0.3% when in excess of 66% of the facility is utilised.
Drawings under the facility at 31 December 2015 amount to 74.0m.
The undrawn portion of this facility is 326.0m.
The Group paid arrangement fees of 2.0m in respect of the 400m syndicated revolving credit facility.
These fees are allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility using the effective interest method.
$100m bridge facility The Group entered into a $100m bridge facility agreement to part fund the acquisition of Advanstar.
The interest payable on the bridge facility was at six months LIBOR plus a margin of 0.8% until 30 June 2015.
This bridge facility was repaid and cancelled on 17 April 2015.

122 UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 5.4 Net financing expense This note details the interest income generated on the Groups financial assets and the interest expense incurred on borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
In reporting adjusted earnings the Group adjusts net financing income expense to exclude foreign exchange gains losses on forward contracts, ineffectiveness on hedges, other fair value movements and exceptional items.
Foreign exchange and fair value movements reflect the value of these instruments at a point in time, resulting in a variable impact on profit and loss.
Accounting policy Interest expense and interest income are calculated under the effective interest method.
As no interest is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use or, all interest expense is recognised as finance expense when incurred.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2015 123 Financial Statements Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy continued 5.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Accounting policy Hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge risks and accounts for them as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction: or as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any fair value gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for the change in the fair value of the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss and out of other comprehensive income in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in profit or loss.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used as net investment hedges.
All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of net investments are recognised in other comprehensive income and included in cumulative translation differences.
Foreign currency borrowings used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation are measured using the exchange rate at the reporting date.
The resulting gains or losses are taken to other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss.
Forward exchange contracts used to hedge a net investment hedge are measured at fair value at the reporting date.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs, when they are transferred to profit or loss.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss.

These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2015 and 2014 with the small ineffective portion of the hedging contracts transferred to financing expense Note 5.4.
Fair value hedges 2015 2014 m m Interest rate swaps derivative financial assets 7.5 11.3 Interest rate swaps at 31 December 2015 and 2014 include floating rate swaps for 150m matched against 150m of the 250m 6.5% sterling bonds due 2016 and $100m matched against $100m of the $350m 5.75% Dollar bonds due 2020.
Under these swaps the Group receives 6.50% and 5.75% respectively to match the bond coupons and pays six month Sterling LIBOR plus 2.90% and six month US LIBOR plus an average of 2.65% respectively.
The interest rate swaps are used to increase the Groups exposure to interest rates to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate cost.
The hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2015 and 2014 with the small ineffective portions of the hedging contracts included in financing expense.
5.6 Fair values and fair value hierarchy Valuation techniques Valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are measured using discounted cash flows.
Future cash flows are based on forward interest exchange rates from observable yield curves forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and contract interest forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the counterparties.
The fair values of put options over non-controlling interests including exercise price and contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions are measured using discounted cash flows models with inputs derived from the projected financial performance in relation to the specific contingent consideration criteria for each acquisition, as no observable market data is available.
The fair values are most sensitive to the projected financial performance of each acquisition: management makes a best estimate of these projections at each financial reporting date and regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those inputs and determines their impact on the total fair value.
An increase of 20% to the projected financial performance used in the put option measurements would increase the aggregate liability by 3.5m.
The fair value of the contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in the forecast performance.
The fair value of the 250m 6.5% Sterling bonds due 2016 and the $350m 5.75% Dollar bonds due 2020 have been measured at the present value of future cash flows discounted using market rates of interest.

Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurements at the reporting date are classified according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The level in the hierarchy within which the fair value is categorised is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: i nputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly e. g. prices or indirectly e. g. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data For financial assets and financial liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
During the reporting periods ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 measurements.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

Where any group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Company.
