John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 121 CHAIRMANS LETTER NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Dear Shareholder, I am writing to you with details of the annual general meeting AGM of John Laing Group plc John Laing or the Company which we are holding at 65 Fleet Street, London EC4Y 1HS on 12 May 2016 at 11.00am.
As this will be our first AGM following the Companys listing on the London Stock Exchange IPO in February 2015, we very much hope that as many shareholders as possible will be able to attend.
Voting on all the proposed resolutions at the AGM will be conducted on a poll rather than on a show of hands.
Voting on a poll is more transparent and equitable because it includes the votes of all shareholders, including those cast by proxies, rather than just the votes of those shareholders who attend the meeting.
Shareholders of the Company will be asked to consider and, if thought fit, approve resolutions in respect of the following matters: Ordinary business The Companys accounts and the reports of the Directors of the Company the Directors and the auditor of the Company the external auditor : The final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015: Re-election of Directors: Approval of the remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2015: Reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor for the ensuing year: Authority to determine the remuneration of the auditor: Authority to allot shares: and Authority to make political donations.
Special business Waiver of pre-emption rights in certain circumstances: Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares: and Approval to reduce the notice period for a general meeting, other than an annual general meeting.
A brief description of these matters is set out below.
Notice of AGM The formal notice of the AGM is set out on pages 125 to 128 of this document.
Report and accounts and final dividend resolutions 1 and 2 The first resolution at the AGM relates to the receipt and consideration of the Companys accounts and the reports of the Directors and the external auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2015.
Separately, shareholders will also be asked to approve the payment of a final dividend of 5.3 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015, as recommended by the Directors.
If the recommended final dividend is approved, it is proposed that the dividend will be paid on 20 May 2016 to shareholders on the Companys register of members at the close of business on 22 April 2016 the record date.
Re-election of directors resolutions 3 to 9 In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code, all the Directors of the Company being eligible will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM.
The re-election of directors will take effect from the conclusion of the meeting.
Following the evaluation exercise conducted in early 2016, as Chairman, I believe that the contribution and performance of each of the Directors continues to be valuable and effective and that it is appropriate for them to continue to serve as Directors of the Company.
In accordance with the Code, the Board has reviewed the independence of its non-executive Directors and has determined that they remain fully independent of management and that there are no relationships or circumstances likely to affect their character or judgement.
Biographical details for each of the Directors offering themselves for re-election are set out in pages 40 to 41.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 122 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 CHAIRMANS LETTER CONTINUED Directors remuneration report resolution 10 The Company believes that the Directors remuneration report, which may be found on pages 50 to 62 of the annual report and accounts, demonstrates the link between our remuneration policy and practice, and the Companys strategy and performance.
The Directors remuneration policy, a summary of which may be found on pages 52 to 57 of the annual report and accounts, sets out the Companys forward-looking policy on directors remuneration and describes the components of the executive and non-executive Directors remuneration.
The Board considers that appropriate executive remuneration plays a vital part in helping to achieve the Companys overall objectives and, accordingly, and in compliance with the legislation, shareholders will be invited to approve the Directors remuneration report and separately the Directors remuneration policy.
The annual report on remuneration is included in the Directors remuneration report and provides details of the remuneration paid to the Directors during the year ended 31 December 2015, including share awards.
Shareholders are invited to approve the annual report on remuneration under resolution 10.
This vote is advisory in nature in that payments made or promised to Directors will not have to be repaid, reduced or withheld in the event that the resolution is not passed.
This vote will be in respect of the content of the annual report on remuneration and not specific to any Directors level or terms of remuneration.
External Auditor resolutions 11 and 12 Resolutions will be proposed to reappoint Deloitte LLP as external auditor until the conclusion of the AGM in 2017 and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration.
Directors authority to allot shares resolution 13 Further to the provisions of section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 the Act, shareholders will be asked to grant the Board of Directors the authority to allot shares, grant rights to subscribe for shares, or convert any security into shares in the Company the new authority.
The new authority would be valid until the close of the AGM in 2017.
If passed, the new authority would be limited to up to 122,307,692 ordinary shares representing approximately 33.3% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 7 March 2016 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice save that, if the new authority were used in connection with a rights issue, it would be limited to up to 244,615,384 ordinary shares representing approximately 66.6% of the companys issued share capital as at 7 March 2016.
In each case the number of shares to which the new authority applies is in addition to those committed to the various employee share plans.
At the date this document was approved by the Board, the Directors had no intention to exercise this authority, although they considered its grant to be appropriate in order to preserve maximum flexibility for the future.
The Directors intend to seek the approval of shareholders to renew this authority annually.
Political donations resolution 14 The Act restricts companies from making donations to political parties, other political organisations or independent election candidates and from incurring political expenditure, in each case without shareholders consent.
It is not proposed or intended to alter the Companys policy of not making such donations or incurring such expenditure.
However, the Act contains some potentially broad definitions and it may be that some of the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries fall within these definitions and, without the necessary authorisation, this could inhibit the Companys ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups.
Accordingly, the Company believes that the authority contained in this resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the John Laing group of companies should support.
Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not unintentionally commit a technical breach of the Act.
Any expenditure which may be incurred under authority of this resolution will be disclosed in next years annual report and accounts.
It is the Companys intention to seek renewal of this resolution on an annual basis.
