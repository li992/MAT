19 Share-based payments Fidessa has share plans whereby employees are granted awards over ordinary shares subject to the vesting of their awards in accordance with the terms of each plan.
The PSP, DABP and MSPP were approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Each plan was approved by 99% of the votes cast and no votes were withheld.
The MSPP and, in the UK, the award of matching shares under the SIP were implemented in 2012 and are relevant to the majority of employees.
The first award under the DABP was made in 2012 and the first award under the PSP was made in 2014.
These plans replaced the CSOP, EGRIP and SBP from which the last awards were in 2010.
All awards from the EGRIP and SBP have expired and the final awards from the CSOP expire in 2017.
Performance Share Plan PSP This is structured as a grant of conditional shares with a zero exercise price.
The maximum for an employee in any year are awards over shares with a total market value of 500,000.
The vesting period is four years from the date of grant.
The awards vest based on the satisfaction of an earnings per share growth performance condition, which requires the cumulative four year adjusted basic earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying the annual growth rates in the table below to the base earnings per share year preceding date of grant.
At the lower threshold, 25% of an award vests with a straight-line scale to 100% vesting at the higher threshold.
Fidessa group plc 73 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Compound annual growth in EPS % of award vesting Less than 8% 0% 8% 25% Between 8% and 15% Between 25% and 100% Greater than 15% 100% In addition to the earnings per share based performance condition, in the event that the total shareholder return is below that of the FTSE techMARK Index over the performance period, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to scale back awards if it feels the level of vesting based on the earnings per share performance is, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, inappropriate.
The awards have to be called for by an employee normally within three years of vesting, thereby giving a maximum seven years life from grant.
However, in some jurisdictions the awards have to be exercised on vesting.
The shares can be satisfied by either new issue or market purchases.
A clawback provision applies to the plan for reasons of financial misstatement.
The PSP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Remuneration Committee so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Pro-rating rules apply to restrict the number of shares in early vesting situations.
The duration of the plan is 10 years from approval at the 2011 Annual General Meeting with a review taking place after five years.
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP Under Part A of this plan, participants receive a proportion of their annual bonus in the form of deferred shares instead of cash.
Under Part B of this plan, participants are only eligible to receive a one-off conditional award to acquire shares on or shortly following their joining Fidessa.
The market value of shares over which a Part B award is granted may not exceed 200% of annual salary.
The shares vest to the employee after three years subject to continued employment with Fidessa through the period and, in the case of Part B, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions applied by the Remuneration Committee.
The DABP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Remuneration Committee so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The plan is only available to participants who are resident in the UK for tax purposes due to the tax incentives associated with the SIP.
Relevant employees are able to purchase up to 125 per month.
Trust purchases of shares take place once a month and after three years an equal number of matching free shares are applied so long as there is continued employment throughout.
In the event that a participant ceases to be a Fidessa employee prior to the third anniversary of each purchase the matching shares that have not yet reached their third anniversary of purchase are forfeited.
Fidessa group plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Monthly Share Purchase Plan MSPP The MSPP follows principles similar to the UK tax approved SIP and applies to the majority of employees across multiple countries.
The MSPP operates alongside the SIP in the UK with the MSPP being used for any higher levels of monthly purchase.
Employees are able to purchase up to a set value of shares each month into a trust.
Trust purchases of shares take place once a month and in September of the third calendar year following the employees contribution an equal number of matching free shares are applied so long as there has been continued employment throughout.
The MSPP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Board so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Company Performance Related Share Option Plan This plan was introduced in 1997 and the last grant was made in 2005.
The vesting of the market price share options granted under this plan was conditional on continued employment of three and four years after the grant of the option.
Company Share Option Plan 2006 CSOP This plan was introduced in 2006 and the last grant was made in 2010.
Market price share options granted under this plan are subject to a performance condition that requires the cumulative four year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying an annual growth rate of 5% to the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year preceding grant.
Exceptional Growth Rate Incentive Plan EGRIP The plan was introduced in 2006 and the last award under it was made in 2010.
An EGRIP award represented a right to acquire shares at nominal value subject to stretching performance conditions being satisfied.
The first performance condition required the average share price plus dividends reinvested over the five year period commencing on the award date to be greater than the average derived if the share price was to increase on a uniform basis of 20% per annum compound growth over the same five year period.
The starting share price was the average share price plus dividends reinvested for the 12 months prior to the award date.
The second performance condition required the cumulative adjusted diluted earnings per share over the five years commencing with the award year to be greater than the equivalent total achieved over a five year period by applying a growth rate of 10% per annum to the adjusted diluted earnings per share achieved in the year prior to the award.
The third performance condition required the annualised total shareholder return over the five year period commencing on the award date to be greater than the annualised equivalent achieved by the FTSE techMARK All-Share Index, during the same five year period, plus 5%.
In the event that a participant ceases to be a Fidessa employee all unvested awards granted to the participant under the EGRIP will be forfeited.
Dilution limits The total permitted dilution across the PSP, DABP, MSPP and SIP is 10% in the 10 years commencing 6th May 2011 or 7% in the first five years of operation of these plans.
In addition, the potential dilution from awards granted in a calendar year cannot exceed 1.6%.
As at 31st December 2015 the maximum potential dilution from awards granted across these plans to date is 1.5%.
Fidessa group plc 75 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The total permitted dilution under the CSOP was 8% during the life of the plan: as at 31st December 2015 the maximum potential dilution is 3.5%, with the outstanding share options element of this representing 0.7%.
The total permitted dilution under the EGRIP was 6% during the life of the plan: there are no options outstanding and the total dilution incurred under the plan was 2.2%.
Fair values and awards outstanding All share plan awards are over ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting.
For share awards under the CSOP the fair value has been measured using a binomial model.
The expected volatility was based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The inputs to and output from the model are listed below: CSOP Granted in 2010 Fair value 299p Share price at grant 1421p Exercise price 1421p Expected volatility 30% Expected life 5 years Expected dividends per annum 3.0% Risk-free rate of return per annum 2.0% The fair value of awards under the EGRIP has been measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
