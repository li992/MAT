These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, and arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
The largest customer accounts for less than 5% of revenue and the 10 largest customers account for less than 30% of revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
The trade receivables as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
2015 2014 000 000 Not due 46,935 42,334 Not more than three months past due 11,311 10,583 More than three months but not more than six months past due 1,256 1,206 More than six months past due 1,209 1,761 Total trade receivables 60,711 55,884 Material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
Credit to customers is provided in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance generally being due to concerns regarding a customers solvency or the age of a receivable.
In most situations where a receivable is aged but no specific allowance has been made for it, no revenue has been taken and it forms part of the deferred revenue balance.
Collateral is not required in respect of financial assets.
Fidessa group plc 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Allowances are made when the settlement of a receivable becomes doubtful and the potential exposure is not covered by a related amount in deferred revenue.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below.
2015 2014 000 000 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 1st January 1,555 1,422 Exchange adjustment 46 51 Allowances released in the period 1,109 1,173 New allowances made in the period 597 1,255 Allowance for doubtful receivables at 31st December 1,089 1,555 Liquidity risk The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
Trade payables Accrued expenses 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 3 months or less 4,481 3,829 27,777 28,891 3 to 12 months 134 208 1,989 1,594 Greater than one year 698 346 Carrying value 4,615 4,037 30,464 30,831 It is expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis will not arise materially earlier or at significantly different values.
Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the business.
Foreign currency risk Fidessa operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and yen.
Revenue is split 56% in US dollars, 30% in sterling, 5% in yen and 9% in other currencies.
The trade debtor currency exposure is consistent with the split of revenue by currency.
