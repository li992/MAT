The principal type of credit derivatives are credit default swaps, which are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk.
Credit valuation adjustments These are adjustments to the fair values of derivative assets to reflect the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
Further details are given in note 51.
Debt restructuring This is when the terms and provisions of outstanding debt agreements are changed.
This is often done in order to improve cash flow and the ability of the borrower to repay the debt.
It can involve altering the repayment schedule as well as reducing the debt or interest charged on the loan.
Debt securities Debt securities are assets held by the Group representing certificates of indebtedness of credit institutions, public bodies or other undertakings, excluding those issued by Central Banks.

293 Other information Glossary continued Enhanced Capital Notes ECNs The Groups ECNs are subordinated notes issued by the Group that contain an embedded equity conversion feature.
Further details of these are given in note 41.
Expected loss This is the amount of loss that can be expected by the Group calculated in accordance with PRA rules.
In broad terms it is calculated by multiplying the Default Frequency by the Loss Given Default by the Exposure atDefault.

The hours or days worked by part time employees are measured against this standard and accumulated along with the number of full time employees and counted as full time equivalents.

Funded unfunded exposures Exposures where the notional amount of the transaction is either funded or unfunded.
Funding risk The risk that the Group does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient.
Impaired loans Impaired loans are loans where the Group does not expect to collect all the contractual cash flows or to collect them when they are contractually due.
Impairment allowances Impairment allowances are a provision held on the balance sheet as a result of the raising of a charge against profit for the incurred loss inherent in the lending book.
An impairment allowance may either be individual orcollective.
Impairment losses An impairment loss is the reduction in value that arises following an impairment review of an asset that determines that the assets value is lower than its carrying value.
For impaired financial assets measured at amortised cost, impairment losses are the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses can be difficult to assess and the critical accounting estimates and judgements in note3 detail the key assessments made when determining impairment losses.
Individually collectively assessed Impairment is measured individually for assets that are individually significant, and collectively where a portfolio comprises homogenous assets and where appropriate statistical techniques are available.
Individually assessed loan Impairment loss provisions for individually significant impaired loans are assessed on a case-by-case basis, impairment provisions taking into account the financial condition of the counterparty, any guarantor and the realisable value of any collateral held.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk in arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Groups non-trading assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions of the Group.

Loan to deposit ratio The ratio of loans and advances to customers net of allowance for impairment losses and excluding reverse repurchase agreements divided by customer deposits excluding repurchase agreements.

Loans past due Loans are past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due.

New mortgage lending of this type has not been offered by the Group since early 2009.
Standardised Approach In relation to credit risk, a method for calculating credit risk capital requirements using External Credit Assessment Institutions ECAI ratings of obligors where available and supervisory risk weights.
In relation to operational risk, a method of calculating the operational risk capital requirement by the application of a supervisory defined percentage charge to the gross income of specified business lines.
Stress testing Stress and scenario testing is the term used to describe techniques where plausible events are considered as vulnerabilities to ascertain how this will impact the capital resources which are required to be held.
Structured entities SEs SEs are entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
SEs often have specific restrictions around their ongoing activities and are created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective.
