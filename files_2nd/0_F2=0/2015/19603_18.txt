com 120 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 2 Business segment information The Group has historically reported two operating segments, Advanced Surgical Devices ASD and Advanced Wound Management AWM.
On 1 January 2015, the Group completed its transition to a new commercial organisational structure as part of the Group Optimisation programme.
The resultant effect of these restructuring activities is that the Group is now engaged in a single business activity, being the development, manufacture and sales of medical technology products and services.
Development, manufacturing, supply chain and central functions are managed globally for the Group as a whole.
Sales are managed through six geographical selling regions, with each having a president who is responsible for the commercial review of that region.
The Commercial Operations team CommOps, comprises geographical presidents and certain heads of function and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer CEO.
CommOps is the body through which the CEO uses the authority delegated to him by the Board of Directors to manage the operations and performance of the Group.
All significant operating decisions regarding the allocation and prioritisation of the Groups resources and assessment of the Groups performance are made by CommOps, and whilst the members have individual responsibility for the implementation of decisions within their respective areas, it is at the CommOps level that these decisions are made.
Accordingly, CommOps is considered to be the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
In making decisions about the prioritisation and allocation of the Groups resources, CommOps review financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole and determines the best allocation of resources to Group-wide projects.
This information is prepared substantially on the same basis as the Groups IFRS financial statements aside from the adjustments described in Note 2.2.
In assessing performance, CommOps also consider financial information presented on a geographical selling region and product franchise basis for revenue.
Financial information for corporate and functional costs is presented on a Group-wide basis.
The types of products and services offered by the Groups global business segment are as follows: Sports Medicine Joint Repair, which offers surgeons a broad array of instruments, technologies and implants necessary to perform minimally invasive surgery of the joints: Arthroscopy Enabling Technologies, which offers healthcare providers a variety of technologies such as fluid management equipment for surgical access, high definition cameras, digital image capture, scopes, light sources and monitors to assist with visualisation inside the joints, radio frequency wands, electromechanical and mechanical blades, and hand instruments for removing damaged tissue: Trauma & Extremities, consisting of internal and external devices used in the stabilisation of severe fractures and deformity correction procedures: Other Surgical Businesses, which includes gynaecological instrumentation as well as various products and technologies to assist in surgical treatment of the ear, nose and throat: Knee Implants, which offers an innovative range of products for specialised knee replacement procedures: Hip Implants, which offers a range of specialist products for reconstruction of the hip joint: Advanced Wound Care, which includes products for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, including leg, diabetic and pressure ulcers, burns and post-operative wounds: Advanced Wound Devices, which consists of traditional and single-use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and hydrosurgery systems: and Advanced Wound Bioactives, which includes biologics and other bioactive technologies that provide unique approaches to debridement and dermal repair regeneration.
The segment information is prepared in conformity with the accounting policies of the Group and the accounting standard IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The segment profit measure reported to CommOps for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment is trading profit before interest, and related income tax expense and excludes the effects of non-recurring income and expenditure from one-off items as discussed in Note 2.2 below.
Group financing including interest receivable and payable is managed on a net basis outside of the business segment.
The results and other information as required of the single segment are shown below.
Segment information from the prior year has been restated to conform to the one global segment view, in order to provide more meaningful comparison.
com 121 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS 2.1 Revenue by business segment and geography ACCOUNTING POLICY Revenue comprises sales of products and services to third parties at amounts invoiced net of trade discounts and rebates, excluding taxes on revenue.
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised upon transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
This is generally when goods are delivered to customers.
There is no significant revenue associated with the provision of discrete services.
Sales of inventory located at customer premises and available for customers immediate use are recognised when notification is received that the product has been implanted or used.
Appropriate provisions for returns, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from revenue.
Rebates comprise retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on attainment of certain levels of purchases from the Group.
These are accrued over the course of the arrangement based on estimates of the level of business expected and adjusted at the end of the arrangement to reflect actual volumes.
Segment revenue reconciles to statutory revenues and other income from continuing operations as follows: 2015 2014 2013 $ million $ million $ million Reportable segment revenue Revenue from external customers 4,634 4,617 4,351 The table below shows sales revenue by product type from continuing operations: 2015 2014 2013 $ million $ million $ million Sales revenue by product from continuing operations Sports Medicine Joint Repair 606 576 496 Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies 573 542 441 Trauma & Extremities 497 506 486 Other Surgical Businesses 205 147 74 Knee Implants 883 873 865 Hip Implants 604 654 653 Advanced Wound Care 755 805 843 Advanced Wound Bioactives 344 322 280 Advanced Wound Devices 167 192 213 Consolidated sales revenue from continuing operations 4,634 4,617 4,351 In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is based on location of Smith & Nephew businesses: 2015 2014 2013 $ million $ million $ million Geographical segment revenue United Kingdom 301 299 293 United States of America 2,217 2,012 1,862 Other 2,116 2,306 2,196 Consolidated sales revenue from continuing operations 4,634 4,617 4,351 Major customers No single customer generates revenue greater than 10% of the consolidated entitys total revenues.

com 124 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 3 Operating profit ACCOUNTING POLICIES Research and development Research expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Internal development expenditure is only capitalised if the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible Assets have been satisfied.
The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development of new products mean that in most cases development costs should not be capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval from the appropriate regulatory body.
Payments to third parties for research and development projects are accounted for based on the substance of the arrangement.
If the arrangement represents outsourced research and development activities the payments are generally expensed except in limited circumstances where the respective development expenditure would be capitalised under the principles established in IAS 38.
By contrast, the payments are capitalised if the arrangement represents consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party.
Capitalised development expenditures are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

These amounts were fully matched by the fair value gains or losses on currency swaps held to manage this currency risk.
5 Taxation ACCOUNTING POLICY The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is considered probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any time the Group has years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take many years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of the provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for: temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future: on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill: and on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised within other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

The 2015 prior period deferred taxation adjustments mainly relate to a reclassification from current to deferred taxation and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The tax charge was reduced by $130m 2014 $71m reduction and 2013 $40m reduction as a consequence of acquisition-related costs, restructuring and rationalisation costs, amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles, and legal and other.
Factors affecting future tax charges The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world and is subject to factors that may affect future tax charges, including tax rate changes, tax legislation changes and resolution of tax audits and disputes.
At any given time the Group has years outstanding in various countries and is involved in tax audits and disputes, some of which may take several years to resolve.
In 2015, the UK Government enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK statutory corporation tax to 19.0% from 1 April 2017 and 18.0% from 1 April 2020.
Overseas taxation is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the basic earnings per share for the effect of conversion to ordinary shares associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options and awards granted to employees.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability.
Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure.
The Group has identified the following items as those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: acquisitions and disposals related items including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets and impairments: significant restructuring events: significant gains and losses arising from legal disputes and significant uninsured losses: and taxation thereon.

com 130 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 7 Property, plant and equipment ACCOUNTING POLICIES Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in profit or loss.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment is 320 years and for buildings is 2050 years.
Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are available for use.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to complete are capitalised based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs.
All other finance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of assets The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

com 132 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 8 Goodwill ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually.
The CGUs identified by management are at the aggregated product franchise levels of Reconstruction, Other Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management, in the way the business is managed and the way the core assets are used to generate cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred.
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

Following the completion of the Groups business reorganisation in 2015, management has identified four CGUs in applying the provisions of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Reconstruction, Other Surgical Devices, Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives.
For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, the Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives CGUs have been aggregated Advanced Wound Management, as this is the level at which goodwill is monitored and level at which the economic benefits relating to the goodwill within these CGUs is realised.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs as follows: 2015 $ million Reconstruction 557 Other Surgical Devices 1,140 Advanced Wound Management 315 2,012 Impairment reviews were performed in September 2015 and 2014 by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
These were updated during December, taking into account any significant events that occurred between September and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in-line with the Groups strategic planning process.
In determining the growth rates used in the calculations of the value-in-use, management considered annual revenue growth.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year.
The discount rates used in the value-in-use calculations reflect managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
8.1 Reconstruction CGU The sales growth and trading profit margin used in the value-in-use calculation for the Reconstruction CGU reflects managements distinctive orthopaedic reconstruction strategy, which combines cutting edge innovation, disruptive business models and a strong Emerging Markets platform to drive outperformance.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 2.1% to 8.6% for the various components of the Reconstruction CGU.
The weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 5.6%.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Reconstruction CGU value-in-use calculation is 10.3%.
com 133 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 8.2 Other Surgical Devices CGU The value-in-use calculation for the Other Surgical Devices CGU reflects growth rates and trading profit margins consistent with managements strategy to rebalance Smith & Nephew towards higher growth areas such as, for example, Sports Medicine.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 1.2% to 13.5% for the various components of the Other Surgical Devices CGU.
Thepre-tax discount rate used in the Other Surgical Devices CGU value-in-use calculation is 10.3%.
8.3 Advanced Wound Management CGU The aggregated Advanced Wound Management CGU comprises the Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives CGUs.
In performing the value-in-use calculation for this combined CGU, management considered the Groups focus across the wound product franchises, focusing on widening access to the customer, the higher added value sectors of healing chronic wounds and tissue repair using bioactives, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 3.8% to 20.5% for the various components of the Advanced Wound Management CGU.
The weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 6.7%.
Thepre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced Wound Management CGU value-in-use calculation is 10.3%.
8.4 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions used in value-in-use calculations The calculations of value-in-use for the identified CGUs are most sensitive to changes in discount and growth rates.
Managements consideration of these sensitivities is set out below: Growth of market and market share Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share.
The value-inuse calculations shows that if the assumed long-term growth rates were reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of each CGU would still be greater than its carrying value.
Discount rate Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the value-in-use calculations.
This sensitivity analysis shows that for the recoverable amount of each CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 23.2% for the Reconstruction CGU, 28.1% for the Other Surgical Devices CGU and 28.5% for the Advanced Wound Products CGU.
9 Intangible assets ACCOUNTING POLICIES Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights are initially measured at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination referred to as acquisition intangibles is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on its nature.
Internally-generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets.
Software that is integral to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment.
Impairment of intangible assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
If actual results should differ, orchanges in expectations should arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

The carrying values of intangible assets are considered for indicators of impairment and where an indicator, such as declining revenues, is present a full impairment review comparing value in use to carrying value is performed.
Two product-related intangible assets were determined to have value in use below carrying value, resulting in an impairment charge being recognised.
The impairment charge primarily relates to $40m from Oasis, calculated using a discount rate of 11.2% 2014 10.2%, a product right acquired with the Healthpoint acquisition in 2012.
During the year, continued reimbursement pressure has resulted in revenues not increasing at the previously expected rate.
The remaining carrying value of $45m is supported by the present value of anticipated future cash flows.

The Group has an investments in an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their nature have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
These investments are classed as available-for-sale carried at fair value.
The fair value of these investments are based on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market: and non-marketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price: prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value.
Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities.
Objective evidence would includea significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost less any impairment loss previously recognised.
Impairment losses are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in other reserves to profit or loss.

11 Investments in associates ACCOUNTING POLICY Investments in associates, being those entities over which the Group has a significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a jointventure, are accounted for using the equity method, with the Group recording its share of the associates profit and loss and other comprehensive income.
The Groups share of associates profit or loss is included in one separate income statement line and is calculated afterdeduction of their respective taxes.
At 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, the Group holds 49% of Bioventus LLC Bioventus.
Bioventus is a limited liability company operating as a partnership.
The Companys headquarters is located in Durham, North Carolina, US.
Bioventus focuses its medical product development around its core competencies of orthobiologic therapies and orthopaedic diagnostics from which it develops and markets clinically proven orthopaedic therapies and diagnostic tools, including osteoarthritis pain treatments, bone growth stimulators and ultrasound devices.
Bioventus sells bone stimulation devices and is a provider of osteoarthritis injection therapies.
The loss after taxation recognised in the income statement relating to Bioventus was $18m 2014 loss after taxation $2m.
Of this loss, $11m relates to a change in the acquisition fair value of the OsteoAMP liability.
In November 2015, the Group contributed $25m of capital to Bioventus as part of a rights issue, following which the Groups shareholding in Bioventus remained at 49%.
The rights issue was to fund the acquisition of Biostructures LLC, a leading medical device company focused on developing bioresorbable bone graft products for a broad range of spinal and orthopaedic fusion procedures.
The carrying amount of this investment was reviewed for impairment as at the balance sheet date.
For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable amount of this investment was based on its fair value less cost to sell, estimated using discounted cash flows.
The fair value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value based on the inputs and valuation technique used.

12 Inventories ACCOUNTING POLICY Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis.
Raw materials and bought-in finished goods are valued at purchase price.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost.
Inventory acquired as part of a business acquisition is valued at selling price less costs of disposal and a profit allowance for selling efforts.
Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery.
They are recorded as inventory until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between three and five years.
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use referred to as consignment inventory.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage.
This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness of inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

The increase in reserves of $5m in the year comprised $17m charged to the reserve on the write-down of inventory and $3m attributable to business combinations during the year, partially offset by foreign exchange movements of $15m.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of goods sold amounted to $961m 2014 $1,013m, 2013 $958m.
In addition, $73m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods sold resulting from inventory write-offs 2014 $55m, 2013 $73m.
Notwithstanding inventory acquired within acquisitions, no inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.

They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly reviewed.
Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case.
Significant receivables are regularly reviewed and monitored at Group level.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers and geographies.
Furthermore, the Groups principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium-term cash forecasts, having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities.
The Group has available committed facilities of $2.4bn 2014 $2.5bn.
The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is either at fixed or floating rates.
Floating rates are typically based on the LIBOR or other reference rate relevant to the term and currency concerned.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under its principal facility agreements.
These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period.
As of 31 December 2015, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
The facilities are also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.

15.5 Finance leases ACCOUNTING POLICY Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
com 141 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 2015 2014 $ million $ million Within one year 3 3 After one and within two years 3 3 After two and within three years 3 3 After three and within four years 3 3 After four and within five years 3 After five years Total minimum lease payments 12 15 Discounted by imputed interest 2 3 Present value of minimum lease payments 10 12 Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m 2014 $2m due within one year, $8m 2014 $10m due between one to five years and $nil 2014 $nil due after five years.
Liquidity and capital resources The Groups policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and facilities to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held $102m 2014 $65m, 2013 $126m in cash net of bank overdrafts.
The Group had committed facilities available of $2,425m at 31 December 2015 of which $1,425m was drawn.
Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within one year using available cash and drawing down on the longer-term facilities.
In addition, the Group has finance lease commitments of $10m.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group refinanced its principal banking facilities.
The Group signed a new five-year committed $1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 2019.
This maturity date has since been extended to March 2020.
In April 2015, the Group signed a new three year, $300m bilateral term loan with one of its relationship banks.
The new term loan has a maturity date of April 2018.
The proceeds of this new loan were used to repay the remaining outstanding amount on the committed term loan used to fund the ArthroCare acquisition.
The principal variations in the Groups borrowing requirements result from the timing of dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals of businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital fluctuations.
Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure needs and its working capital funding for 2016, as well as its other known or expected commitments or liabilities, can be met from its existing resources and facilities.
The Groups net debt decreased from $1,613m at the beginning of 2015 to $1,361m at the end of 2015, representing an overall decrease of $252m.
The Groups planned future contributions are considered adequate to cover the current underfunded position in the Groups defined benefit plans.
16 Financial instruments and risk management ACCOUNTING POLICY Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year end.
Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to convert fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings are accounted for as fair value hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred.
com 142 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 16 Financial instruments and risk management continued 16.1 Foreign exchange exposures The Group operates in over 100 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within 12 months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further 12-month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1.9bn 2014 $1.5bn.
Based on the Groups net borrowings as at 31 December 2015, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would decrease by $1m 2014 decrease by $6m as the Group held a higher amount of foreign denominated cash than foreign denominated borrowings.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2015 would have been $42m lower 2014 $37m.
Similarly, if the Euro was to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2015 would have been $16m higher 2014 $26m.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts would be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2015 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Groups policy is to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
The net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant.
In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.
16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency and interest rate swaps which are at floating rates.
When required the Group uses interest rate derivatives to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
These interest rate derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, with the fair value of the interest rate derivatives recorded in the balance sheet.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to reduce the overall level of fixed rate debt, within parameters set by the Board.
When used in this way, interest rate derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges.
The fair value movement of the derivative is offset in the income statement against the fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt.
Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2015, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $6m 2014 $6m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2015 was $33m 2014 $49m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash at bank at 31 December 2015 was $120m 2014 $93m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

There were no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one, three or six-month LIBOR or other reference rate relevant to the currency concerned.

com 144 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 16 Financial instruments and risk management continued 16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities ACCOUNTING POLICY Measurement of fair values A number of the Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets acquired in a business combination see Note 21.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable data unobservable inputs.
The Group recognises transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.
It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to quoted market forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of currency swaps is determined by reference to quoted market spot rates.
As a result, foreign forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
The valuation model considers the present value of expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The expected payment is determined by considering the possible scenarios, which relate to the achievement of established milestones and targets, the amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each scenario.
As a result, contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during 2015 and 2014.
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months, the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
As the Groups long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not available, their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year end.
com 146 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 17 Provisions and contingencies ACCOUNTING POLICY In the normal course of business the Group is involved in various legal disputes.
Provisions are made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the losses can be reasonably estimated.
Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties, legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
For the purpose of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group takes the discounted future lease payments if any, net of expected rental income.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A provision for rationalisation is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.

Following the settlement of the majority of US metal-on-metal hip claims discussed below the Group has estimated a provision of $185m 2014 $nil relating to the present value at 31 December of the estimated costs to resolve all other known and anticipated metal-on-metal hip claims.
The estimated value of the provision has been determined using an actuarial model.
Given the inherent uncertainty in assumptions relating to factors such as the number of claims and outcome the actual costs may differ significantly from this estimate.
The provision does not include any possible insurance recoveries on these claims or legal fees associated with defending claims.
The Group carries considerable product liability insurance, and will continue to defend claims vigorously.
Furthermore, for the year to 31 December 2015, included within legal and other provisions are: A provision of $5m 2014: $10m relating to the RENASYS distribution hold.
A provision of $4m 2014: $7m relating to the HP802 programme which was stopped during the fourth quarter of 2014.
The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various other litigation matters.
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within five years of 31 December 2015 and none are treated as financial instruments.
com 147 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 17.2 Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages.
The outcome of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them is likely to result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated.
There is no assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations in the period in which they are realised.
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
A charge of$154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims.
Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements of such claims, and almost all have been resolved.
The aggregate cost at 31 December 2015 related to this matter is approximately $205m.
The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims.
The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability.
However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters.
In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee, for which a trial has not yet begun.
An additional $22m was received during 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
17.3 Legal proceedings Product liability claims The Group faces claims from time to time for alleged defects in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products from the market.
Such claims are endemic to the medical device industry.
The Group maintains product liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles that management believes are reasonable.
All policies contain exclusions and limitations, however, and there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
In recent years, there has been heightened concern about possible adverse effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, and the Group has incurred and will continue to incur expenses to defend claims in this area.
As of February 2016, and giving effect to the US settlement described below, approximately 718 such claims were pending with the Group around the world, of which 388 had given rise to pending legal proceedings.
The Group has requested indemnity from its product liability insurers for most of these metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
Most claims relate to the Groups Birmingham Hip Resurfacing BHR product and its two modular metal-on-metal components: the Birmingham Hip Modular Head BHMH and the optional metal liner component of the R3 Acetabular System R3ML.
The BHMH and R3ML are no longer on the market: the R3ML was withdrawn in 2012 and the BHMH was phased out in 2014.
In 2015, the Group ceased offering smaller sizes of the BHR and restricted instructions for BHR use in female patients.
These actions were taken to ensure that the BHR is only used in those patient groups where it continues to demonstrate strong performance.
These represent the vast majority of current patients.
In 2015 the Groups US subsidiary settled the majority of its US metal-on-metal hip lawsuits, without admitting liability.
Insurance receipts covered more than half of the gross settlement, with the net cash cost being $25 million.
These cases had been consolidated in a state court in Memphis, Tennessee and principally related to the Groups modular metal-on-metal hip components, which are no longer on the market.
Litigation outcomes are difficult to predict and defence costs can be significant.
The Group takes care to monitor the clinical evidence relating to its metal hip implant products and ensure that its product offerings are designed to serve patients interests.
Business practice investigations Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities.
From time to time authorities undertake investigations of the Groups activities to verify compliance.
In January 2014, before agreeing to be acquired by the Group, ArthroCare announced a settlement of charges by the US Department of Justice relating to securities fraud in which certain members of prior management were implicated.
ArthroCare paid a $30m fine and signed a deferred prosecution agreement that imposed reporting, compliance and other requirements on ArthroCare for a two-year term.
That agreement expired in January 2016, and the related complaint against ArthroCare was dismissed.
Intellectual property disputes The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and other intellectual property matters.
These disputes are being heard in courts in the US and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine patents.
Outcomes are rarely certain and costs are often significant.
The Group won a jury verdict in the US district court for Oregon against Arthrex Inc. in 2011 for infringement of the Groups patent relating to suture anchors.
A number of issues have been disputed and appealed since the case was first filed in 2003: Arthrex paid $99m in June 2015, and most of that award net of various expenses was recognised in the Groups trading profit at that time.
A follow-up trial asserting the same patent against additional Arthrex products is in progress in the Oregon court.
Arthrex asserted other patents against the Group in 2014 and 2015 in the US district court for the Eastern District of Texas.
Other matters In April 2009, the Group was served with a subpoena by the US Department of Justice in Massachusetts requiring the production of documents from 1995 to 2009 associated with the marketing and sale of a bone growth stimulation product that the Group has since divested.
Similar subpoenas had been served on a number of competitors in the bone growth stimulator market, and a qui tam or whistle-blower complaint had been filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts.
The Group cooperated with the government inquiry, defended the qui tam action, and agreed in principle to settle the latter in 2015 without admitting any liability.
com 148 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 18 Retirement benefit obligations ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group sponsors defined benefit plans in a number of countries.
A defined benefit pension plan defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, which is dependent on various factors such as age, years of service and final salary.
The Groups obligation is calculated separately for each plan by discounting the estimated future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The fair value of any plan assets is deducted to arrive at the net liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on the plan assets net of the costs ofmanaging the plan assets.
The Group recognises these immediately in other comprehensive income OCI and all other expenses, such as service cost, net interest cost, administration costs and taxes, are recognised in the income statement.
A number of key assumptions are made when calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the balance sheet asset and liabilities, operating profit and finance income costs.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
The discount rate is based on the yield at the reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of AA, denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and have a maturity profile approximately the same as the Groups obligations.
In determining these assumptions management take into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liability asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third party financial provider.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.

Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions and the assets are held by separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In countries where there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered by management to be adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee.
The Groups two major defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and US.
Both these plans were closed to new employees in 2003 and defined contribution plans are offered to new joiners.
The US Plan was closed to future accrual in March 2014.
The UK Plan operates under trust law and responsibility for its governance lies with a Board of Trustees.
This Board is composed of representatives of the Group, plan participants and an independent trustee, who act on behalf of members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The UK Plans assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases on benefits in payment are dependent on inflation.
The main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the UK Plan are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increase and the actual longevity of the membership.
There is no legislative minimum funding requirement in the UK, however the Group has agreed with the Board of Trustees to pay a schedule of supplementary payments see Note 18.8.
The Trust Deed of the UK Plan states that any surplus is ultimately accessible by the Group as a refund.
As a result the Group has recognised a surplus for the UK Plan of $7m in 2015.
The US Plan is governed by a US Pension Committee which is composed of both plan participants and representatives of the Group.
In the US, the Pension Protection Act 2006 established both a minimum required contribution and a maximum deductible contribution.
Failure to contribute at least the minimum required amount will subject the Company to significant penalties, and contributions in excess of the maximum deductible have negative tax consequences.
The minimum funding requirement is intended to fully fund the present value of accrued benefits over seven years.

The US and UK Plan assets are invested in a diversified range of industries across a broad range of geographies.
These assets include liability matching assets and annuity policies purchased by the trustees of each plan, which aim to match the benefits to be paid to certain members from the plan and therefore remove the investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to those liabilities.
In December 2014, the low risk asset portfolio held by the UK Plan was transferred into liability driven investments LDI in order to maintain the same level of hedging against interest rate and inflation risks.
The UK Plan also has an insurance contract with Rothesay Life covering a subset of the UK Plan pensioner liabilities.
The terms of this policy definethat the contract value exactly matches the amount and timing of the pensioner obligations covered by the contract.
In accordance with IAS19REmployee Benefits, the fair value of the insurance contract is deemed to be the present value of the related obligations which is discounted at the AA corporate bond rate.

com 153 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 18.7 Risk The pension plans expose the Group to the following risks: Interest rate risk Volatility in financial markets can change the calculations of the obligation significantly as the calculation of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in the bond yield will increase the measure of plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by increases in the value ofmatching plan assets such as bonds and insurance contracts.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments in order to reduce interest rate risk.
Inflation risk The UK Plan is linked to inflation.
A high rate of inflation will lead to a higher liability.
This risk is managed by holding inflation-linked bonds and an inflation-linked insurance contract in respect of some of the obligation.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments in order to reduce inflation risk.
During 2015, the Trustees of the UK Plan offered eligible retired and deferred members three benefit options which would provide them with greater flexibility to manage their final benefit.
The three options further minimised the exposure of the UK Plan to inflation risk and were: an option to exchange future increases on pension benefits for a higher level of pension with no increases: an option to take a transfer and draw their pension in a more flexible form: and an option to take a transfer in excess of a standard cash equivalent transfer which could be taken to another pension arrangement.
The US Plan has been closed to future accrual which eliminates the exposure to this risk.
Investment risk If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the plan deficit.
In the UK, this risk is partially managed by a portfolio of liability matching assets and a bulk annuity, together with a dynamic fide-risking policy to switch growth assets into liability matching assets over time.
The US Plan has a dynamic fide-risking policy to shift plan assets into longer-term stable asset classes.
The policy established 10 pre-determined funded status levels and when each trigger point is reached, the plan assets are re-balanced accordingly.
Longevity risk The present value of the plans defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity risk, has entered into an insurance contract which covers aportion of pensioner obligations.
The three options offered to members in the UK during 2015 further minimised the exposure to longevity risk see Inflation risk above.
Salary risk The calculation of the defined benefit obligation uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants.
Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The exposure to salary risk in the US has been eliminated with the closure of the US Plan to future accrual.
18.8 Funding A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the Trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required.
Employer contributions rates, based on these full valuations, are agreed between the trustees of each plan and the Group.
The assumptions used in the funding actuarial valuations may differ from those assumptions above.
UK Plan The most recent full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is being undertaken as at 30 September 2015.
This included supplementary payments of $29m 2014 $23m, 2013 $31m.
The Group has currently agreed to pay supplementary payments until 2017 and the agreed supplementary contribution for 2016 is $29m.
A new schedule of contributions will be agreed in 2016.
US Plan Full actuarial valuations were performed annually for the US Plan with the last undertaken as at 20 September 2013 before the closure of the Plan to future accrual.
Contributions to the US Plan were $20m 2014 $22m, 2013 $20m which included supplementary payments of $20m.

com 154 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 19 Equity ACCOUNTING POLICY Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognised as a deduction from equity.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase inequity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.
They are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights and effectively have no value.
These rights are summarised as follows: The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company: The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Companys assets on a winding up or other distribution except that after the return of the nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the deferred shares and the distribution of a further $1,000 in respect of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a deferred share foreach deferred share held by him an amount equal to the nominal value of the deferred share: The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company: and The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves without obtaining the consent of the holders of the deferred shares.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements.
The Group reviews its capital structure on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.

com 157 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 21 Acquisitions and disposals ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.
The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
21.1 Acquisitions Year ended 31 December 2015 During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group acquired its distributor in Colombia and its distributor and a manufacturer in Russia.
The acquisitions are deemed to be business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The aggregated total estimated fair value of the consideration is $68m and included $23m of contingent consideration and $13m through the settlement of working capital commitments.
The fair values shown below have been determined on a provisional basis.
If new information is obtained within the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised.

The provisional aggregated estimate of goodwill arising on the acquisitions is $34m.
This is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the transactions, including the assembled workforces, which have been transferred as part of the acquisitions.
The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The contribution to revenue and attributable profit from these acquisitions for the year ended 31 December 2015 was immaterial.
If the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the year, their contributions to revenue and attributable profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 would also have been immaterial.
Year ended 31 December 2014 Acquisition of ArthroCare On 29 May 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of ArthroCare Corporation, an innovative medical device company with a highly complementary sports medicine portfolio.
The purchase price was $48.25 per share, paid in cash with the fair value of the total consideration equalling $1,715m.
The acquisition was financed through existing debt facilities and cash balances, including an existing $1bn revolving credit facility and a new two-year $1.4bn term loan facility, established in February 2014.
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The acquisition accounting was completed during 2015.
The fair values shown below include measurement period adjustments recognised during the period.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is $829m.
It relates to the value of the additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including synergies and the assembled workforce.

This gave rise to a pre-tax profit of $28m after amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
Had ArthroCare been acquired on 1 January 2014, the Groups revenues for 2014 would have been $147m higher and pre-tax profit would have been $5m higher.
Acquisition of Brazilian distributor On 17 March 2014, the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities related to the distribution business for its sports medicine, orthopaedic reconstruction, and trauma products in Brazil.
The acquisition was deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration was $31m and included deferred consideration of $26m and $5m in relation tothe settlement of working capital commitments.
The deferred consideration was subsequently settled during the second quarter of 2014.
As at the acquisition date, the fair value of the net assets acquired, which includes measurement period adjustments recognised during the period, was $16m.
This includes trade and other receivables of $12m, identifiable intangible assets of $16m, inventory of $4m, property, plant and equipment of $2m, trade payables of $1m, provisions of $5m, current tax payable of $4m and deferred tax liabilities of $8m.
As a result, the goodwill arising on the acquisition was $15m.

For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is calculated using appropriate option pricing models.
The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an expense, with a corresponding increase in retained earnings.
Employee plans The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002 adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002 the Save As You Earn SAYE plan, the Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002, Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2002, Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2012 the Save As You Earn SAYE 2012 plan adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012, Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2012 adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012 and Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2012 adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012 are together termed the Employee Plans.
The SAYE and SAYE 2012 plans are available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service.
The schemes enable employees to save up to 250 per month on plans up to 2014 and 500 per month from 2015 onwards and give them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved.
The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the ordinary shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation.
The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002 and Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2012 are available to employees in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Employees in Malaysia and Costa Rica became eligible to join the plan in 2015.
Puerto Rico participants were eligible to receive options under the International Plans up to 2011 and are eligible to receive phantom options from 2013 onwards.
The Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plans were available to all employees in France up to 2012.
The International and French plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the SAYE plans.
Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plans quarterly purchase period to the market price, through a regular savings plan.
Executive plans The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001, the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004 and the Smith & Nephew Global Share Plan 2010 adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010 are together termed the Executive Plans.
Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or ordinary shares.
For Executive Plans adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an ordinary share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or ordinary share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010, the market value is the closing price of an ordinary share or ADS on the last trading day prior to the grant date.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of options granted from 2001 is subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions.
Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
With effect from 2008, options granted under the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan was open to certain employees in the US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
The Global Share Plan 2010 is open to employees globally.
The 2004 Plan was open to Senior Executives only.
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant.
All share option plans are settled in shares.
From 2012 onwards, Senior Executives were granted share awards instead of share options and from 2013 executives were granted conditional share awards instead of share options.
The awards vest 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year subject to continued employment.
There are no performance conditions for executives.
Vesting for Senior Executives is subject to personal performance levels.
The market value used to calculate the number of awards is the closing price of an ordinary share on the last trading day prior to the grant date.

Options granted under Employee Plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: Employee Plans 2015 2014 2013 Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 2.0 1 Expected volatility % 25.0 20.0 25.0 2 Risk free interest rate % 1.3 1.3 1.3 Expected life in years 3.8 3.9 3.8 1 Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options.
2 The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency.
Share-based payments long-term incentive plans In 2004, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives.
The plan included a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry.
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved, participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
This plan was designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, up to one-third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee was compulsorily deferred into shares which vested, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one-third each year.
No further performance conditions applied to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards were granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all Executives other than Executive Directors.
Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below.
From 2012, Deferred Bonus Plan and GSP 2010 options for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives were replaced by Equity Incentive Awards EIA.
EIA are designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
EIA will vest, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one-third each year, subject to continued employment and personal performance.
No further performance conditions apply to the EIA.
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
A correlation of 35% 2014 40%, 2013 40% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors.
The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of Free Cash Flow growth, Revenue in Emerging & International Markets and the Groups TSR performance over the three-year performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the Executive scheme assumptions disclosed earlier in this Note.
