Taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.
Accounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using UK and foreign tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Groups assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates and, specifically, in India these are usually resolved through the Indian legal system.
We consider each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, hold provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise.
However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Groups overall profitability and cash flows in future periods.

126 Vodafone Group Plc Overview Strategy review Performance Governance Financials Additional information Annual Report 2015 At 31 March 2015, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 610 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 104 64 87,246 87,414 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 1,124 543 16,084 17,751 1,228 607 103,330 105,165 At 31 March 2014, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 610 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 274 461 79,115 79,850 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 1,281 519 26,318 28,118 1,555 980 105,433 107,968 Deferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg Included in the table above are losses of 70,576 million 2014: 73,734 million that have arisen in Luxembourg companies, principally as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
These losses do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of 20,755 million 2014: 18,150 million has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
The Luxembourg companies income is derived from the Groups internal financing and procurement and roaming activities.
We have reviewed the latest forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond the forecast period under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The assessment also considered whether the structure of the Group would continue to allow the generation of taxable income.
Based on this, we conclude that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable income in the future.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 55 to 65 years.
A 5%10% change in the forecast income in Luxembourg would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by between two and four years.
Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of losses, including the period over which the losses are utilised.
During the current year we recognised an additional deferred tax asset of 3,341 million relating to the historic tax losses in Luxembourg as a consequence of the financing arrangements for the acquisition of Grupo Corporativo Ono, S. A.
We also recognised an additional deferred tax asset of 2,127 million arising from the revaluation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements.
We also have 7,642 million 2014: 7,642 million of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany The Group has tax losses of 13,600 million 2014: 15,290 million in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000.
The losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of 2,086 million 2014: 2,344 million has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the German business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
We have reviewed the latest forecasts for the German business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 32 to 37.
In the period beyond the five year forecast, we have reviewed the profits inherent in the value in use calculations and based on these and our expectations for the German business, we believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 10 to 15 years.
A 5%10% change in the profits of the German business would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by up to one year.
The recognition of the additional deferred tax assets in Luxembourg and Germany in the year ended 31 March 2014 was triggered by the agreement to dispose of the US group whose principal asset was its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless, which removed significant uncertainty over the future structure of the Group including the continuation of future income streams in Luxembourg and the availability of the losses in Germany.
Other tax losses During the year, the Group acquired Grupo Corporativo Ono, S. A. and which had tax losses of 2,375 million in Spain and which are available to offset against the future profits of the Spanish business.
A deferred tax asset of 603 million 2014: nil has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the Spanish business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
We have reviewed the latest forecasts for the Spanish business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 32 to 37.
In the period beyond the five year forecast, we have reviewed the profits inherent in the value in use calculations and based on these and our expectations for the Spanish business, we believe it is probable the losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next eight to ten years.
A 5%10% change in the profits of the Spanish business would not significantly alter the utilisation period.
We have losses amounting to 6,735 million 2014: 6,651 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
We recognised a deferred tax asset 2014: 442 million of these losses in the prior year.
The remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group.
There are also 310 million 2014: 339 million of unrecognised other temporary differences.
