The total impairment of goodwill in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is a charge of 22 million as management determined that goodwill in subsidiaries of 13 million in Hong Kong and 9 million in Italy was impaired.
Impairment tests on goodwill were conducted as described in note 16 b.
Movements in contingent consideration in 2014 relate to contingent consideration received in respect of acquisitions of subsidiaries made prior to 1 January 2010. b Goodwill allocation and impairment testing A summary of the goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives allocated to cash generating units is presented below.

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the cash generating unit unless otherwise stated.
Long-term business Value in use is calculated as an actuarially determined appraisal value, based on the embedded value of the business calculated in accordance with market consistent embedded value MCEV principles, together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If the embedded value of the business tested is sufficient to demonstrate goodwill recoverability on its own, then it is not necessary to estimate the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If required, the present value of expected profits arising from future new business written over a given period is calculated on an MCEV basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management.
These plans reflect managements best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.
176 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 176 | Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2015 IFRS Financial statements 16 Goodwill continued Future new business profits for the remainder of the given period beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Expected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
Key Assumptions Future new business Future new business Embedded value basis profits growth rate profits discount rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % % % Italy long-term business MCEV MCEV 1.3 2.0 8.1 8.4 Spain long-term business MCEV MCEV 1.5 1.5 10.0 10.0 For the goodwill in the UK Life long-term business that arose on the Friends Life acquisition, the embedded value of the business was sufficient to demonstrate goodwill recoverability on its own.
Therefore it was not necessary to estimate the present value of expected profits from future new business.
General insurance, health, fund management and other businesses Value in use is calculated as the discounted value of expected future profits of each business.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.
Cash flows beyond that three year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Future profits are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
Key assumptions Extrapolated future profits growth rate Future profits discount rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % % % United Kingdom general insurance and health 1.3 1.3 6.4 6.7 Ireland general insurance and health 1.3 2.5 1.3 6.1 5.9 Italy general insurance and health 1.3 2.0 6.5 7.8 6.8 7.9 France indefinite life intangible asset The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset has been assessed based on the fair value less costs to sell of the cash generating unit to which it relates.
The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of Avivas share of the subsidiary to which it relates.
Results of impairment testing The goodwill associated with the Italian long-term and general insurance cash generating units was reviewed in the first half of the year due to prevailing economic conditions in Italy.
As a result of revised estimates, management concluded that the goodwill was no longer fully recoverable.
Impairments of 6 million and 3 million were recognised in the Italian long-term and general insurance cash generating units respectively reducing the carrying values to their recoverable amounts.
Subsequently, management reviewed the goodwill at 31 December 2015 and concluded that no further impairment was required as the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.
The goodwill of 13 million associated with Hong Kong was fully impaired in the first half of the year as management concluded that goodwill was no longer recoverable based on revised estimates.
Other than the cash generating units noted above, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating units including goodwill.
Furthermore, a reasonably possible change in assumptions would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
