Assets and liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section four.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in section two.
3.1 Trade and other receivables Our trade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance.
Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for bad or doubtful debts.
4 31 March 31 March 2015 2014 US$m US$m Gross trade receivables 400 276 Impairment allowance 70 77 Net trade receivables 330 199 Other receivables 88 71 Prepayments and accrued income 153 146 Taxation and social security receivables 15 15 Loans to related parties 56 Amounts receivable from joint ventures and associates 1 2 Trade and other receivables current 643 433 Other receivables 31 46 Prepayments and accrued income 127 124 Other receivables non-current 158 170 Total trade and other receivables 801 603 The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables is equal to their carrying value.
There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of trade and other receivables presented.
Concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade receivables are small as the Group customer base is large and unrelated.
Receivables predominantly relate to retail customers, governments and corporate entities as well as other telecommunications operators.
Credit risk procedures vary depending on the size or type of customer.
These procedures include such activities as credit checks, payment history analysis and credit approval limits.
Based on these procedures, management assessed the credit quality of those receivables that are neither past due nor impaired as low risk.
There have been no significant changes to the composition of receivables counterparties within the Group that indicate this would change in the future.
During the periods presented there was a continued economic weakness in some of the markets in which the Group operated.
This would indicate an increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired.
However, management assessed this risk and, after providing valuation allowance where necessary, continued to support the assessment of credit quality as low risk.
An ageing analysis of the current trade receivables and current other receivables that are not impaired is as follows excludes prepayments and accrued income, taxation and social security and amounts receivable from joint ventures and associates : 31 March 31 March 2015 2014 US$m US$m Not yet due 68 20 Overdue 30 days or less 141 124 Overdue 31 to 60 days 48 39 Overdue 61 to 90 days 32 19 Overdue 91 days to 180 days 44 30 Overdue 181 days or more 85 38 Current trade receivables and current other receivables 418 270 114 Cable & Wireless Communications Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade and other receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
Due to the nature of the telecommunications industry, balances relating to interconnection with other carriers often have lengthy settlement periods.
Generally, interconnection agreements with major carriers result in both receivables and payables balances with the same counterparty.
Industry practice is that receivable and payable amounts relating to interconnection revenue and costs for a defined period are agreed between counterparties and settled on a net basis.
An analysis of movements in the trade receivables impairment allowance during the year is as follows: 2014 15 2013 14 US$m US$m At 1 April 77 78 Reclassification from held for sale 2 Business disposals 6 Bad debts written off 22 30 Increase in allowance 20 29 Exchange differences 1 At 31 March 70 77 In a small number of the Groups operations it is customary and practice to collect security deposits from customers as collateral.
These are recorded as liabilities within other payables.
3.2 Inventories Our inventory primarily consists of mobile handsets, equipment and consumables and is presented net of an allowance for obsolete products.
Accounting policy detailed in note 5.1.
6 Inventories of US$50 million 31 March 2014 US$36 million are presented net, after recording an allowance of US$7 million 31 March 2014 US$8 million made against slow moving or obsolete items.
The cost of inventories held for sale that were expensed within operating costs in 2014 15 was US$148 million 2013 14 US$140 million.
Inventories of the Group are not pledged as security or collateral against any of the Groups borrowings.
3.3 Trade and other payables Our trade and other payables mainly consist of amounts we owe to our suppliers that have been invoiced or are accrued.
They also include deferred income which is amounts we have billed to our customers where we have yet to provide the service.
Taxes and social security amounts are due in relation to our role as an employer.
31 March 31 March 2015 2014 US$m US$m Trade payables 199 141 Other tax and social security costs 17 6 Accruals 429 339 Deferred income 52 58 Other payables 74 68 Trade and other payables current 771 612 Accruals 13 1 Deferred income 333 23 Other payables 27 3 Trade and other payables non-current 373 26 Total trade and other payables 1,144 638 1 Deferred income of US$333 million primarily relates to long-term capacity sales contracts that were acquired through a business combination note 3.11.
Annual Report 2014 15 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.3 Trade and other payables continued There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of trade and other payables presented.
For liquidity risk exposure analysis purposes, the carrying amount of trade and other payables is the same as the contractual cash flows, with the contractual maturities of these financial liabilities all due in less than one year.
3.4 Impairment review Impairment occurs when the carrying value of an asset or group of assets is greater than the present value of the cash they are expected to generate.
We perform annual impairment reviews of the carrying value of goodwill.
We consider the carrying value of other assets at least annually.
If there are triggers that indicate an impairment of other assets is possible, we then perform a full impairment review.
US$78 million impairment charges were recorded in 2014 15 2013 14 US$nil.
5 Goodwill A review of the carrying value of goodwill has been performed as at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014.
In performing this review, the recoverable amount has been determined by reference to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of related businesses.
The key assumptions used by the Group in the calculation of value in use for its goodwill balances are the discount rate, revenue growth, operating cost margin and the level of capital expenditure required to maintain the network at its current level.
The Groups significant goodwill balances which are not impaired are discussed below: Carrying value at Terminal Continuing operations Reporting 31 March 2015 growth Pre-tax Year ended 31 March 2015 segment US$m rate discount rate 1 The Bahamas Telecommunications Company BTC 63 0% 10.0% Carrying value at Terminal Continuing operations Reporting 31 March 2014 growth Pre-tax Year ended 31 March 2014 segment US$m rate discount rate 1 The Bahamas Telecommunications Company BTC 63 0% 10.1% 2 Monaco Telecom group Monaco 292 Between 0% and 1.5% Between 8.0% and 27.0% 1 The Bahamas Telecommunications Company BTC : One relevant cash-generating unit CGU has been identified for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of the BTC business.
2 Monaco Telecom group: Three relevant CGUs were identified for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of Monaco Telecom domestic including the cable television business: international business and other services.
The value in use was determined for each CGU by discounting management forecasts of future cash flows based on the approved three-year business plan extrapolated at long-term growth rates at pre-tax discount rates dependent on the risk-adjusted cost of capital of the different parts of the business.
Management forecasts take account of the historical trading experience of the relevant business.
Sensitivity The value in use is sensitive to a number of input assumptions, in particular relating to net cash flow and the discount rates.
While the Group does not consider these scenarios to be reasonably possible, the value in use of the various CGUs in aggregate would not support the carrying value of the goodwill if: The Bahamas Telecommunications Company net cash flows decreased by more than US$15 million per year or the discount rate increased by more than 4% above the pre-tax discount rate.
Acquisitions On 31 March 2015, goodwill of US$2,034 million was recognised on the acquisition of Columbus.
As the acquisition was completed on the last day of the financial year, the goodwill has not been allocated to individual cash-generating units.
This allocation will be performed in 2015 16 with a corresponding impairment review.
During 2014 15, Cable & Wireless Panama acquired Sonitel which generated goodwill of US$13 million.
Sonitel was reviewed as part of the Panama CGU.
116 Cable & Wireless Communications Property, plant and equipment, indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangibles The indefinite lived intangibles acquired during 2014 15 of US$6 million relate to the Sonitel and Sonset brands from the Sonitel acquisition.
These brands are long-established in the Panama Central American IT marketplace.
As at 31 March 2015, no events or circumstances were identified during the year to indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment had been impaired.
However, as a result of the acquisition of Columbus and also technological upgrades as part of Project Marlin, certain specific assets in the Columbus overlapping markets and also islands which were upgraded as part of Project Marlin were reviewed for the impact on the carrying value of property, plant and equipment following those events.
As a result of the review, a write-off of US$49 million and impairment of US$78 million was recorded across the Caribbean islands noted below.

Annual Report 2014 15 117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.5 Intangible assets The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include goodwill, software, licences and operating agreements and customer contracts.
Within licence and operating agreements we include the cost of any acquired spectrum we use for our mobile services.
The cost of intangible assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been an acquisition of a business, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
Goodwill arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of the net assets of that business.
Goodwill is not amortised but subject to annual impairment tests.
The value of goodwill is an intangible value that comes from, for example, synergies we expect to gain and the value of its employees.
The value of other intangible assets reduces over the number of years the Group expects to use the asset via an annual amortisation charge.
Should an assets value fall below its carrying value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.

3.6 Property, plant and equipment The following section shows the physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
We make significant investments in network plant and equipment the technology and base stations required to operate our networks that form the majority of our tangible assets.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used useful economic life.
If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the Directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.

Of these amounts US$nil 2013 14 US$nil and US$nil 2013 14 US$nil respectively, relate to discontinued operations note 2.8.
120 Cable & Wireless Communications 3.7 Investment in joint ventures and associates We own interests in a number of associate operations, with a material interest in Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited TSTT.
These are companies where we either share control with one or more other parties or have a degree of ownership which gives us significant influence.
TSTT was equity accounted for up until 31 March 2015 when it was reclassified as held for sale due to the acquisition of Columbus.
Our share of joint venture and associates profit and net assets is recorded as a single line item in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of financial position, respectively.
The principal investments in joint ventures and associates at 31 March 2015 are shown in note 5.8.
Accounting policy detailed in note 1.2.

The investment represents 49% of the equity of TSTT.
The key assumptions used in determining the market value of 100% of the equity of TSTT were the maintainable earnings for TSTT based on actual 2015 results and comparable transaction multiples for the telecom industry.
A 10% variance in earnings would result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of US$13 million.
3.9 Provisions A provision is recognised by the Group where a liability exists, relating to events in the past and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it.
A feature of provisions is uncertainty over the timing or amount to be paid and therefore the amounts are estimated.
The main provisions we hold are for redundancies, asset retirement obligations and claims for legal matters.

Property Provision has been made for dilapidation costs and for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments or cost of exit in respect of vacant properties.
Unavoidable lease payments represent the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sublet.
The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
Redundancy Provision has been made for the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting date.
Amounts provided for during the year presented primarily relate to integration costs for merging the operations of the new combined group.
The provision is expected to be used in the next two years.
Amounts used relate to the regional transformation activities in the Caribbean.
Network and asset retirement obligations Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network capacity.
Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites, technical sites, mobile cell sites, domestic and subsea cabling.
This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the related asset on which the obligation arises.
Legal and other Legal and other provisions include amounts relating to specific legal claims against the Group together with amounts in respect of certain employee benefits and sales taxes.
The timing of the utilisation of the provision is uncertain and is largely outside the Groups control, for example, where matters are contingent upon litigation.
Legal proceedings are further discussed in note 5.5.
Annual Report 2014 15 123 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.10 Retirement benefits obligations We operate a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees.
The Groups largest defined benefit scheme is the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF in the UK.
We agreed a new funding agreement with the Trustees of the CWSF in May 2014.
11 The Group operates pension schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees.
These schemes include both defined benefit schemes, where retirement benefits are based on employees remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, where retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes.
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund Cable & Wireless Communications operates the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF.
This plan provides defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements for current and former employees of the Group.
The CWSF has been closed to new defined benefit members since 1998.
Regulatory framework and governance The assets of the CWSF are held in trustee-administered funds governed by UK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees.
Responsibility for the governance of the CWSF, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the Board of Trustees who must consult with the Group on such matters.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Group, plan participants and an independent Trustee in accordance with the CWSFs governing documents.
The weighted average duration of the total expected benefit payments from the CWSF is 16 years, and the weighted average duration of the expected uninsured benefit payments from the CWSF is 22 years.
Funding arrangements The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the CWSF was carried out by independent actuaries Towers Watson Limited as at 31 March 2013.
The March 2013 actuarial valuation showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to meet the future benefit accrual was 43.5% of pensionable earnings 38.5% employers and 5.0% employees.
This contribution rate will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation.
The terms of the CWSF Trust Deed also allow the Trustees or the Company to call for a valuation at any time.
In May 2014, the Group reached agreement with the Trustees on the valuation which showed a funding deficit of 109 million as at 31 March 2013.
Cash contributions to the CWSF for 2014 to 2016 will remain as agreed following the 2010 triennial review.
The first two payments of US$52 million and US$47 million were made in July 2014 and April 2015, respectively.
Payments in 2017, 2018 and 2019 will be based on the outcome of the actuarial funding valuation as at 31 March 2016 and will be in the range of 0 to 23 million US$0 to US$35 million each year necessary to fund the scheme by April 2019.
As at 31 March 2015, the CWSF defined benefit scheme had an IAS 19 Employee Benefits deficit of US$158 million compared with a deficit of US$148 million at 31 March 2014.
Cable & Wireless Communications paid a total contribution of US$52 million in 2014 15 2013 14 US$2 million to the CWSF.
The best estimate of contributions to the CWSF for 2015 16 is US$49 million for employer contributions and US$0 million for employee contributions.
Minimum funding requirement The deficit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees of the CWSF as part of the March 2013 actuarial valuation, which was applicable at 31 March 2015, constitutes a minimal funding requirement.
An adjustment to the deficit in the CWSF to account for the minimum funding requirement has been calculated in accordance with IFRIC 14 The limits on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
The adjustment to the deficit, which is recorded in other comprehensive income, was US$41 million as at 31 March 2015 2013 14 US$22 million.
124 Cable & Wireless Communications Asset-liability matching During 2008, the CWSF Trustees agreed an insurance buy-in of the UK pensioner liabilities with Prudential Insurance.
The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the CWSF under which Prudential Insurance assumed responsibility for the benefits payable to the CWSFs UK pensioners.
In December 2011, a further 233 pensioners, having commenced with pensions in payment since the original annuity, were brought within the bulk annuity policy.
These pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain within the CWSF.
Approximately 63% of the liabilities 2013 14 71% in the CWSF are matched by the annuity policy asset which reduces the funding risk for the Group.
UK unfunded pension arrangements The Group operates unfunded defined benefit arrangements in the UK.
These primarily relate to pension provisions for former Directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap.
The arrangements are governed by individual trust deeds.
One arrangement incorporates a covenant requiring the Group to hold security against the value of the liabilities.
The security is in the form of UK Government gilts which are held separately as available for sale assets note 4.4.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the unfunded arrangements is 16 years.
Overseas schemes The Group operates other defined benefit pension schemes in Jamaica and Barbados.
The schemes are closed to new entrants and the Jamaican scheme is also closed to future accrual.
The schemes are governed by local pension laws and regulations.
The Jamaican scheme owns an insurance policy which matches in full the value of the defined benefit liabilities.
When defined benefit funds have an IAS 19 surplus, they are recorded at the lower of that surplus and the future economic benefits available in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions.
Any adjustment to the surplus net of interest is recorded in other comprehensive income.
The effect of these adjustments, described as asset ceiling adjustments, were US$26 million as at 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 US$22 million and relate to the Groups defined benefit arrangements in Jamaica.
The maximum economic benefit was determined by reference to the reductions in future contributions available to the Group.
The best estimate of contributions to the overseas schemes for 2015 16 is US$2 million for employer contributions and US$nil for employee contributions.
IAS 19 Employee benefits valuation Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and other schemes The IAS 19 valuations of the major defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group have been updated to 31 March 2015 by qualified independent actuaries.
Lane, Clark & Peacock LLP prepared the valuation for the CWSF and the UK unfunded arrangements and reviewed the IAS 19 valuations prepared for Jamaica overseas scheme.
Eckler Ltd prepared the valuation for the Barbados overseas schemes.
The main financial assumptions applied in the valuations and an analysis of schemes assets are as follows: 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 Overseas Overseas CWSF UK unfunded schemes CWSF UK unfunded schemes assumption assumption assumption assumption assumption assumption % % % % % % Significant actuarial assumptions: RPI inflation assumption 2.8 2.8 4.1 3.3 3.3 4.4 Discount rate 3.1 3.1 9.2 4.3 4.3 8.7 Discount rate CWSF uninsured liability 3.2 4.4 Other related actuarial assumptions: CPI inflation assumption 1.8 1.8 2.3 2.3 Salary increases 3.4 5.9 3.8 5.4 Pension increases 1.7-2.7 2.8 2.1-3.2 2.7 Increases to pensions are primarily linked to RPI inflation before and after retirement.

The assumptions shown above for other schemes represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes.
The assumptions regarding current mortality rates in retirement for the CWSF and UK unfunded schemes were set having regard to the actual experience of the CWSFs pensioners and dependants over the six years ended 31 December 2012.
In addition, allowance was made for future mortality improvements in line with the 2012 CMI core projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.
These are the mortality rates used for calculating the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The mortality rates used for the figure in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2015 are updated from those which were used for calculating the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners aged 60 are as follows: On On On 31 March 31 March 31 March 2015 2025 2035 years years years CWSF and UK unfunded: Male pensioners and dependants 28.8 30.0 31.2 Female pensioners 28.2 29.5 30.8 Female dependants 31.3 32.5 33.6 Risks Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group, principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisers: Investment returns: The Groups net balance sheet and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by the schemes: Longevity: The cost to the Group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments.
To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements: and Inflation rate risk: In the UK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the CWSFs population and all of the Jamaican schemes liabilities through the purchase of insurance policies, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees.
Remaining investment risks in the CWSF have also been mitigated to some extent by diversification of the return-seeking assets.
In addition, the defined benefit obligation as measured under IAS 19 is linked to yields on AA rated corporate bonds, however, the majority of the Groups arrangements invest in a number of other assets which will move in a different manner from these bonds.
Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.

The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced for the CWSF scheme as a result of the annuity policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation.
The methods used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
Using the projected unit method for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost is expected to increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Columbus Networks, Columbus provides backhaul connectivity to 42 countries in the region, as well as capacity and IT services, corporate data solutions and data centre services throughout the Caribbean, Central American and the Andean region.
Columbus also provides next generation connectivity and IT solutions, managed networking and cloud-based services under the brand Columbus Business Solutions.
This transaction is in line with the strategy outlined in May 2014 to drive mobile leadership, accelerate fixed-mobile convergence, reinforce TV offer and grow B2B B2G business.
On 31 March 2015, the acquisition was completed for consideration of US$2,121 million comprising a mixture of cash, the Companys shares, capitalised share option amounts and the fair value of put options granted to the Columbus Principal Vendors.
Annual Report 2014 15 129 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section three Operating assets and liabilities 3.11 Acquisitions continued As part of the acquisition of Columbus, Columbus existing US$1,250 million 7.375% Senior Notes due 2021 were assumed by the combined group and two year term loans were obtained: US$390 million secured and US$300 million unsecured term loan agreements which are repayable two years from the date of the close of the acquisition of Columbus.
Additionally, a new revolving credit facility RCF of US$570 million was put in place for a term of five years.
The Columbus Senior Notes, term loans and drawn RCF amounts are reflected in Borrowings note 4.3.
The fair value of the consideration for the acquisition of Columbus is comprised as follows: US$m Cash 708 Shares in CWC 1,287 Fair value of put options 103 Replacement share option awards 23 Total consideration 2,121 The Company issued 1,557,529,605 consideration shares in the capital of the Company to the Principal Vendors.
As a result, the Principal Vendors in aggregate hold 36% of the ordinary shares in the Company.
The share consideration includes a lack of marketability discount.
Each Principal Vendor agreed at completion to enter into lock-up and put option arrangements in respect of its consideration shares.
Under the put option arrangements each Principal Vendor can require the Company to reacquire certain of the consideration shares in four tranches between 2016 and 2019 at a strike price of US$0.7349 per share.
The fair value of this put option of US$103 million has been recognised as an equity instrument within other reserves.
As this put option meets the definition of an equity instrument, it will not be revalued to fair value at subsequent year ends.
The financial liability attaching to the put option was valued using the present value technique at US$879 million refer to note 4.8 which details the accounting for the repurchase option.
As part of the acquisition agreement, Columbus existing Employee Incentive Plan share option plan was cancelled, with certain employees of Columbus rolling over their options into an equivalent CWC share option plan.
As set out in IFRS 3, the fair value of these replacement awards attributable to the pre-acquisition period of service by these employees is taken as part of consideration.
The Group has made a provisional assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date based on estimated total consideration of US$2,121 million.

130 Cable & Wireless Communications The goodwill recognised of US$2,034 million on acquisition was based on the provisional assessment of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition represents the value of the workforce and expected synergies resulting from the integration into the existing business that did not meet the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets as they were unable to be separately identified.
Goodwill is not expected to be tax deductible.
Acquisition-related costs of US$54 million were recorded in these financial statements as other operating expenses.
Exceptional financing costs of US$37 million were recorded in the income statement note 4.1.
These costs relate to requiring backstop facilities for both 2020 US$400 million and Columbus bonds, 2020 US$400 million bondholder consent, Columbus backstop ticking fees and accelerated amortisation of existing RCF capitalised transaction costs.
Additionally, fees of US$57 million were capitalised in the balance sheet, relating to debt issuance costs incurred from the acquisition.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2014, management estimates that the attributable income statement would show pro forma revenue of US$621 million and loss of US$40 million during the period.
The preliminary acquisition accounting includes the payment of US$3 million by Columbus Communications Inc to Brendan Paddick as required under the terms of Brendan Paddicks employment contract with Columbus Communications Inc which was terminated with effect from completion.
