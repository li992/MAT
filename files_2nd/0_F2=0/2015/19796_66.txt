The cost of providing these benefits has been accounted for on a similar basis to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The liability as at 28 February 2015 of 11m 2014: 12m was determined in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
During the year, 1m 2014: 1m has been charged to the Group Income Statement and 1m 2014: 1m of benefits were paid.
Expected contributions The Company would make normal cash contributions of approximately 756m to defined benefit schemes in the financial year ending 27 February 2016, if all schemes remained open to new members and future accrual for the full year.
This may change however depending on the outcome of the consultation on the closure of the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
A plan to pay 270m a year has been agreed with the Trustee to fund the UK pension deficit and to meet the expenses of the scheme.
Due to the timing of the agreement, a portion of this is included in the above value.
