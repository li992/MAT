Of the total deferred tax assets, 6m 2014: 7m are recoverable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other temporary differences.
Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets of 15m 2014: nil have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences whose recoverability is now considered to meet the criteria above as a result of forecast taxable profits in India and an intended reorganisation of operating assets in Brazil.
Deferred tax assets of 105m 2014: 105m have not been recognised in respect of losses and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
The principal items on which no deferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses, including capital losses, of 363m 2014: 370m of which 7m 2014: 13m expire within five years.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted in full, additional tax of 26m 2014: 24m would be payable.
