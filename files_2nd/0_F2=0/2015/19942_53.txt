Financial risk management Group Currency risk Currently, the Group exports 97% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
Currency risk is managed by the Currency Committee, which is chaired by the Group Finance Director and comprises the Chief Executive and senior finance executives.
It meets monthly to review and manage the Groups currency hedging activities, in line with the hedging policy approved by the Board.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging: a minimum of 90% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising from trading in the u forthcoming six month period: and a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising in the following six month period.
u Profitability can vary due to the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the unhedged portion of the transaction exposures and from revised forecasts of future trading, which can lead to an adjustment of currency cover in place.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2015 is 5.8m, 3.7m and 0.7m 2014: 5.5m, 4.2m and 0.7m respectively.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on equity for 2015 is 2.9m, 0.5m and 0.4m 2014: 2.4m, 0.6m and 0.4m respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, theGroup does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether thederivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
The Group alsodocuments its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the incomestatement.
