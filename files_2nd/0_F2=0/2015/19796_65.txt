The measure of volatility used in the Groups option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board considers the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.

The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Groups employees in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Thailand and South Korea.
Of these schemes, the UK represents 95% of the defined benefit deficit 2014: 95%.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 24m 2014: 32m have been recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme the Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by the Trustee.
The Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004, Pensions Act 2014 and all the relevant legislation.
Responsibility for governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustee.
The Trustee is a company whose directors comprise of: a representatives of the Group: and b the Scheme participants, in accordance with its articles of association and UK pension law.
All members are eligible to join the Career Average section of the Scheme Pension Builder, where benefits are based on a members salary and their length of service.
There is a Final Salary section of the Scheme which was closed to new entrants in 2001.
Following the year end, the Group has entered consultation on the closure of the UK defined benefit pension scheme to new entrants and future accrual.
This has had no impact on the results for the year ended 28 February 2015.
128 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Note 26 Post-employment benefits continued Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2014, using the projected unit method.
At 31 March 2014, the actuarial deficit was 2,751m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 8,020m and these assets represented 75% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The scheme has a duration of 24 years.
Scheme Liabilities as at 31 March 2014 The table below shows a breakdown of the liabilities held by the Scheme as at 31 March 2014, the date of the last triennial valuation: % Active 55 Deferred 21 Pensioner 24 The table below shows a breakdown of the liabilities for active members held by the Scheme as at 31 March 2014: % Pension Builder 57 Final Salary 43 Overseas The most significant overseas schemes are the funded defined benefit schemes which operate in the Republic of Ireland, Thailand and South Korea.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the Republic of Ireland scheme as at 1 April 2013, Thailand as at 28 February 2013 and South Korea as at 28 February 2015.
The accounting valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of the applicable accounting standard in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 28 February 2015.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 28 February 2015.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.
Principal assumptions The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as follows: 2015 2014 % % Discount rate 3.7 4.7 Price inflation 3.1 3.3 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.1 2.3 Rate of increase in salaries 3.2 3.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment Benefits accrued before 1 June 2012 2.9 3.1 Benefits accrued after 1 June 2012 2.1 2.3 Rate of increase in career average benefits Benefits accrued before 1 June 2012 3.1 3.3 Benefits accrued after 1 June 2012 2.1 2.3 In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP element.
UK mortality assumptions The Group conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014 the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: Base tables: 95% of the SAPS S2 normal male pensioners for male staff and 80% of the SAPS S2 normal light male pensioners for male senior managers.
SAPS S2 all female pensioners with multipliers of 100% for female staff and 80% for female senior managers.
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 28 February 2015 for the main UK scheme.
The mortality assumptions used are based on tables that have been projected to 2014 with CMI 2013 improvements.
In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements from 2014 is in line with CMI 2013 with a long term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the reporting date and a member reaching age 65 at reporting date 25 years.
2015 2014 Years Years Retiring at reporting date at age 65: Male 23.0 22.9 Female 24.4 24.4 Retiring at reporting date 25 years at age 65: Male 25.3 25.2 Female 26.7 26.6 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 129 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 26 Post-employment benefits continued Risks The Group bears a numbers of risks in relation to the Scheme, which are described below: Investment risk The Schemes accounting liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the return on the Schemes assets underperform this rate, the accounting deficit will increase.
The Trustee and the Group regularly monitor the funding position and operate a diversified investment strategy.
Inflation risk The Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation therefore higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
This will be partially offset by an increase in any Scheme assets that are linked to, or correlate with, inflation.
Changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to reduce the Schemes exposure to inflation risk by changing the basis for calculating the rate of increase in pensions to CPI previously RPI.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Schemes liabilities.
However, this may be partially offset by an increase in the capital value of the Schemes assets that have similar characteristics.
Life expectancy risk The Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and so increases in life expectancy will lead to higher liabilities.
To reduce this risk, changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to increase the age at which members can take their full pension by two years.
Furthermore the Group has the ability to change this in the future if there are further unexpected changes in life expectancy.
An Audit & Risk Pensions Committee was established to further strengthen our Trustee Governance and provide greater oversight and stronger internal control over our risks.
Further mitigation of the risks is provided by external advisors and the Trustee who consider the funding position, fund performance, and impacts of any regulatory changes.
A different approach is used to calculate the triennial actuarial liabilities and the accounting liabilities.
The key difference is that the accounting valuation requires the discount rate to be set using corporate bonds whilst the actuarial liabilities discount rate is based on expected returns of Scheme assets.
Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions 2015 2014 m m Change in UK defined benefit obligation from a 0.1% increase in discount rate 340 240 Increase in UK defined benefit obligation from a 1% increase in pensions in payment 1,920 1,210 Increase in UK defined benefit obligation from a 1% increase in salary growth 310 320 Increase in UK defined benefit obligation from each additional year of longevity assumed 490 350 The method and assumptions used to determine sensitivity and their limitation is the effect of varying the assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
