Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES continued For the 52 weeks ended 3 October 2015 25 RETIREMENT BENEFITS During the period the Group contributed to a funded dened benefit pension plan and a number of dened contribution pensionplans.
Dened contribution plans Pension costs for dened contribution plans are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Dened contribution plans 6.3 4.3 Dened benefit plan The Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme is a final salary pension plan which provides benets to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The plan closed to future accrual on 30 September 2014 and the link to future salary increases was also removed.
The plan operates under the UK regulatory framework and is governed by a board of Trustees composed of plan participants and representatives of the Group.
The Trustees make investment decisions and set the required contribution rates based on independent actuarial advice.
The key risks to which the plan exposes the Group are as follows: Volatility of plan assets Changes in bond yields Ination risk Changes in life expectancy The movements in the fair value of plan assets and the present value of the dened benefit obligation during the period were: Present value Fair value of dened Net surplus of plan assets benefit obligation deficit 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m m m At beginning of the period 453.6 427.8 445.8 432.9 7.8 5.1 Current service cost 2.1 2.1 Interest income expense 18.0 18.6 17.4 18.5 0.6 0.1 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets excluding interest income 19.6 14.0 19.6 14.0 Effect of changes in demographic assumptions 5.5 0.4 5.5 0.4 Effect of changes in financial assumptions 20.4 26.2 20.4 26.2 Effect of experience adjustments 11.4 11.4 Past service cost 12.9 12.9 Cash ows: Employer contributions 14.0 15.2 14.0 15.2 Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 Administrative expenses paid from plan assets 0.7 0.6 0.7 0.6 Benets paid 21.8 21.5 21.8 21.5 At end of the period 482.7 453.6 467.7 445.8 15.0 7.8 Pension costs recognised in the income statement A credit of nil 2014: 10.8 million comprising the current service cost and the past service cost is included within employee costs note 5 and a charge of 0.1 million 2014: 0.5 million comprising the net interest on the net dened benefit asset liability and the administrative expenses paid from plan assets is included within net finance costs note 6.
A negative past service cost of 11.2 million was recognised in the prior period due to the closure of the plan to future accrual at 30 September 2014 and the cutting of the link to future salary increases with effect from this date.
The net credit of 10.8 million comprising this negative past service cost less the associated costs of 0.4 million was classed as a non-underlying item note 4.
104 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 25 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED An updated actuarial valuation of the plan was performed by Mercer as at 3 October 2015 for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benets.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.7% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries N A 3.6% Rate of increase in pensions 5% LPI 2.9% 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% LPI 2.1% 2.1% Ination assumption RPI 3.0% 3.1% Ination assumption CPI 2.0% 2.1% Employed deferred revaluation 2.0% 2.1% Life expectancy for deferred members from age 65 years Male 23.3 23.6 Female 25.8 26.0 Life expectancy for current pensioners from age 65 years Male 21.6 21.8 Female 23.9 24.1 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for plan experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
The sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to changes in the principal actuarial assumptions is: Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 3.9% Increase by 4.2% Ination assumption 0.25% Increase by 2.4% Decrease by 1.9% Life expectancy One year Increase by 3.2% Decrease by 3.2% The above sensitivity analyses have been determined by changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
This is unlikely to be the case in practice as changes in some of the assumptions could be correlated.
When calculating the above sensitivities the same method has been applied as when calculating the net dened benefit asset liability in the balance sheet i. e. the present value of the dened benefit obligation calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2015 2014 m m Equities Properties 139.8 197.2 Bonds Gilts 272.9 203.6 Cash Other 21.2 4.8 Buy-in policy matching annuities 48.8 48.0 482.7 453.6 The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 37.6 million 2014: 32.6 million.
A proportion of the dened benefit obligation has been secured by a buy-in policy and as such this proportion of liabilities is matched by annuities.
The Trustees of the plan hold a range of assets and are aiming to better align the cash ows from these to those of the plan.
They are also working with the Group to fide-risk their portfolio further.
To this end changes to the allocation of assets have occurred during the current period.
