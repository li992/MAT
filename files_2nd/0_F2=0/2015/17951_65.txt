At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries which would be subject to dividend withholding tax was 2 billion 2014: 2 billion.

While there is uncertainty over the timeframe of the appeal process, it is estimated that had discounting been applied the carrying value of the asset would have been reduced by approximately 4 million.
Amounts receivable from related parties including associated undertakings are shown in note 29.
