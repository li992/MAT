berkeley AnnuAl report 2015 finAnciAls Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies General information The Berkeley Group Holdings plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered office is Berkeley House, 19 Portsmouth Road, Cobham, Surrey, KT11 1JG.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group are engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development.
Further information about the nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors Report on page 83.
Basis of preparation These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with European Union endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRS-IC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on the going concern basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed on page 101.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2014: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities: IAS 27 amendment, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: IAS 28 Amendment, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: IAS 32 amendment, Financial Instruments: IAS 36 amendment, Impairment of Assets and IAS 39 amendment, Financial Instruments.
These standards have not had a material impact on the results of the Company for the year ended 30 April 2015.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not yet effective for the financial year ending 30 April 2015 and have not been adopted early: IAS 19 Amendments Employee contributions, Annual Improvements 2010-2012 Cycle, Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle, Annual Improvements 2012-2014, IFRS10 and IAS 28 Amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture, IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
These standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group has significant financial resources and the Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and compared this to the level of committed loan facilities and cash resources over the medium term.
In making this assessment, consideration has been given to the uncertainty inherent in future financial forecasts and where applicable, reasonable sensitivities have been applied to the key factors affecting the financial performance of the Group.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
b Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are identified in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The Group determines its reportable segments having regard to permitted aggregation criteria with the principal condition being that the operating segments should have similar economic characteristics.
The Group is predominantly engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development, comprising residential revenue, revenue from land sales and commercial revenue.
For the purposes of determining its operating segments, the chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Committee of the Board.
This committee approves investment decisions, allocates the Groups resources and reviews the internal reporting in order to assess performance.
98 05 BERKAR15 Notes 98-120. indd 98 14 07 2015 10:24 Strategic report governance FinancialS berkeley AnnuAl report 2015 finAnciAls The Group has determined that its operating segments are the management teams that report into the Executive Committee of the Board.
These management teams are all engaged in residential-led, mixed-use development in the United Kingdom and, having regard to the aggregation criteria in IFRS 8, the Group has one reportable operating segment.
In addition to its development activities, the Group holds certain residential properties for investment purposes.
These investment activities represent a separate segment which is included within Other activities, as they do not meet the size thresholds to be disclosed as a separate reportable segment.
Revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties, investment properties and ground rent assets during the year and other income directly associated with property development.
Properties are treated as sold and profits are recognised when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
Ground rent assets are treated as sold when all material conditions precedent to the sale have been satisfied and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the purchaser.
See Accounting estimates and judgements below for further disclosures on revenue recognition.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Any lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Expenditure Expenditure recorded in inventory is expensed through cost of sales at the time of the related property sale.
The amount of cost related to each property includes its share of the overall site costs including, where relevant, its share of forecast costs to complete.
Net operating expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
See Accounting estimates and judgements below for further disclosures on cost recognition.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxation assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Intangible assets Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews and impairment reviews performed where an impairment indicator exists, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% Fixtures and fittings 15% 20% Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 1 3 % Freehold property disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements consists of both freehold land and freehold buildings.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Computer equipment is included within fixtures and fittings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is identified and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within net operating expenses in the income statement.
99 05 BERKAR15 Notes 98-120. indd 99 14 07 2015 10:24 berkeley AnnuAl report 2015 finAnciAls Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Investment properties Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rental income, are recognised using the cost model and are carried in the statement of financial position at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the element of the cost of the assets that relates to buildings at 2% per annum on a straight line basis.
No depreciation is charged on the element of the cost of the assets that relates to land.
Sales of investment properties are recognised in revenue and cost sales.
These are considered to be similar in nature to the underlying property sales of the Group.
Inventories Property in the course of development and completed units are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at cost.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the cost differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within net operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against net operating expense in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances in hand and at the bank, including bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form part of the Groups cash management, for which offset arrangements across Group businesses have been applied where appropriate.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, sold or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value which is considered to be their fair value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated.
See Accounting estimates and judgements below for further disclosures on recognition of provisions.
Deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables.
Employee benefits a Pensions The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plan was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
For the defined benefit scheme, the obligations are measured using the projected unit method.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a qualified actuary.
The operating and financing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are set annually on the basis of actuarial valuations of the scheme and financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
In accordance with IAS 19 the Group does not recognise on the statement of financial position any surplus in the scheme.
Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
b Share-based payments Equity-settled Where the Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, taking into account only service and non-market conditions.
100 05 BERKAR15 Notes 98-120. indd 100 14 07 2015 10:24 Strategic report governance FinancialS berkeley AnnuAl report 2015 finAnciAls At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Cash-settled The cost of cash settled transactions is recognised as an expense over the vesting period measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognised on the balance sheet.
The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
During the year, the Company changed its policy for the accounting of equity-settled share-based payment schemes in the event that such schemes are modified, in full or in part, to become cash settled.
The effect of this change in policy has been to recognise a charge in the income statement of 47.0 million, which previously would have been debited directly to reserves.
This related to the modification of the basis of settlement for a proportion of the awards under Part B of the 2009 LTIP which was undertaken in the year.
The effect on basic earnings per share in the year was a reduction of 34.7 pence.
There is no impact of this change in accounting policy on the prior years presented in the financial statements, nor in those years presented in the five year record.
See Accounting estimates and judgements below for further disclosures on recognition of share based payments.
Dividends Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payout and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Leasing agreements Payments and receipts under operating lease agreements are charged or credited against profit on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management applies the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgements, of which no individual judgement is deemed to have a significant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to assess the risks and forecast the costs in future years to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b Provisions The Group makes assumptions to determine the timing and its best estimate of the quantum of its construction and other liabilities for which provisions are held.
c Revenue recognition Assumptions are made which complement external certifications to assess whether the building work for properties sold is physically complete and legal completion is highly probable and hence whether the Groups revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
d Share-based payments Assumptions are made in determining the fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of options under share-based payment awards at the date of grant.
2 Segmental disclosure For the purposes of determining its operating segments, the chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Committee of the Board.
The Group has determined that its operating segments are the management teams that report into the Executive Committee of the Board.
These investment activities represent a separate segment which is included within other activities as it does not meet the size thresholds to be disclosed as separate reportable segments.
Revenue and operating profit for the year ended 30 April 2015 included 8.3 million and 1.3 million, respectively, on the sale of 53 other investment properties.
Revenue and operating profit for the year ended 30 April 2014 included 105.4 million and 29.6 million, respectively, on the sale of 534 properties to M&G Investments and 32.8 million and 13.6 million, respectively, on the sale of 141 other investment properties.

3 Disposal of ground rent assets During the year end 30 April 2015, the Group sold a portfolio of ground rent assets for consideration of 99.8 million and a gross profit of 85.1 million.
Income and expenses associated with this sale have been recognised in the income statement through revenue and gross profit in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for revenue and expenditure.
The Group has exchanged contracts for the sale of a further portfolio of ground rent assets for 53 million.
The sale is expected to give rise to a profit on disposal of approximately 50 million after transaction costs in the year ending 30 April 2016.
The sale will be recognised in the income statement through revenue and profit in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for revenue and expenditure.

Amortisation of facility fees includes fees expensed in relation to a refinancing of the Groups revolving credit facilities in 2012 which was superseded by the recent refinancing of the facilities in 2015.
See note 26 for further information.
Other finance costs represent imputed interest on taxation and on land purchased on deferred settlement terms.

The appointment of auditors to the Groups pension scheme and the fees paid in respect of the audit are agreed by the trustees of the scheme, who act independently of the management of the Group.
The fees paid to the Groups auditors for audit services to the pension scheme during the year were 10,000 2014: nil.
Fees paid in the year to the Groups current auditor for audit-related assurance services relate to the interim review.
In the prior year, fees paid to the Groups current auditor for other services disclosed in the table above relate only to the period from the date of appointment of 6 December 2013.
Fees paid in respect of the full year ended 30 April 2014 were 0.1 million for taxation advisory services and 0.1 million for all other non-audit services.

MrSimpkin has issued legal proceedings against the Company arising from his employment and its termination.
These proceedings were received by the Company on 12 December 2014 and 25 June 2015.
The Company is defending the proceedings with the assistance of external legal advisers.

The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments in the year relating to grants of share options awarded under the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan was 55.5m 2014: 9.0m.
The charge of 55.5m in 2015 includes 47.0m, of which 33.5m relates to the modification of the basis of settlement and 13.5m relates to the fair value charge for the current year, in respect of the Companys decision to offer to pay the income tax and national insurance liabilities of participants under Part B of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan in lieu of issuing shares of an equivalent value to them.
This effectively determined the part of the scheme to be accounted for on a cash-settlement basis, which is explained further below.
The decision and the resultant income statement charge relates to options vesting at both 15 April 2015 and 15 April 2016.
The charge to the income statement attributable to key management is 33.0m 2014: 2.3m.
There were no exercisable share options at the end of the year.
2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan Part B Part B of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan covers 6,830,000 2014: 6,830,000 share options with an exercise price of 4.96.
Vesting of the options is in two tranches: 50% on 15 April 2015 and 50% on 15 April 2016.
The options are conditional on continued employment at the relevant vesting date and the satisfaction of the underpin condition that Net Assets per Share are at least 9.00 at 15 April 2015 and 15 April 2016.
During the year, 280,000 options lapsed on the departure of employees 2014: 30,000 prior to the shares vesting on 15 April 2015, leaving 5,810,000 options to vest.
In accordance with the scheme, 50% of these options became exercisable by the relevant employees on 15 April 2015.
As a result, 2,384,943 shares were issuable to the participants, representing 2,905,000 options that vested under 2009 LTIP Part B, less 520,057 of shares equivalent to the exercise price on vesting of 4.96 per share, where the exercise price was not settled in cash by the participants.
The Company elected to enable participants to choose to allow the Company to settle the income tax and national insurance liabilities of the participants of the Scheme in lieu of issuing shares to them for an equivalent value.
This reduced the number of shares issuable by a further 1,078,300 to 1,306,643 which were issued on 15 April 2015.
The share price at the date of vesting was 27.11.
As at 30 April 2015 there were 2,905,000 options outstanding 2014: 6,090,000, and there was 23.7 million carrying amount of liabilities in respect of these options.
2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company announced in June 2011 as part of a strategic review of the business a long term plan to return approximately 1.7 billion to shareholders over the next 10 years.
The rules were subsequently amended and approved at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to allow the returns to be made through a combination of dividends 13 per share and share buy backs distributions.
The cumulative distributions required by the plan on or before the relative milestone dates are set out below: Cumulative distributions 30 September 2015 4.34 per share 30 September 2018 4.33 per share 30 September 2021 4.33 per share A long term remuneration plan was proposed to support this strategy, the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 September 2011 and the amendment at the Annual General Meeting on 5 September 2012.
The key features of the 2011 LTIP are: if the Company returns 1.7 billion to shareholders over a ten year period via a series of dividend payments 13 per share and share buy backs by the milestone dates referred to above, participants will be entitled to exercise options and receive a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at the end of the ten year period.
the maximum number of shares capable of being earned by all participants are 19,616,503 shares, being 13% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company at the date of approval of the plan.
the exercise price of options granted under the 2011 LTIP will be 13 per share less an amount equal to the value of all dividends paid between the date of approval of the 2011 LTIP and 30 September 2021, provided the exercise price cannot be less than zero.
The fair value of the options granted during that year, determined using the current market pricing model, was 3.17 for options which vest on 30 September 2021.
The inputs into the current market option pricing model were: Inputs Grant date 5 September 2011 Vesting date 30 September 2021 Share price at grant date p 1,236 Exercise price p nil Discount rate 6.3% The discount rate was determined by calculating the Groups expected cost of capital over the vesting period at the grant date.
Cash-settled share-based payments Bonus Plan.
Under the Bonus Plan, in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 76, the balance on the plan account at the end of the financial year was the final balance and has been settled 50% in cash and 50% in shares.
The liability has been accrued over the vesting period.
The income statement is charged with an estimate for the vesting of notional shares awarded subject to service and non-market performance conditions.

The notional shares have a contractual life of five years after the bonus is allocated, and are settled in cash subject to continued employment by the Company and individual and divisional performance criteria.
The liability is accrued over the vesting period.
The total carrying amount of liabilities for share appreciation rights at the end of the year was 26.7m 2014: 13.0m.
Pensions During the year, two principal pension schemes were in place for employees.
The Berkeley Group plc Group Personal Pension Plan and the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan are defined contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a defined benefit scheme which was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
Defined contribution plan Contributions amounting to 4.5m 2014: 3.3m were paid into the defined contribution schemes during the year.
Defined benefit plan As at 30 April 2015, the Group operated one defined benefit pension scheme which was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
This is a separate trustee administered fund holding the pension plan assets to meet long term pension liabilities for some 335 past employees.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the last three years of employment prior to leaving active service and is linked to changes in inflation up to retirement.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recently finalised valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2013 and finalised in December 2013.
The method adopted in the 2013 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment both prior to and after retirement of 4.00% per annum and pension increases of 3.25% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets as at 1 May 2013 was 16.2m and covered 97% of the schemes liabilities.
Following the finalisation of the 2007 valuation, with effect from 1 July 2008, employers required regular contributions were reduced to zero.
Following the finalisation of the 2013 valuation, the Group agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme to make additional contributions to the Scheme of 0.2m for the remainder of the year 1 December 2013 to 30 April 2014 to address the Schemes deficit after which required contributions were reduced to zero.
Notwithstanding this the Group made additional voluntary contributions of 0.5m during the year 2014: 0.6m.
For the purposes of IAS 19, the 2013 valuation was updated for 30 April 2015.
The most significant risks to which the plan exposes the group are: Inflation risk: A rise in inflation rates will lead to higher plan liabilities as a large proportion of the defined benefit obligation is indexed in line with price inflation.
This effect will be limited due to caps on inflationary increases to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
Interest rate risk: A decrease in corporate bond yields would result in an increase to plan liabilities although this effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Mortality risk: An increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to plan liabilities as a significant proportion of the Pension Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member.

Sensitivity Analysis The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would have increased as a result of a change in the respective assumptions.
Change in Change in defined benefit Assumption obligation Discount rate -0.25% p. a 4.2% Rate of inflation 0.25% p. a 2.9% Rate of mortality 1 year 3.0% These calculations provide an approximate guide to the sensitivity of results and may not be as accurate as a full valuation carried out on these assumptions.
In practice, changes in some of the assumptions are correlated and so each assumption change is unlikely to occur in isolation, as shown above.
Funding The Group expects to pay 0.6m in contributions to its defined benefit plan in the year ending 30 April 2016 i. e. the next annual reporting period, albeit it has no obligation to do so.

8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated as profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders of the Group divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
2015 2014 Profit attributable to shareholders m 423.5 292.9 Weighted average number of shares m 135.3 132.1 Basic earnings per ordinary share p 313.0 221.8 For diluted earnings per ordinary share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
At 30 April 2015, the Group had three 2014: three categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: 2.9 million 4.96 share options under the 2009 LTIP Part B, 16.1 million 2014: 19.6 million nil share options under the 2011 LTIP and 0.5 million 2014: nil share options under the Bonus Banking plan.
2.9 million share options vested on 15 April 2015 under the 2009 LTIP Part B scheme and 1.3 million were issued to participants, with the Company settling the option price and participants tax liability in respect of the balance, in lieu of issuing shares.
In 2014, 4.4 million share options vested and were issued on 31 January 2014 under the Part A of the 2009 LTIP scheme.
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the aggregate of the exercise price of each share option and the fair value of future services to be supplied to the Group which is the unamortised share-based payments charge.
The difference between the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value and the total number of options is used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.

The goodwill balance on St James Group Limited Cash Generating Unit is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the value in use of the business using the current five year pre-tax forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash flows beyond a five year period are not extrapolated: ii A pre-tax discount rate of 12.06% 2014: 13.21% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have identified no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.

Other reserve The other reserve of negative 961.3m 2014: negative 961.3m arose from the application of merger accounting principles to the financial statements on implementation of the capital reorganisation of the Group, incorporating a Scheme of Arrangement, in the year ended 30 April 2005.
Revaluation reserve The revaluation reserve consists of balances in relation to two separate transactions.
The first element arose following the acquisition on 7 November 2006 of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited not already owned.
A revaluation reserve of 20.3m was originally created in accordance with IFRS 3 through fair value adjustments to the 50% of the net assets of St James Group Limited owned by the Group prior to 7 November 2006.
Transfers of 3.9m in the year 2014: nil out of retained earnings was recognised as the associated fair value adjustments.
At 30 April 2015 the balance in the revaluation reserve relating to the acquisition of St James Group Limited is nil 2014: 3.9m.
The second element arose in 2010 following the acquisition on 23 July 2009 of the shares owned by Saad Investments Company Limited and the outstanding shareholder loans in five joint ventures which became fully owned subsidiaries from this date.
A revaluation reserve of 0.6m was created in accordance with IFRS 3 through fair value adjustments to the 50% of the net assets of the joint ventures owned by the Group prior to 23 July 2009.

The Group has performance agreements in the ordinary course of business of 19.5m which are guaranteed by third parties 2014: 15.0m.
The Group considers that the likelihood of an outflow of cash under these agreements is low and that no provision is required.

The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain an appropriate capital structure in the business to allow management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in the short and medium term.
This allows the Group to take advantage of prevailing market conditions by investing in land and work in progress at the right point in the cycle or delivering returns to shareholders through dividends or share buy backs.
In 2012 the Group put in place a long-term strategic plan to see 13 per share returned to shareholders over the following 10 years.
This plan, reported in more detail in the Trading and Financial Review on pages 50 to 54, ensures there is sufficient working capital retained in the business to continue investing selectively in new land opportunities as they arise.
The Group monitors capital levels principally by monitoring net cash debt levels, cash flow forecasts and return on average capital employed.
The Group considers capital employed to be net assets adjusted for net cash debt.
The decrease in capital employed in the year of 105.1m reflects an increase in net cash holdings during the year.
The Groups financial instruments comprise financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities being: bank loans, trade payables, deposits and on account receipts, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are the principal financial instruments used to finance the business.
The other financial instruments highlighted arise in the ordinary course of business.
As all of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling there is no direct currency risk, and therefore the Groups main financial risks are primarily: liquidity risk the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available: market interest rate risk the risk that Group financing activities are adversely affected by fluctuation in market interest rates: and credit risk the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group.

Cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits held at either floating rates linked to LIBOR or fixed rates.
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.

Current bank loans have term expiry dates within twelve months of the balance sheet date and are held at floating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Trade payables and other current liabilities are non-interest bearing.

Current trade receivables and current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms and have a short period to maturity less than one year.
Current trade receivables include 14.4m relating to amounts owed by St Edward Homes Limited in respect of the inventory sold by the Group in 2009 Note 27.
This is held at its discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The discount rate applied reflects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity profile.
Non-current trade payables comprise long-term land payables, which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The discount rate applied reflects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity profile of the individual land creditors within the total.
Non-current loans approximate to fair value as they are held at variable market interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Group management addresses this risk through review of rolling cash flow forecasts throughout the year to assess and monitor the current and forecast availability of funding, and to ensure sufficient headroom against facility limits and compliance with banking covenants.
The committed borrowing facilities are set out below.
The contractual undiscounted maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, included at their carrying value in the preceding tables, is as follows: 2015 2014 m m In less than one year 543.5 441.5 In more than one year but not more than two years 68.0 55.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 33.0 96.0 In more than five years 35.0 1.0 679.5 593.5 Market interest rate risk The Groups cash and cash equivalents and bank loans expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups rolling cash flow forecasts incorporate appropriate interest assumptions, and management carefully assesses expected activity levels and associated funding requirements in the prevailing and forecast interest rate environment to ensure that this risk is managed.
If interest rates on the Groups cash debt balances had been 50 basis points higher throughout the year ended 30 April 2015, profit after tax for the year would have been 1,014,000 higher 2014: 483,000 higher.
This calculation is based on the monthly closing net cash debt balance throughout the year.
A 50 basis point increase in interest rate represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change for the year ended 30 April 2015. Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk encompasses the financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade receivables are spread across a wide number of customers, with no significant concentration of credit risk in one area.
There has been no impairment of trade receivables during the year 2014: nil, nor are there any provisions held against trade receivables 2014: nil, and no trade receivables are past their due date 2014: nil.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because counterparties are leading international banks with long-term A credit-ratings assigned by international credit agencies.

The term of the facility is 5 years with a maturity date of 23 March 2020.
At 30 April 2015 the total drawn down balance of the facility was nil 2014: nil.
In addition, at 30 April 2015 there were bank bonds in issue of 5.0m 2014: 0.2m.
The revolving credit facility is secured by debentures provided by certain Group holding companies over their assets.
The facility agreement contains financial covenants, which is normal for such agreements, with all of which the Group is in compliance.
27 Related party transactions The Group has entered into the following related party transactions: Transactions with directors In terms of new transactions in the 2015 financial year: i During the financial year, Mr A W Pidgley paid 25,470 2014: 440,052 to Berkeley Homes plc for works carried out at his home under the Groups own build scheme.
This is a scheme whereby eligible employees may enter into an arrangement, at commercial rates, with the Group for the construction or renovation of their own home.
There were no balances outstanding at the year end.
ii Berkeley Homes plc has entered into an agreement with Langham Homes, a company controlled by Mr T K Pidgley who is the son of the Groups Chairman, under which Langham Homes will be paid a fee for a land introduction on an arms length basis.
A fee of 173,000 was paid under this agreement in the period and there were no outstanding balances at 30 April 2015 when the land purchase became unconditional.
Langham Homes continues to introduce land to the Group and in the event that any further land purchases are agreed, further fees may be payable to Langham Homes in future periods.
In prior years, 1,274,000 has been paid to Langham Homes in respect of two sites acquired by the Group, also on an arms length basis.
iii Mr G J Fry, a Director of the Company, contracted to purchase an apartment at Brewery Wharf, London and a car parking space for 565,000 on 21 August 2014 from St James Group Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Ms D Brightmore-Armour, on 14 April 2014 prior to becoming a Director of the Company, contracted to purchase an apartment at 190 Strand, London for 2,985,000 from St Edward Homes Limited, a joint venture of the Company, for which shareholder approval was not required.
Subsequent to this purchase, and having been appointed a Director of the Company, Ms Brightmore-Armour received Board approval to purchase a storage room at the property for 101,200.
The agreements between St James Group Limited and Mr Fry and St Edward Homes Limited and Ms Brightmore-Armour are standard form sale and purchase agreements used by the Company on its developments, save that Mr Frys purchase of his apartment and Ms Brightmore-Armours purchase of the storage room are conditional upon the agreement of shareholders.
As these transactions are in excess of 100,000, they constitute a substantial property transaction with a Director of the Company under sections 190 and 191 of the Companies Act 2006 and are therefore conditional on the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting in September 2015.
Mr Fry paid a ten per cent deposit on exchange of contracts which will only be returned to him in the event that shareholders do not approve the transaction.
Ms Brightmore-Armour has already paid a 10% deposit on exchange of contracts for the apartment and no further deposit is payable on purchase of the storage room, with payment due on completion.
In terms of transactions previously disclosed, all of which received shareholder approval, the purchases of an apartment by Mr G Fry at at Sovereign Court for 819,950 in 2014 and by Mr R C Perrins at 190 Strand for 2,100,000 in 2013.
At 30 April 2015, any contractual deposit due to date had been paid to the Group, there were no current balances outstanding and the properties were still under construction and so the sales had not yet completed.
The purchase of an apartment by Mr A W Pidgley at Ebury Square in 2013 for 10,500,000 completed and the balance of monies were fully settled in the year, along with a further 1,330,000 for enhancements to specification.
The purchase of an apartment by Mr G Fry at Chelsea Creek in 2012 for 725,000 completed and the balance was fully settled in the year.
Transactions with joint ventures During the financial year there were no transactions with joint ventures other than movements in loans.
In 2009 inventory was sold to St Edward Homes Limited for 17,411,000 being the share of the transaction attributable to the other venturer in the joint venture.
At 30 April 2015 an amount of 14,449,000 was outstanding and included within trade receivables 2014: 16,219,000.
