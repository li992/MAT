The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures 16.1 Market risk Henderson assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment policy by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from Henderson.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors Hendersons compliance with the Companys objectives and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Companys exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Equities 726,808 685,414 Fixed interest 23 42 726,831 685,456 Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the Companys net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2014: 20% in the fair values of the Companys investments at each statement of financial position date.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk Henderson monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
Henderson measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rates to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Companys exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 20% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
During the year, derivative contracts were not used to hedge against exposure to currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
Hong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2015 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 228 101 999 45 Cash and cash equivalents 3,352 Current liabilities 527 32 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 228 101 472 3,365 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 203,694 65,020 81,615 18,737 84,254 Total net foreign currency exposures 203,922 65,121 82,087 18,737 87,619 Hong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ Other 2014 000 000 000 000 000 Other receivables 242 13 721 70 357 Cash and cash equivalents 1 990 Current liabilities 860 2,788 Total foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 617 13 2,067 70 1,347 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 185,375 48,324 57,833 33,046 84,264 Total net foreign currency exposures 184,758 48,337 55,766 33,116 85,611 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to risk during each year, as levels of monetary foreign currency exposure change significantly throughout the year.
57 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
2 Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US dollar sterling, euro sterling, Japanese yen sterling and Hong Kong dollar sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar sterling - 10% 2014: 10%, euro sterling - 10% 2014: 10%, Japanese yen sterling - 10% 2014: 10%, Hong Kong dollar sterling - 10% 2014: 10%.
These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each statement of financial position date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2015 2014 Hong Hong US Japanese Kong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 153 137 105 65 455 121 105 101 Capital return 22,561 7,201 9,039 2,075 20,564 5,361 6,416 3,666 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 22,714 7,338 9,144 2,140 21,019 5,482 6,521 3,767 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of an appreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2015 2014 Hong Hong US Japanese Kong US Japanese Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 125 112 86 61 210 99 86 83 Capital return 18,459 5,892 7,396 1,698 16,825 4,385 5,249 2,999 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 18,584 6,004 7,482 1,759 17,035 4,484 5,335 3,082 16.1.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of the fixed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
58 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.1.
3 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure T he exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
Floating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2015 2014 More More Within than one Within than one one year year Total one year year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 31,762 31,762 5,023 5,023 Current asset investment 28,323 28,323 3,896 3,896 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Fixed interest investments 23 23 42 42 Bank Loans 2,788 2,788 Debentures 10,000 15,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 Loan note 49,795 49,795 50,085 64,772 14,687 6,131 24,958 18,827 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made and borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2014:same.
Interest paid on debentures is set out in note 7.
Interest rate sensitivity The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investments, fixed income investment portfolio and bank loans.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 31,762,000 2014: 5,023,000 and, if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 317,620 2014: 50,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Companys interest bearing current asset investment at the year end was 28,323,000 2014: 3,896,000 and, if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, a 100 basis points change in interest rates upor down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 283,000 2014:39,000.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys fixed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 23,000 2014: 42,000 and is not currently paying interest and therefore there is no modified duration interest rate sensitivity 2014: no duration.
Bank loan sensitivity Borrowings vary throughout the year as a result of the Companys borrowing policy.
Bank loan borrowings at the year end were nil 2014: 2,788,000 note 14 and, if that level of borrowings was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis point change in LIBOR up or down would decrease or increase the total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately nil 2014: 28,000.
16.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has an overdraft facility with the custodian, the extent of which is determined by the custodian on a regular basis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facility is subject to regular review.
TheCompany also has two debentures and a loan note, details of which can be found in notes 14 and 15 on page 55.
The Board gives guidance to Henderson as to the maximum amounts of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
59 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Risk management policies and procedures continued 16.2 Liquidity risk continued The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that short-term borrowings be used to manage short-term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required was as follows: 2015 2014 Due between Due between Due within three months Due after Due within three months Due after three months and one year one year three months and one year one year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 12,250 21,150 2,250 35,650 Loan note 920 920 84,960 Bank loans 2,788 Other payables 1,848 2,076 2,768 13,170 106,110 4,864 2,250 35,650 16.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: and cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the statement of financial position.
Details of the securities on loan at the year end and the collateral held can be found in note 4 on page 51.
Other than stock lending transactions, none of the Companys financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Company through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default through settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed periodically by Henderson, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
The Company is exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Companys cash balances are held by its custodian, BNP Paribas Securities Services.
The Directors believe the counterparty is of high credit quality and, therefore, the Company has minimal exposure to credit risk.

The par value of the debenture stocks and unsecured loan notes can be found in notes 14 and 15.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade.
The fair value of the unsecured loan note at 31 October 2015 was 49,795,000 2014: nil.
The fair value of the loan note is estimated to be its par value as there has been no significant change in the conditions of the Company or market since issue.
16.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out the fair value measurements using the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The total carrying value of loans and receivables, as stated in notes 13 and 14, is a reasonable approximation of their fair value as at the year end date.
The total carrying value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost as disclosed in notes 14 and 15 is a reasonable approximation of their fair value at the year end date.
