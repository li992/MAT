6 Segmental reporting Segmental analysis of operating profit and profit before tax The Groups insurance segment writes insurance products for the retirement market which include Guaranteed Income for Life Solutions and Defined Benefit fide-risking Solutions, Care Plans, and Capped Drawdown contracts and invests the premiums received from these contracts in corporate bonds and Lifetime Mortgage advances.
The Groups other segments include regulated advice and intermediary services, and professional services to corporates.
The Groups corporate activities are primarily involved in managing the Groups liquidity, capital and investment activities.
During the year, the Group reviewed the presentation of its segmental reporting in relation to the operating results of those companies within the insurance segment providing non-advised services, regulated advice and intermediary services, and the provision of licensed software to financial advisers, and the operating results of the other group companies which are included within Corporate activities.
Theoperating results of these companies have been reclassified to a new line item within operating profit, Other Group companies operating result.
In the prior year, the operating result of these companies was included within operating profit within Operating experience and assumption changes.
Accordingly, operating losses of 7.5m have been reclassified in the prior year segmental note from Operating experience and assumption changes to Other Group companies operating result.
Of this amount, 2.2m relates to the insurance segment and 5.3m relates to Corporate activities.
In addition, intra-Group interest on Tier 2 loans within Corporate activities has been reclassified from Operating experience and assumption changes to Reinsurance and financing costs.
Accordingly, 9.5m of intra-Group interest income previously reported within Operating experience and assumption changes within Corporate activities for the year to 30 June 2014, has been reclassified to Reinsurance and financing costs.
There is no net impact to Underlying operating profit, Operating profit before tax, Profit before corporate costs and before tax, or Profit loss before tax from these changes.
The Group operates in one material geographical segment which is the UK.

In the Budget on 8 July 2015, the Chancellor announced additional planned reductions to 18% by 2020.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly, although there will be no material effect.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 June 2015 have been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the Consolidated statement of financial position date.
Taxation of life insurance companies was fundamentally changed following the publication of the Finance Act 2012.
From 1 January 2013, life insurance tax is based on financial statements: prior to this date, the basis for profits chargeable to corporation tax was surplus arising within the Pillar 1 regulatory regime.
Cumulative differences arising between the two bases, which represent the differences in retained profits and taxable surplus which are not excluded items for taxation, are brought back into the computation of taxable profits.
However, legislation provides for transitional arrangements whereby such differences are amortised on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period from 1 January 2013.
The tax charge for the period to 30 June 2015 includes profits chargeable to corporation tax arising from this amortisation of 14.7m 2014: 14.7m.

Impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets at least annually.
Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units as follows.
30 June 30 June 2015 2014 m m Insurance operating segment 32.8 32.8 Total goodwill 32.8 32.8 The recoverable amounts of goodwill have been determined from value in use.
The key assumptions of this calculation are noted below.
2015 Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years Discount rate 12% The value in use of the insurance operating segment is considered by reference to latest business plans over the next five years, and astressed scenario that assumes no growth in sales for the next five years and discount rate of 20%.
The outcome of the impairment assessment under both scenarios is that the goodwill in respect of the insurance operating segment is not impaired and that the value inuse is higher than the carrying value of goodwill.
Any reasonable possible changes in assumption will not cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts.

The Groups financial investments are summarised by measurement category as follows.
30 June 30 June 2015 2014 m m Fair value through profit or loss Loans secured by mortgages 3,471.8 2,749.4 Other financial investments 5,022.9 4,740.6 Total financial investments 8,494.7 7,490.0 All financial investments measured at fair value through the profit or loss are designated as such on initial recognition or, in the case of derivative financial assets, are classified as held for trading.

Units in liquidity funds comprise wholly of units in funds which invest in cash and cash equivalents.
Deposits with credit institutions with a carrying value of 18.0m 2014: 29.2m have been pledged as collateral in respect of the Groups derivative financial instruments.
Amounts pledged as collateral are deposited with the derivative counterparty.
Of the above financial investments, 4,453.8m 2014: 4,146.2m is expected to be recovered more than one year after the Consolidated statement of financial position date.
a Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets: Quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which very little information is released publicly: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability: and Market-corroborated inputs.
Where the Group uses broker asset manager quotes and no information as to observability of inputs is provided by the broker asset manager, the investments are classified as follows: Where the broker asset manager price is validated by using internal models with market-observable inputs and the values are similar, the investment is classified as Level 2: and In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker asset manager prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers asset managers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
The majority of the Groups debt securities held at fair value and financial derivatives are valued using independent pricing services or third party broker quotes, and therefore classified as Level 2.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same where an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Unobservable inputs reflect the same assumptions as those that the market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Groups assets and liabilities held at fair value which are valued using valuation techniques for which significant observable market data is not available and classified as Level 3 include loans secured by mortgages, asset-backed securities, and investment contract liabilities.
The valuation of loans secured by mortgages is determined using an internal model which projects future cash flows expected to arise from each loan.
Future cash flows allow for assumptions relating to future expenses, future mortality experience, costs arising from no-negative equity guarantees and voluntary redemptions.
The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at a swap rate plus a liquidity premium.
During the year the internal model used to value the loans secured by mortgages has been recalibrated in respect of the liquidity premium added to the swap rate.
Previously the liquidity premium was considered to be unobservable and was therefore set at zero.
This gave rise to a day-one gain which was deferred and recognised over the expected life of the loan.
The recalibration process has reassessed the level of the liquidity premium and this is now considered to be an observable input to the internal model.
As such, the value of the liquidity premium added to the swap rate used to discount each of the mortgages has been updated with a weighted average liquidity premium used for the year to 30 June 2015 being 183bps.
As a result of the recalibration, a day-one gain no longer arises, and profit is recognised over the term of the contract.
There is no longer any aggregate difference yet to be recognised in profit or loss between the fair value of the mortgages at initial recognition and the amount that would have been determined at that date using the valuation technique.
Financial statements 112 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 15 Financial investments continued There was no difference arising between the value of the mortgages previously reported at 30 June 2014 and the value arising using the recalibrated model.
Therefore there is no impact on the fair value of the mortgage assets recognised at 30 June 2014 arising from this change.
The Level 3 bonds are asset-backed securities.
Such securities are valued using discounted cash flow analyses using prudent assumptions based on the repayment of the underlying loan.
Investment contract liabilities are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future Retirement Income benefits and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of the contract.

Redemption and defaults All debt securities classified as Level 3 are asset-backed securities.
The assumptions are that the underlying loans supporting the securities are redeemed in the future in a similar profile to the existing redemptions on an average rate of 3% per annum, and that default levels on the underlying basis remain at the current level of the Groups bond portfolio.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity on profit before tax to changes in default assumptions and redemption profiles in respect of Level 3 debt securities is not material.

Loans secured by mortgages are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
The loans are not expected to be recovered within 12months of the Consolidated statement of financial position date because the loans are lifetime mortgages and significant levels of early redemption are not anticipated.
The change in fair value of loans secured by mortgages recognised in profit or loss during the period is a gain of 369.5m 2014: gain of 145.8m.
In the prior year, the fair value of loans secured by mortgages was calculated by discounting the future cash flows at swap rates together with a nil liquidity premium, and the difference between the fair value at transaction date and the transaction price was recognised and deferred over the expected life of each loan.
In the current year, the fair value of loans secured by mortgages is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at a swap rate plus an observable liquidity premium.
The liquidity premium is calculated at the completion date for each policy such that, at outset, the value is equal to the face value of the loan.
There is no longer any difference arising between the fair value of loans secured by mortgages at transaction date and the transaction price.
The movement in the aggregate difference yet to be recognised in profit or loss between the fair value of mortgages and the amount that would have been recognised using the valuation technique is shown below.

Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the loans secured by mortgages All gains and losses arising from loans secured by mortgages are largely dependent on the term of the mortgage, which in turn is determined by the longevity of the customer.
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of loans secured by mortgages include the following: Maintenance expenses Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Groups recent expense analyses.
The assumed future expense levels incorporate an annual inflation rate allowance of 3.8% 2014: 3.9%.
Mortality Mortality assumptions have been derived by reference to appropriate standard mortality tables.
These tables have been adjusted to reflect the expected future mortality experience of mortgage contract holders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the sales process and the Groups assessment of how this experience will develop in the future.
This assessment takes into consideration relevant industry and population studies, published research materials, input from the Groups lead reinsurer and managements own experience.
Property prices The value of a property at the date of valuation is calculated by taking the latest valuation for that property and indexing this value using the Nationwide quarterly index for the propertys region.
Voluntary redemptions Assumptions for future voluntary redemption levels are based on the Groups recent analyses and external benchmarking, and the assumed redemption rate for policies in their first year is 0.6% 2014: 0.6%.
Sensitivity analysis Changes to unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in the fair value of the assets.
The Group has estimated the impact on profit for the period in changes to these inputs as follows.
Loans secured by mortgages valuation assumptions Maintenance Voluntary expenses Mortality Property redemptions Net increase decrease in profit before tax m 10% -5% prices -10% -10% 30 June 2015 4.1 15.3 26.1 14.3 30 June 2014 0.6 2.8 5.0 2.7 The sensitivity factors are applied via actuarial models.
The analysis has been prepared for a change in each variable with other assumptions remaining constant.
In reality such an occurrence is unlikely due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represents the Groups view of reasonably possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that there is a parallel shift in interest rates at all durations.

Prior to admission the Company completed a reverse acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Just Retirement Group Holdings Limited JRGHL.
Prior to the reverse acquisition the issued debt and equity of JRGHL was converted to JRGHL ordinary shares which were subsequently acquired by JRG through a share-for-share exchange, as detailed below.

There is an option at outset to select a lower sum at maturity and regular income until the earlier of death or maturity.
Upon death of the policyholder and subject to the option selected at the outset, there may be a return of premium less income received or income payable to a dependant until the death of that dependant.
b Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of investment contracts Valuation discount rates Valuation discount rate assumptions for investment contracts are set with regards to yields on supporting assets.
An explicit allowance forcredit risk is included by making an explicit deduction from the yields on debt and other fixed income securities based on historical default experience of each asset class.
Because the expected cash inflows from the supporting assets closely match the expected cash flows arising from the investment contracts, the derived discount rate reflects the characteristics of the investment contracts in terms oftiming, currency and liquidity.
The changes in the valuation discount rates reflect the changes in yields on the supporting assets.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivatives in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
The interest rate swaps are not designated as a hedge and changes in their fair value are included in profit or loss.
Derivatives are used to manage the Groups European Embedded Value and regulatory capital, which is affected by a surplus of long-dated fixed interest securities when liabilities are measured on a realistic basis.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions are conducted under standardised International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. ISDA master agreements, and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.

Individually underwritten GIfL business is reinsured by quota share treaties, where apercentage of the liability under the reinsured policies written, determined on the Pillar 1 basis, is ceded to the reinsurers who deposit back an amount calculated to cover the credit risk that would otherwise be borne by Just Retirement Limited.
Since 1 March 2015, GIfL business which has been underwritten using PrognoSys is 45% reinsured via a longevity swap contract in addition to amounts reinsured under the quota share treaties.
In addition to the reinsurance of the mortality risk, Just Retirement Limited receives a benefit for Pillar 1 solvency purposes, because the reinsurance premium paid to the reinsurers represents less than 100% of the value of the reinsured liabilities on the treaty basis with the resultant capital benefit utilised as solvency capital in determining the regulatory Pillar 1 solvency of Just Retirement Limited.
The resultant benefit is treated as a liability in the financial statements and its repayment is contingent upon the emergence of surplus under Pillar 1 valuation rules.
The amount of deposits received from reinsurers that is expected to be settled more than one year after the Consolidated statement of financial position date is 2,292.5m 2014: 3,207.2m.
During the period the Group recaptured business in respect of certain underwriting years in respect of its quota share treaty with Hannover Re.
The recapture resulted in a decrease in ceded liabilities of 950.9m 2014: 263.1m and a reduction in the deposit back of 950.9m 2014: 263.1m.
Other treaties remain in-force in respect of these underwriting years, so a proportion of liabilities for these years remain reinsured, although for the business recaptured the Group now solely bears the risks and rewards in respect of that business.
DB business is reinsured on a scheme-by-scheme basis via a longevity swap contract which transfers 55% of risk to the reinsurer.
Care Plan business is reinsured via a longevity swap contract which transfers 90% of the risk to the reinsurer.

33 Financial and insurance risk management This note presents information about the major financial and insurance risks to which the Group is exposed, and its objectives, policies and processes for their measurement and management.
Financial risk comprises exposure to market, credit and liquidity risk.
a Insurance risk The writing of long-term insurance contracts requires a range of assumptions to be made and risk arises from these assumptions being materially inaccurate.
The Groups main insurance risk arises from adverse experience compared with the assumptions used in pricing products and valuing insurance liabilities, and in addition its reinsurance treaties may be terminated, not renewed, or renewed on terms less favourable than those under existing treaties.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to longevity, mortality and morbidity and exposure to factors such as withdrawal levels and management and administration expenses.
Individually underwritten GIfL are priced using assumptions about future longevity that are based on historic experience information, lifestyle and medical factors relevant to individual customers, and judgements about the future development of longevity improvements.
In the event of an increase in longevity, the actuarial reserve required to make future payments to customers may increase.
Loans secured by mortgages are used to match some of the liabilities arising from the sale of GIfL and DB business.
In the event that early repayments in a given period are higher than anticipated, less interest will have accrued on the mortgages and the amount repayable will be less than assumed at the time of sale.
In the event of an increase in longevity, although more interest will have accrued and the amount repayable will be greater than assumed at the time of the sale, the associated cash flows will be received later than had originally been anticipated.
In addition, a general increase in longevity would have the effect of increasing the total amount repayable, which would increase the LTV ratio and could increase the risk of failing to be repaid in full as a consequence of the no-negative equity guarantee.
There is also morbidity risk exposure as the contract ends when the customer moves into long-term care.
Underpinning the management of insurance risk are: TM The development and use of medical information PrognoSys for both pricing and reserving to provide detailed insight into longevity risk: Adherence to approved underwriting requirements: Controls around the development of suitable products and their pricing: Review and approval of assumptions used by the Actuarial Function Holder and the Board: Regular monitoring and analysis of actual experience: Use of reinsurance to minimise volatility of capital requirement and profit: and Monitoring of expense levels.
Concentrations of insurance risk Concentration of insurance risk comes from improving longevity.
Improved longevity arises from enhanced medical treatment and improved life circumstances.
Concentration risk is managed by writing business across a wide range of different medical and lifestyle conditions to avoid excessive exposure.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 | 125 33 Financial and insurance risk management continued b Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss or of adverse change in the financial situation resulting, directly or indirectly, from fluctuations in the level and in the volatility of market prices of assets, liabilities and financial instruments, together with the impact of changes in interest rates.
Significant market risk is implicit in the insurance business and arises from exposure to interest rate risk, property risk, inflation risk and currency risk.
The Group is not exposed to any equity risk or material currency risk.
Market risk represents both upside and downside impacts but the Groups policy to manage market risk is to limit downside risk.
Falls inthe financial markets can reduce the value of pension funds available to purchase Retirement Income products, and changes in interest rates can affect the relative attractiveness of Retirement Income products.
Changes in the value of the Groups investment portfolio will also affect the Groups financial position.
In mitigation, Retirement Income product monies are invested to match the asset and liability cash flows as closely as practicable.
Inpractice it is not possible to eliminate market risk fully as there are inherent uncertainties surrounding many of the assumptions underlying the projected asset and liability cash flows.
For each of the material components of market risk, described in more detail below, the market risk policy sets out the risk appetite and management processes governing how each risk should be measured, managed, monitored and reported.
i Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its impact on the value of, or income from, specific assets, liabilities or both.
It seeks to limit its exposure through appropriate asset and liability matching and hedging strategies.
The Groups exposure to changes in interest rates is concentrated in the investment portfolio, loans secured by mortgages and its insurance obligations.
Changes in investment and loan values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the value of insurance liabilities.
The Group monitors this exposure through regular reviews of the asset and liability position, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and scenario analyses.
Interest rate risk is also managed using derivative instruments e. g. swaps and swaptions.
The following table indicates the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates for the Groups significant financial assets.
Less than One to Five to Over No one year five years ten years ten years fixed term Total 30 June 2015 m m m m m m Units in liquidity funds 280.2 280.2 Debt securities and other fixed income securities 270.9 1,229.1 1,377.4 1,796.4 4,673.8 Deposits with credit institutions 18.0 18.0 Derivative financial assets 6.3 29.5 15.1 50.9 Loans secured by mortgages 3,471.8 3,471.8 Total 569.1 1,235.4 1,406.9 1,811.5 3,471.8 8,494.7 Less than One to Five to Over No one year five years ten years ten years fixed term Total 30 June 2014 m m m m m m Units in liquidity funds 341.2 341.2 Debt securities and other fixed income securities 224.0 1,290.4 1,372.9 1,440.6 4,327.9 Deposits with credit institutions 29.2 29.2 Derivative financial assets 30.2 12.1 42.3 Loans secured by mortgages 2,749.4 2,749.4 Total 594.4 1,290.4 1,403.1 1,452.7 2,749.4 7,490.0 Financial statements 126 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Financial and insurance risk management continued ii Property risk The Groups exposure to property risk arises from indirect exposure to the UK residential property market through the provision of lifetime mortgages.
A substantial decline or sustained underperformance in UK residential property prices, against which the Groups lifetime mortgages are secured, could result in proceeds on sale being exceeded by the mortgage debt at the date of redemption.
Demand may also reduce for lifetime mortgage products through reducing consumers propensity to borrow and by reducing the amount they are able to borrow due to reductions in property values and the impact on loan-to-value limits.
The risk is mitigated by ensuring that the advance represents a low proportion of the propertys value at outset and independent third party valuations are undertaken on each property before initial mortgages are advanced.
Lifetime mortgage contracts are also monitored through dilapidation reviews.
House prices are monitored and the impact of exposure to adverse house prices both regionally and nationally is regularly reviewed.
iii Inflation risk Inflation risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets or liabilities or both in combination, arising from relative or absolute changes in inflation or in the volatility of inflation.
Exposure to inflation occurs in relation to the Groups own management expenses and its matching of index-linked Retirement Income products.
Its impact is managed through the application of disciplined cost control over its management expenses and through matching its index-linked assets and index-linked liabilities for the inflation risk associated with its index-linked Retirement Income products.
iv Currency risk Currency risk arises from fluctuations in the value of, or income from, assets denominated in foreign currencies, from relative or absolute changes in foreign exchange rates or in the volatility of exchange rates.
Exposure to currency risk could arise from the Groups investment in non-sterling denominated assets.
From time to time, the Group acquires fixed income securities denominated in US dollars or other foreign currencies for its financial asset portfolio.
All Group liabilities are in sterling.
As the Group does not wish to introduce foreign exchange risk into its investment portfolio, derivative or quasi-derivative contracts are entered into to eliminate the foreign exchange exposure as far as possible.
c Credit risk Credit risk arises if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group, including failing to perform them in a timely manner.
Credit risk exposures arise from: Holding fixed income investments where the main risks are default and market risk.
The risk of default where the counterparty fails to pay back the capital and or interest on a corporate bond is mitigated by investing only in higher quality or investment grade assets.
Market risk is the risk of bond prices falling as a result of concerns over the counterparty, or over the market or economy in which the issuing company operates.
This leads to wider spreads the difference between redemption yields and a risk-free return, the impact of which is mitigated through the use of a hold to maturity strategy.
Concentration of credit risk exposures is managed by placing limits on exposures to individual counterparties and limits on exposures to credit rating levels.
The Group also manages credit risk on its corporate bond portfolio through the appointment of specialist fund managers, who execute a diversified investment strategy, investing in investment-grade assets and imposing individual counterparty limits.
Current economic and market conditions are closely monitored, as are spreads on the bond portfolio in comparison with benchmark data.
Counterparties in derivative contracts the Group uses financial instruments to mitigate interest rate and currency risk exposures.
It therefore has credit exposure to various counterparties through which it transacts these instruments, although this is usually mitigated by collateral arrangements see note 25.
Reinsurance reinsurance is used to manage longevity risk but, as a consequence, credit risk exposure arises should a reinsurer fail to meet its claim repayment obligations.
Credit risk on reinsurance balances is mitigated by the reinsurer depositing back more than 100% of premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement.
Cash balances credit risk on cash assets is managed by imposing restrictions over the credit ratings of third parties with whom cash is deposited.
Credit risk credit risks for loans secured by mortgages has been considered within property risk above.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 | 127 33 Financial and insurance risk management continued The following table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure for financial assets of the Group, which are neither past due nor impaired at 30 June.

The carrying amount of those assets subject to credit risk represents the maximum credit risk exposure.
d Liquidity risk The investment of Retirement Income cash in corporate bonds, gilts and lifetime mortgages, and commitments to pay policyholders and other obligations, requires liquidity risks to be taken.
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss because the Group, although solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to it in order to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
Exposure to liquidity risk arises from: Deterioration in the external environment caused by economic shocks, regulatory changes or reputational damage: Realising assets to meet liabilities during stressed market conditions: Increasing cash flow volatility in the short term giving rise to mismatches between cash flows from assets and requirements from liabilities: Needing to support liquidity requirements for day-to-day operations: Ensuring financial support can be provided across the Group: and Maintaining and servicing collateral requirements arising from the changes in market value of financial derivatives used by the Group.
Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that assets of a suitable maturity and marketability are held to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups short-term liquidity requirements are wholly funded by advance Retirement Income premium payments and investment coupon receipts out of which contractual payments need to be made.
There are significant barriers for policyholders to withdraw funds that have already been paid to the Group in the form of premiums.
Cash outflows associated with Retirement Income liabilities can be reasonably estimated and liquidity can be arranged to meet this expected outflow through asset-liability matching and new business premiums.
Financial statements 128 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Financial and insurance risk management continued The cash flow characteristics of the lifetime mortgages are reversed when compared with Retirement Income products, with cash flows effectively representing an advance payment, which is eventually funded by repayment of principal plus accrued interest.
Policyholders are able to redeem mortgages, albeit at a cost.
The mortgage assets are considered illiquid, as they are not readily saleable due to the uncertainty about their value and the lack of a market in which to trade them.
Cash flow forecasts over the short, medium and long terms are regularly prepared to predict and monitor liquidity levels in line with limits set on the minimum amount of liquid assets required.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the financial liabilities, including both principal and interest payments, of the Group based on remaining undiscounted contractual obligations.

These regulatory requirements apply to individual regulated subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis and in respect of the Group as a whole, and apply to different levels within the Group and on different bases.
The amount of regulatory and economic capital required also depends on the level of risk facing the insurance and other subsidiaries in the Group, and as such correlates to economic market cycles.
The Group must assess its capital resources on both a Pillar 1 regulatory capital and a Pillar 2 individual capital assessment basis and must hold sufficient qualifying regulatory capital to satisfy both tests.
Pillar 1 capital requirement is calculated by applying fixed percentages to reserves in accordance with the PRA General Prudential Sourcebook, whereas the Pillar 2 capital requirement is determined following an individual capital assessment by the Group, which is then reviewed by the PRA.
The Group may also be required by the PRA to hold capital over and above that required to satisfy the Pillar 1 and 2 requirements and its Group risk profile.
The Groups capital position can be adversely affected by a number of factors, in particular factors that erode the Groups capital resources and or which impact the quantum of risk to which the Group is exposed.
In addition, any event which erodes current profitability and is expected to reduce future profitability and or make profitability more volatile could impact the Groups capital position, which in turn could have a negative effect on the Groups results of operations.
