An overview of the scope of our audit Our group audit scope focused on the groups principal operating locations being Loulo and Gounkoto in Mali, Tongon in Cte dIvoire and Kibali in the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC, each of which was subject to a full scope audit.
The four principal operating locations include one joint venture Kibali.
Together with the parent company and its group consolidation, which were also subject to a full scope audit, these locations represent the principal business units of the group and account for 100% of the groups revenue, approximately 96% of the groups profit before income tax and approximately 99% of the groups total assets.
Whilst materiality for the financial statements as a whole was $19.0 million, each component of the group was audited to a lower level of materiality.
Audits of these components were performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned.
The audits of each of these components were principally performed in Mali Loulo and Gounkoto mines, the DRC Kibali mine and Cte dIvoire Tongon mine, as well as the audit of corporate accounting functions in Jersey and South Africa.
All of the audits were conducted by BDO LLP.
As part of our audit strategy, the Responsible Individual or senior members of the audit team visit each of the four principal operating locations each year.
The remaining components of the group include the Morila joint venture and non-significant holding companies and these components were principally subject to analytical review procedures, together with additional substantive testing at Morila over certain audit risk areas.
Our assessment of and response to risks of material misstatement There have been no significant changes in the groups operations, and while our assessment of materiality has decreased see below for further details, the assessed risks of material misstatement described below, which are those that had the greatest impact on our audit strategy and scope, are substantially the same as in the prior year.
We have set out below how we addressed these risks: RISK IDENTIFIED AUDIT RESPONSE Taxation claims We critically reviewed the groups mining conventions, arbitration As detailed in notes 3 and 19, the groups Malian operations are subject to submissions for the relevant claims and correspondence with the State historic taxation claims by the State of Mali totalling $280.0 million.

We have obtained confirmations from local and international legal and tax advisors which supported the directors assessment that the material claims were without legal merit and assessed as remote under IFRS.
In relying upon the assessments made by such experts, we evaluated the competence and objectivity of professional advisors relied upon by management.

judgements added to the risk for our audit.
The report of the audit committee describes the audit committees assessment of each of these risks.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.
We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis RANDGOLD RESOURCES ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 RANDGOLD RESOURCES F-4 F-5 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS CONTINUED of the financial statements.
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be $19.0 million, which equated to 7.3% of profit before income tax and represents less than 0.1% of equity.
We consider profit before income tax to be the most significant determinant of the groups financial performance used by shareholders and other users and therefore consider this an appropriate basis for materiality.
Our materiality is lower than the level we set for the year ended 31 December 2014 $26.0 million due to the lower profits of the group.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all individual audit differences identified during the course of our audit in excess of $0.7 million 2014: $0.8 million.
We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following: Under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: proper accounting records have not been kept by the company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the companys financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns: or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the companys compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
Statement regarding the directors assessment of principal risks, going concern and longer term viability of the company As required under ISAs UK and Ireland we have nothing material to add or to draw attention to in relation to: the directors confirmation in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity: the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated: the directors statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entitys ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements: or the directors explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors As explained more fully in the statement of directors responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The directors are responsible for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The group depreciates the deferred costs capitalised as stripping assets on a unit of production method, with reference to the ex-pit ore treated from the relevant ore body component or phase.
Commercial production The group assesses the stage of each mine construction project to determine when a mine moves into the production stage.
The criteria Short-lived assets used to assess the start date are determined by the unique nature of each Short-lived assets including non-mining assets are shown at cost less mine construction project and include factors such as the complexity of accumulated depreciation and impairment.

Provision for environmental rehabilitation GROUP $000 31 Dec 2015 31 Dec 2014 Opening balance 55 904 49 177 Unwinding of discount 1 397 1 229 Change in estimates 9 720 5 498 At 31 December 47 581 55 904 As at 31 December 2015, $22.3 million of the provision relates to Loulo 31 December 2014: $28.2 million, $18.8 million 2014: $21.0 million of the provision relates to Tongon, while $6.5 million relates to Gounkoto 2014: $6.7 million.
The provisions for rehabilitation costs include estimates for the effect of inflation and changes in estimates and have been discounted to their present value at 2.25% 2014: 2.0% per annum, being an estimate equivalent to the risk free rate determined with reference to US government bonds with maturity dates comparable to the estimated rehabilitation of the mines.
Rehabilitation cash flows are risk adjusted.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali and Cte dIvoire to govern the mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its mines.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current LoM plans envisage the expected outflow to occur at the end of the LoM which is 2028 for Loulo, 2021 for Tongon and 2025 for Gounkoto.
Employment cost The group contributes to several defined contribution provident funds.
The provident funds are funded on the money accumulative basis with the members and company having been fixed in the constitutions of the funds.
All the groups employees, other than those directly employed by West African subsidiary companies, are entitled to be covered by the above mentioned retirement benefit plans.
Retirement benefits for employees employed by West African subsidiary companies are provided by the state social security system to which the company and employees contribute a fixed percentage of payroll costs each month.

Restricted shares issued to employees Restricted shares issued to employees are subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of shares.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is defined as level 3 on the companys performance management system.
All employees to whom restricted shares have been granted are expected to meet this level of performance.
The performance period is typically up to five years where the employee must remain in employment for the shares to vest.
There are no market based vesting conditions on the share awards.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2015 and 2014 are detailed below and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The restricted shares have an exercise price of nil.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2015 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The key assumptions used in this model for shares granted during the year ending 31 December 2015 were as follows: GROUP NOTE January 2015 August 2015 Quantity of shares issued 191 000 95 300 Fair value of shares issued $15.6 million $5.5 million Performance period 3, 4 and 5 years 3, 4 and 5 years Volatility 15.1 35.2%, 35.6% and 33.7% 24.3%, 24.3% and 24.3% Risk-free interest rate 0.9%, 1.4% and 1.4% 0.9%, 1.6% and 1.6% Dividend yield 0.62% 0.98% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 15.2 $83.8 $60.37 Weighted average exercise price - - 15.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares on each grant date.
15.2 Weighted average share price for the valuation is calculated taking into account the market price on all grant dates.
The market price at the award dates was $68.4 and $85.9 respectively and vested over three, four and five years in equal tranches.
The volatility, risk free rate and dividend yield had no significant impact on fair value but were consistent with those above.
The total fair value of the awards was $35.0 million over the vesting periods.
RANDGOLD RESOURCES ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 F-26 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15.
EMPLOYMENT COST CONTINUED Restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 The restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 were subject to directors remaining employed, as well as being subject to a market performance condition, being the companys relative TSR performance over three years against the HSBC Global Gold Index since renamed the Euromoney Global Gold Index.
This was assessed and had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The fair value of the restricted shares was based on the share price on the grant date and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
Details of the awards that vested and lapsed in the year are shown on page 212 to 213 of this annual report, together with details of the award dates and market prices at award and vesting dates.
Restricted share awards granted to executive directors in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 The Restricted Share Scheme for 2011, 2012 and 2013 operates with conditional share awards, where the awards will vest in three equal one-third tranches subject to the fulfilment of performance conditions measured on an annual basis.
Shares awarded in 2015 and 2014 are subject to one four-year performance period of assessment.
If the performance conditions are met, awards vest at the end of each performance period.
The 2011, 2012 and 2013 awards are subject to four performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, EPS growth, additional reserves and absolute reserves.
The 2014 awards are subject to three performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, EPS growth and additional reserves.
The 2015 awards are subject to three performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, total cash cost per ounce and additional reserves.
Grant date fair value was calculated using the market-based measure.
No dividends are attributable during the vesting period.
Refer to the remuneration report on pages 188 to 214 of this annual report for more detail.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2015 and 2014 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The key assumptions used in this model for shares awarded during the years ending 31 December 2015 and 2014 were as follows: GROUP NOTE March 2015 March 2014 Quantity of shares issued 55 782 49 174 Fair value of shares awarded $2.0 million $2.1 million Performance period 4 years and a 1 year post vesting 4 years and a 1 year post vesting retention requirement retention requirement Risk free interest rate 1.45% 1.32% Volatility 15.1 35% 40% Euromoney Global Gold Index volatility 35% 34% Correlation used between the Euromoney Global Gold Index and the company TSR 85% 80% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 15.2 $67.41 $79.75 15.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares over the relevant vesting periods.
CEO performance shares At the companys annual general meeting in 2013, shareholders approved a one-off award of performance shares to the CEO.
The vesting of the performance shares is subject to the achievement of the conditions set out on page 207 of this annual report and the CEO continuing to hold office or employment with the company during the period of three years from 29 April 2013, the date of grant of the award of performance shares.
The fair value was determined at $4.0 million.
At 31 December 2015, four out of five of the performance conditions have been met.
Accordingly, the performance condition in respect of 10 006 shares was met at a value of $71.54 per share in 2013 and the performance conditions in respect of 30 018 shares, comprising three tranches each of 10 006 shares, were met at a value of $67.41 per share in 2014.

The maximum commitment which may be made is 250% and 200% of base salary by the CEO and 125% and 100% of base salary by the CFO for 2015 and 2014 respectively.
Committed shares must be retained for three years and may be matched, depending on relative TSR performance over three years against the Euromoney Global Gold Index.
If after three years the TSR performance of the company equals or exceeds the performance of the Euromoney Global Gold Index, then the committed shares may be matched on a stepped scale.
Refer to the Compensation section of the annual report for further details.
The maximum level of matching is one-for-one.
The vesting of the award is dependent on the companys TSR performance relative to the Euromoney Global Gold Index.
The fair value of awards made under the Co-Investment Plan in 2015 and 2014 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The key assumptions used in this model for awards made under the Co-Investment Plan during the years ending 31 December 2015 and 2014 were as follows: GROUP NOTE March 2015 March 2014 Quantity of shares committed 69 726 49 174 Fair value $2.6 million $2.0 million Performance period 3 years 3 years Risk free interest rate 0.89% 0.80% Volatility 15.1 35% 40% Euromoney Global Gold Index volatility 35% 34% Correlation used between the Euromoney Global Gold Index and the company TSR 85% 80% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 15.2 $74.0 $79.75 15.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares over the relevant vesting periods.

Segmental information Operating segments have been identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments included in internal reports are determined on the basis of their significance to the group.
In particular, operating mines are reported as separate segments and exploration projects that have significant capitalised expenditure or other fixed assets are also reported separately.
The Kibali and Morila joint ventures are included on a line by line basis, reflecting internal reporting.
Other parts of the group, including the RAL 1 Limited, RAL 2 Limited and KAS 1 Limited joint ventures, are included with corporate and exploration.
The groups chief operating decision maker is considered by management to be the board of directors.
An analysis of the groups business segments, excluding intergroup transactions, is set out below.
Major customers are not identifiable because all gold is sold to an agent.
Financial risk management In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to gold price, currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
In order to manage these risks, the group may enter into transactions which make use of on-balance sheet derivatives.
The group does not acquire, hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The group has developed a risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
The board has approved and monitors this risk management process, inclusive of documented treasury policies, counterpart limits, controlling and reporting structures.
Controlling risk in the group The treasury committee is responsible for treasury financial risk management activities within the group.
The treasury committee reviews and recommends to the board all treasury counterparties, limits, instruments and any hedge strategies.
At least two members of the treasury committee need to be present for a decision to be made, one of whom needs to be an executive director.
Unless specific dispensation is obtained from the audit committee, the treasury committee is permitted to invest up to $50.0 million or 20% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with an investment rating of AAor higher noting that no institution can exceed $100.0 million.
The treasury committee is also permitted to invest up to $12.5 million or 5% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with an investment rating above A but below AA-, provided that no investment exceeds $25 million.
Approximately one third of the cash for the group was held with the groups principal bankers at year end with the remainder held with eight other financial institutions, in line with the treasury policy.
The treasury committee is responsible for managing investment, gold price, currency, liquidity and credit risk.
The treasury committee monitors adherence to treasury risk management policy and counterparty limits and provides regular reports to the board.
The financial risk management objectives of the group are defined as follows: Safeguarding the group core earnings stream from its major assets through the effective control and management of gold price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk: Ef fective and efficient usage of credit facilities in both the short and long term through the adoption of reliable liquidity management planning and procedures: Ensuring that investment and any hedging transactions are undertaken with creditworthy counterparties: and Ensuring that all contracts and agreements related to risk management activities are coordinated consistently throughout the group and comply where necessary with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.
The group continues to hold material TVA receivable balances in Mali.
While management continue to pursue recovery of the TVA in cash, it is recognised that in practice given the continued absence of payment, the TVA may only be recovered through the tax offset mechanism set out in the mining convention.
Management reports the TVA position and movements on a quarterly basis to the audit committee.
Refer to Key risks and uncertainties on page 181 to 184 of the annual report for details on the groups risk factors.
Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily euro, South African rand and Communaut Financire Africaine franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into any material derivatives to manage these currency risks and no significant positions were held in 2015 and 2014.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and gold was sold at market spot prices in 2014 and 2015.
Gold sales are made in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a fixed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
The group is also exposed to fluctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, steel, rubber, cyanide and lime, mainly due to changes in the price of oil, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates.

The sensitivities do not take into account the groups sales and costs and the results of the sensitivities could change due to other factors such as changes in the value of financial assets and liabilities as a result of non-foreign exchange influenced factors.
Interest rate and liquidity risk Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on financing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
The company maintains a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with HSBC and a syndicate of banks which matures in December 2018 and is at present undrawn.
Based on the companys current cash resources and available facilities, projected operating cash flows and capital expenditure, we are confident the company will be able to meet its obligations at the present gold price.
The facility, if drawn, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, at the lower end of the leverage grid and includes financial covenants in respect of EBIT, EBITDA, net finance charges, tangible net worth, total debt, debt cover and interest cover.

Concentration of credit risk The groups cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali and Cte dIvoire and in the case of its joint ventures in DRC and Mali.
The gold produced is sold to the largest accredited gold refinery in the world.
Credit risk is further managed by regularly reviewing the financial statements of the refinery.
The group is further not exposed to significant credit risk on gold sales, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
While not financial assets under IFRS 7, included in receivables is $102.9 million 2014: $106.8 million refer to note 7 relating to indirect taxes owing to Loulo, Gounkoto and Tongon by the State of Mali, which are denominated in FCFA, which holds some credit risk for the group.
The legally binding mining conventions in Mali permit offsetting of other corporate taxes against approved unpaid TVA.
A further $61.8 million 2014: $50.5 million is held within the underlying statement of financial position of the equity accounted Kibali joint venture which is considered recoverable given the receipts obtained during the year and absence of significant disputed items, albeit receipts, remain slow.
Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, buyback shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt net cash divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt net cash.

There have been no transfers between the levels of fair value hierarchy during the current or prior year.
Randgold does not hold any financial instruments that are fair valued using a level 2 or level 3 valuation.
No material derivative financial instruments currently exist.
All other financial instrument carrying values approximate fair value.
Estimation of fair values Trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, cash and cash equivalents, loans to and from subsidiaries and joint ventures The carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of the fair values because of the short maturity of such instruments or their interest bearing nature.

Interest expenses arise on borrowings measured at amortised cost.
Non-GAAP information Randgold has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the performance of the business.
As the measures are not defined under IFRS they may not be directly comparable with other companies adjusted measures.
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but management has included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
These measures are explained further below: Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non-GAAP measures.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute.
The Gold Institute was a non-profit industry association comprising leading gold producers, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers.
This institute has now been incorporated into the National Mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institutes guidance, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping where relevant and royalties.
Total cash costs and cash per ounce also include the companys share of equity accounted joint ventures total cash costs and cash cost per ounce.
Total cash cost per ounce is calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures.
The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
In particular depreciation and amortisation would be included in a measure of total costs of producing gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a definition for the calculation of total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, Randgold believes that total cash cost per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the companys operations mature, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties from total cash costs.
Cash operating cost per ounce is calculated by dividing cash operating costs by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Total cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce include our share of joint ventures total operating cash costs and operating cash cost per ounce.
Gold sales is a non-GAAP measure.
It represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains losses on hedge contracts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date.
It excludes gains losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales.
This adjustment is considered appropriate because no cash is received paid in respect of these contracts.
Randgold currently does not have any hedge positions.
Gold sales include our share of our equity accounted joint ventures gold sales.
Profit from mining activity is calculated by subtracting total cash costs from gold sales for all periods presented.
Profit from mining includes our share of our equity accounted joint ventures.
Gold on hand represents gold in dor at the mines multiplied by the prevailing spot gold price at the end of the period.
Gold on hand includes our share of our equity accounted joint ventures gold on hand.

Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Randgold does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements herein, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.
