Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information for shareholders DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2015 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GROUP: OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES b Principal risks and assumptions The material post employment plans are not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks but there are general risks: Inflation the majority of the plans obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to increased liabilities which is partially offset by holdings of inflation linked gilts and swaps and the plans provide for caps on the level of inflationary increases.
Interest rate The plan liabilities are determined using discount rates derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities though this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the bonds held by the post employment plans.
Mortality The majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members and their partners so any increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Asset returns Assets held by the pension plans are invested in a diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other assets.
Volatility in asset values will lead to movements in the net asset deficit reported in the consolidated balance sheet for post employment plans which in addition will also impact the post employment expense in the consolidated income statement.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

116 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GROUP: OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES c Investment and hedging strategy 2014 37% and 73% of the UK Schemes liabilities were hedged The investment strategy for the groups funded post employment against future movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, plans is decided locally by the trustees of the plan and or Diageo, through the combined effect of government bonds, repurchase as appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory agreements and swaps.
At 30 June 2015, approximately 32% and 59% requirements.
The objective of the investment strategy is to achieve 2014 33% and 52% of the Irish Schemes liabilities were hedged a target rate of return in excess of the movement on the liabilities, against future movements in interest rates and inflation, respectively, while taking an acceptable level of investment risk relative to the through the combined effect of government bonds, repurchase liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using the funds of the agreements and swaps.
The discount rates used are based on the yields of high quality plans to invest in a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver a target rate of return.
The majority of the fixed income investments.
For the UK plans, which represent investment strategies have significant amounts allocated to equities, approximately 69% of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group determined by reference to the yield curves of AA-rated corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows are similar of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Significant amounts are invested in to those of the plans.
A similar process is used to determine the bonds in order to provide a natural hedge against movements in the discount rates used for the non-UK plans.
At 30 June 2015, approximately 35% and 79% The fair value of plan assets is as follows: 2015 2014 United United United States and United States and Kingdom Ireland other Total Kingdom Ireland other Total million million million million million million million million Equities Quoted 812 395 254 1,461 1,222 433 249 1,904 Unquoted and private equity 297 2 18 317 281 2 22 305 Bonds Fixed-interest government 178 117 37 332 319 64 36 419 Inflation-linked government 826 133 9 968 857 100 4 961 Investment grade corporate 861 210 251 1,322 835 362 210 1,407 Non-investment grade 265 31 14 310 224 12 11 247 Loan securities 614 123 737 469 143 612 Repurchase agreements 1,980 1,980 710 710 Liability Driven Investment LDI 80 20 100 Property unquoted 665 83 10 758 525 75 8 608 Hedge funds 122 122 202 127 329 Interest rate and inflation swaps 801 50 751 295 60 235 Cash and other 145 9 73 227 147 7 59 213 Total bid value of assets 5,922 1,295 666 7,883 5,496 1,385 599 7,480 1 The asset classes include some cash holdings that are temporary.
