Segmental reporting During 2015 the Group reorganised its operational structure so that the management and resources of the business are better aligned with the delivery of the business objectives.
As a result the information reported to the Groups Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance has changed to focus on three new Business Delivery Teams, West Africa including non-operated producing European assets, East Africa and New Ventures.
Therefore the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 are West Africa: East Africa: and New Ventures.
The following tables present revenue, profit and certain asset and liability information regarding the Groups reportable business segments for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
The table for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been restated to reflect the new reportable segments of the business.

As the sales of oil and gas are made on global markets and are highly liquid, the Group does not place reliance on the largest customers mentioned above.
Unallocated expenditure and net liabilities include amounts of a corporate nature and not specifically attributable to a reportable segment.
The liabilities comprise the Groups external debt and other non-attributable corporate liabilities.
The unallocated capital expenditure for the period comprises the acquisition of non-attributable corporate assets.

The tax rate applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the UK corporation tax rate applicable to the Groups non-upstream UK profits.

These changes were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included, depending upon when deferred tax will reverse.
134 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 134 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 3 The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $1,802.0 million 2014: $1,642.1 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
The Group has recognised $55.7 million in deferred tax assets in relation to taxable losses 2014: $72.0 million : this is offset net of a deferred tax liability in respect of capitalised interest.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $8.5 million 2014: $21.2 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income During 2015 $42.3 million 2014: $91.0 million of tax has been recognised through other comprehensive income of which $43.2 million 2014: $89.5 million is current and $0.9 million 2014: $1.5 million is deferred tax relating to charges on cash flow hedges arising in the year.
Current tax assets As at 31 December 2015, current tax assets were $127.6 million 2014: $221.6 million of which $55.0 million 2014: $155.9 million relates to Norway, where 78% of exploration expenditure is refunded as a tax refund in the following year and $47.7 million 2014: $47.7 million relates to a tax overpayment in Ghana.

The consideration was 64 million $53.5 million, producing a profit after tax of $7.4 million and a loss before tax of $46.3 million.

In 2014, the Group completed the disposal of Brage Norway and the farm-down of Schooner and Ketch UK for net cash consideration of $8.4 million and $38.1 million respectively.
In 2014, it was determined that it was no longer probable that the contingent consideration, recorded on the farm-down of Ugandan assets in 2012, would be recoverable and as such the balance of $370.1 million was written off.
In 2014, the Group made a payment of $36.6 million in respect of certain indemnities granted on the farm-down of Tullows interest in Uganda.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
The goodwill balance results solely from the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on an acquisition, calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
As a result, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the related deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition are included in the group of CGUs.
The above table details the net impact of goodwill and the related deferred tax on the CGU.
In assessing goodwill for impairment the Group has compared the carrying value of goodwill and the carrying value of the related group of CGUs with the recoverable amounts of those CGUs.
The carrying value of goodwill and the related group of CGUs together was $264.5 million 2014: $419.8 million and the recoverable amount of the CGUs was $210.8 million 2014: $287.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $53.7 million 2014: $132.8 million.
The cumulative impairment is $186.5 million 2014: $132.8 million.
Key assumptions Recoverable reserves and resources Proven and probable reserves are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques.
The estimate is reviewed at least twice annually and is regularly reviewed by independent consultants.
Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Exploration discoveries and prospects A Value in Use VIU calculation was performed for discoveries.
The VIU was calculated using risked resources, a long-term oil price assumption of $90 bbl, estimated future costs and a discount rate of 10%.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions As discussed above the principal assumptions are oil price and discount rate.
A $10 bbl reduction in oil prices would increase the impairment charge by $115.1 million and a 1% increase in the discount rate would increase the impairment by $59.3 million.

Short-term borrowings, bank loans and most guarantees are secured by fixed and floating charges over the oil and gas assets of the Group.
In March 2015, the Company arranged an additional $200 million of commitments, increasing the Reserves Based Lending credit facility to $3.7 billion.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 31 October 2019, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
In March 2015, the Company arranged an additional $250 million of commitments, increasing the Revolving credit facility to $1,000 million.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
In February 2015, the Company reduced commitments under the Revolving Norwegian Exploration Finance facility by NOK 750 million to NOK 2,250 million.
The facility is used to finance certain exploration activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf which are eligible for a tax refund.
The facility is available for drawings until 31 December 2016, and its final maturity date is either the date the 2016 tax reimbursement claims are received or 31 December 2017, whichever is the earlier.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at NIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2015, the headroom under the three facilities amounted to $1,686 million: $686 million under the $3.7 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $1,000 million under the Revolving credit facility.
At the end of December 2014, the headroom under the three facilities amounted to $2,263 million: $1,513 million under the Reserves Based Lending credit facility and $750 million under the Revolving credit facility.
Capital management The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally-imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may put in place new debt facilities, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, engage in active portfolio management, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made to the capital management objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to equity.
Net debt is calculated as external borrowings, as shown above, less cash and cash equivalents.

com 141 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 Note 21.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives The Group is exposed to a variety of risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering its underlying oil and gas businesses.
The Group holds a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as well as a portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The use of derivative financial instruments derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored and reviewed internally on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the senior notes, the Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to be materially the same as their fair value.
The fair value of the senior notes, as determined using market values at 31 December 2015, was $884.0 million 2014: $1,101.3 million.
The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
No financial assets are impaired at the balance sheet date.
Fair values of derivative instruments All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with valuation changes recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives have been designated as a cash flow hedge.
Fair value is the amount for which the asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Where available fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The following provides an analysis of the Groups financial instruments measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All the Groups derivatives are Level 2 2014: Level 2.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during the year.
For financial instruments which are recognised on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest-level input which is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
142 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 142 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 3 Offset of financial assets and financial liabilities Deferred premiums on derivatives are settled at the same time as the maturity of the derivative contracts, with the cash flows settled on a net basis.
Netting agreements are also in place to enable the Group and its counterparties to set-off liabilities against available assets in the event that either party is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The following table provides the offsetting relationship within assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

Such commodity derivatives will tend to be priced using benchmarks, such as Dated Brent, D-1 Heren and M-1 Heren, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil and gas revenues respectively.
The Group hedges its estimated oil and gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its oil revenues from substantially all of its African oil interests and its gas revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, all of the Groups oil and gas derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The Groups oil and gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS 39 using regression analysis.
There is, however, the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
There is also the potential for a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges which arises from, among other factors, daily field production performance.
Income statement hedge summary Net gains from commodity derivative settlements during the period, included in the income statement, were $365.2 million 2014: $14.5 million loss note 2.

Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR, Sterling LIBOR and Norwegian NIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises senior notes, bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The Group hedges its floating interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2015 is a liability of $1.0 million 2014: $0.4 million asset.
Interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the table below.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, at 31 December 2015 and 2014 was as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 2015 Fixed rate Floating rate 2015 2014 Fixed rate Floating rate 2014 Cash at bank debt debt Total Cash at bank debt debt Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m US$ 258.2 1,600.0 2,557.3 3,899.1 216.6 1,600.0 1,522.4 2,905.8 Euro 28.4 28.4 16.8 16.8 Sterling 19.1 156.9 137.8 20.6 164.6 144.0 Other 50.0 60.8 10.8 65.0 134.9 69.9 355.7 1,600.0 2,775.0 4,019.3 319.0 1,600.0 1,821.9 3,102.9 Cash at bank consisted mainly of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.
Credit risk The Group has a credit policy that governs the management of credit risk, including the establishment of counterparty credit limits and specific transaction approvals.
The primary credit exposures for the Group are its receivables generated by the marketing of crude oil and amounts due from JV partners.
These exposures are managed at the corporate level.
The Groups crude sales are predominantly made to international oil market participants including the oil majors, trading houses and refineries.
JV partners are predominantly international major oil and gas market participants.
Counterparty evaluations are conducted utilising international credit rating agency and financial assessment.
Where considered appropriate security in the form of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, guarantees and credit insurance are employed to mitigate the risks.
The Group generally enters into derivative agreements with banks who are lenders under the Reserves Based Lending credit facility.
Security is provided under the facility agreement which mitigates non-performance risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Groups financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, current tax assets and other current assets, as at 31 December 2015 was $2,176.9 million 2014: $2,126.1 million.
144 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 144 Tullow Oil plc 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 3 Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US dollars all other countries, the operating currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also mainly denominated in Sterling and US dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in other currencies.
These exposures are often managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives.
There were no material foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2015 year-end 2014: nil.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2015, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $49.7 million in non-US dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents 2014: $54.3 million and 106.0 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities 2014: 106.0 million.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $107.2 million 2014: net liabilities of $110.4 million.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk using both shortand long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt financing plans and active portfolio management.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework covering the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices, different production rates from the Groups producing assets and delays to development projects.
In addition to the Groups operating cash flows, portfolio management opportunities are reviewed to potentially enhance the financial capability and flexibility of the Group.
In the currently low commodity price environment, the Group has taken appropriate action to reduce its cost base and had $1.9 billion of debt liquidity headroom at the end of 2015.
The Groups forecast, taking into account the risks described above, show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have sufficient financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable.
This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain.
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the period in which the change occurs.

UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs These are all-employee plans set up in the UK and Ireland, to enable employees to save out of salary up to prescribed monthly limits.
Contributions are used by the SIP trustees to buy Tullow shares Partnership Shares at the end of each three-month accumulation period.
The Company makes a matching contribution to acquire Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
Under the UK SIP, Matching Shares are subject to time-based forfeiture over three years on leaving employment in certain circumstances or if the related Partnership Shares are sold.
The fair value of a Matching Share is its market value when it is awarded.
Under the UK SIP: i Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of their market values at the start of the accumulation period and the purchase date which is treated as a three-month share option for IFRS 2 purposes and therefore results in an accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the three years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.
Under the Irish SIP: i Partnership Shares are bought at the market value at the purchase date which does not result in any accounting charge, and ii Matching Shares vest over the two years after being awarded resulting in their accounting charge being spread over that period.
