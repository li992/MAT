GOODWILL The goodwill carried in the accounts was recognised on the acquisition of The Business Mortgage Company and its subsidiaries TBMC in December 2008.
The cash generating unit to which this goodwill was attributed for impairment testing purposes was TBMC, which is the lowest level within the Group at which this goodwill is currently monitored, though the operations of the acquired entity will, in time, be integrated with those of the First Mortgage division.
An impairment review undertaken at 30 September 2009 indicated a write down of 6.0m which was charged to the profit and loss account.
Further reviews were undertaken at each year-end up to 30 September 2015 each of which indicated no further impairment.
The recoverable amount of TBMC used in this impairment testing is determined on a value in use basis using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering a four year period.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projection is 6.1% and cash flows beyond the four year budget are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate, being the average long term growth rate in the UK economy over a twenty year period.
