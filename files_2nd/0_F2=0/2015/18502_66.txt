Fidessa group plc 91 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Capital management The Board monitors the total equity, distributable reserves and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital along with when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
A strong capital base is maintained so as to provide employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in its subsidiaries businesses and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
Fidessa has strong cash generation due to being consistently profitable and non-acquisitive in nature.
The annual dividend has a pay-out ratio of approximately 45% which provides a reasonable return to shareholders whilst also providing funds for potential acquisitions and replenishing the cash balance.
However, in the absence of acquisitions, Fidessa has a track record of returning the additional cash to shareholders in the form of special dividends.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the financial instruments.
For receivables and payables the directors consider that the carrying amount approximates their fair value.
