EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM TOTAL AND CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY SHAREHOLDERS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares, 592,294,371 2014: 585,513,537, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares under the Groups Share Schemes, being 24,200,000 2014: 32,676,278, to give the diluted weighted average number of shares of 616,494,371 2014: 618,189,815.

Underlying earnings is used by management as a measure of profitability within the Group.
Underlying earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent for each financial period but excluding the post tax effect of certain non-trading items.
The Directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.

EVERYTHING IS CHANGING... NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 26 APRIL 2015 15.
The carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to the Groups operating segments before aggregation.
With the exception of Everlast, none of the individual cash-generating units CGUs are considered material to goodwill or indefinite life intangibles Brands.
The carrying value of goodwill and brands allocated to the Groups CGUs, as aggregated except in the case of Everlast, is shown below: Goodwill Brands 000 000 UK Sports Retail 6,964 8,500 International Sports Retail 33,395 - Premium Lifestyle 13,689 - Brands excl.
Everlast 48,048 - Everlast 54,438 71,385 156,534 79,885 The Group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying value might be impaired.
The carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.
Impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for each CGU to which the intangible assets are allocated.
A CGU is deemed to be an individual fascia and these have been grouped together into similar classes for the purpose of formulating operating segments as reported in note 4.
Value in use calculations are based on five year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector served by the CGUs.
ANNUAL REPORT 2015 The key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each CGU, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 26 April 2015 were as follows: UK Sports International Sports Premium Brands excl.
Retail Retail Lifestyle Everlast Everlast Sales growth 0%-5% 0%-10% 0%-5% 0% - 6% 0% - 5% Terminal sales growth 2% 0% - 2% 0% - 2% 0% - 2% 0% Gross margin 35% - 45% 35% - 50% 40% - 50% 15% - 50% 20% - 30% Capital expenditure Nil - 1m Nil - 3m Nil - 2m Nil - 2m Nil - 1m Discount rates 11.88% 11.88% 11.88% 11.88% 17.33% The Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital is used in UK Sports Retail, International Sports Retail, Premium Lifestyle and Brands excl.
Everlast as these CGUs are considered to have similar risk profiles.
The key assumptions are based on managements historical experience and future plans for each CGU.
A reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
All key assumptions are consistent with known external sources of information.

The permanent contribution to capital relates to a cash payment of 50,000 to the Company on 8 February 2007 under a deed of capital contribution.
The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of the Companys redeemable preference shares of 10p each at par on 2 March 2007.
The reverse combination reserve exists as a result of the adoption of the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in accounting for the Group restructuring which occurred on 2 March 2007 and 29 March 2007 between the Company and Sports World International Limited, Brands Holdings Limited, International Brand Management Limited and CDS Holdings SA with Sports World International Limited as the acquirer.
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.
The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement only when the hedged transaction impacts the income statement.

ANNUAL REPORT 2015 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 26 April 2015, the only financial instruments held at fair value were Derivative financial assets and liabilities, which are classified as Level 2, and Available-for-sale financial assets, which are classified as Level 1 except for Highland Group Holdings, which is classified as Level 3.
Highland Group Holdings is held at managements estimate of the fair value of the enterprise based on publicly available data.
A 1% increase in profitability for the company would result in a 0.3m increase in value.
The valuation of Derivative financial assets and liabilities is performed using an option valuation model, based on the market data available at the balance sheet date, depending on whether the instrument is a foreign exchange or an equity derivative.
The Group has entered into a number of put options referencing listed company shares.
To the extent that the market price of these shares is less than an agreed price on expiry of the put option, the Group has the right to elect whether to settle the put option by acquiring ordinary shares or, by paying the cash settlement value of the put option.
Sports Direct is required to transfer cash collateral to cover its obligations under the Put Option.
The amount of collateral required during the life of the Put Option can increase or decrease by reference to the underlying market price of the shares.
b DERIVATIVES: FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US Dollar.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 26 April 2015 27 April 2014 000 000 Fair value of derivative financial instruments - assets 92,199 4,355 Fair value of derivative financial instruments liabilities 5,629 18,665 83 The sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 26 April 2015 27 April 2014 000 000 US Dollar purchases 418,561 540,349 Contracted rates 1.54 1.71 1.61 1.71 At 26 April 2015 419m of forward US Dollar contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the gain on fair valuation of these contracts of 84m has therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income.
This amount is split between a profit of 77m recognised in the period and a profit of 7m reclassified in the period.
Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
At 26 April 2015 419m of purchase contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2014: 245m of purchase contracts.
c SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
The income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge.
The impact on US Dollar related hedging instruments is included in equity.
Positive figures represent an increase decrease in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 26 April 2015 27 April 2014 26 April 2015 27 April 2014 000 000 000 000 Sterling strengthens by 5% US Dollar 774 812 991 5,205 Euro 1,650 2,218 1,650 2,218 Sterling weakens by 5% US Dollar 813 852 1,041 5,465 Euro 1,732 2,329 1,732 2,329 EVERYTHING IS CHANGING... NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 26 APRIL 2015 INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The following table illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 26 April 2015 27 April 2014 26 April 2015 27 April 2014 000 000 000 000 Interest rate increase of 0.5% 690 1,690 690 1,690 Interest rate decrease of 0.5% 690 1,690 690 1,690 d LIQUIDITY RISK The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2015 Bank loans and overdrafts 1,204 135,277 5,677 - 142,158 Trade and other payables 170,090 - - - 170,090 Derivative financial liabilities Cash inflows 513,393 118,040 - - 631,433 Cash outflows 439,416 105,447 - - 544,863 97,317 122,684 5,677 - 225,678 2014 84 Bank loans and overdrafts 356,226 1,731 5,237 - 363,193 Trade and other payables 239,463 - - - 239,463 Derivative financial liabilities - - - - - Cash inflows 401,718 105,177 - - 506,895 Cash outflows 414,776 105,263 - - 520,039 608,747 1,817 5,237 - 615,800 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, compromising issued share capital, share premium and retained earnings and cash and borrowings.
It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
In respect of equity, the Board has decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
The Board is committed to keeping this policy under review and to looking to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when appropriate.
The objective of the Share Scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employees remuneration to the performance of the Company.
It is not designed as a means of managing capital.
In respect of cash and borrowings the Board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, the working capital requirements and forecasted cash flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set.
The ratio for net debt to reported underlying EBITDA, excluding charges for the Share Schemes, is 0.16 2014: 0.64.
The objective is to keep this figure below 2.5.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the Group to meet its strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
These capital management policies have remained unchanged from the prior year.
