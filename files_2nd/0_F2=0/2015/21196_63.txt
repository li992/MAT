Total net fair value gains of 39 million on owner occupied properties consist of 27 million gains 2014: 7 million gains which have been taken to other comprehensive income, 13 million reversal of losses taken to the income statement in previous years and 1 million of losses in the year 2014: 3 million losses which have been taken to the income statement.
Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers.
These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment is in accordance with UK Valuations Standards Red book, and is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably and without compulsion, on the basis of the highest and best use of asset that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Similar considerations apply to properties under construction, where an estimate is made of valuation when complete, adjusted for anticipated costs to completion, profit and risk, reflecting market conditions at the valuation date.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 361 million 2014: 329 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.
