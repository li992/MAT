Like the Falcon 900EX and 7X, it undertook this milestone test with Meggitts wheels and brakes and brake control system on board, plus Meggitts safety-critical brake temperature and tyre pressure monitoring systems.
In line with Meggitts strategy to develop core landing gear sub-systems, the scope of Meggitt work on Dassaults all-new Falcon 5X will expand still further into responsibility for safety functionsnose wheel steering, hydraulic system control and monitoring and landing gear control itself.

Its engine, Pratt & Whitneys awardwinning fuel-efficient PurePower PW1000G, is cooled by an extensive suite of Meggitt thermal management products.
Seven sub-systems feature Meggitt valves, pumps, oil coolers and heat exchangers.
The engine will power yet more innovative aircraft soon to enter servicethe Bombardier C-Series, Mitsubishi MRJ, Irkut MC21 and Embraer E2 family.
Working closely with the Groups newlylaunched Customer Services & Support organisation, Meggitt Control Systems is gearing up to support these programmes for life, which could be 40 years or more.

Exemplifying Meggitts newly-acquired advanced carbon fibre composites capability, the flow path spacer directs air into the bypass section of the engine, improving efficiency.
At just over nine kilograms, half the weight of the stainless steel original, the component is more than an advert for weight savings.
A composite rotating part has significant performance requirements that can only be met by experts in design analysis and engineering, tooling, processing and onerous qualification and testingcapabilities used to create the new Meggitt composite products in their thousands, in-service on multiple GE, Pratt & Whitney and Snecma engines.

These measurements detect nascent engine conditions and prevent catastrophic failures.
However, as core health monitoring tools, our sensors also boost day-to-day operating economics.
Maintenance can be planned cost-effectively based on component condition, maximising product life on wing.
And fuel burn deterioration rates can be extrapolated.
This enables airlines to rotate aircraft around their networks, ensuring newly refurbished engines that consume less fuel are scheduled for routes where efficiency really counts.

Known for the unsettling realism of combat scenarios in far-flung territories, it also creates virtual worlds nearer home, simulating the live-fire ranges of specific US military bases.
There are economic and environmental imperatives.
Ammunition is expensive and polluting.
After using a Meggitt virtual training system, soldiers progress to live-fire ranges, qualifying faster, using fewer bullets.
Our newest small arms trainer is the system-of-record for the US Army, US Marine Corps and the defence ministries of the UK, Canada and Australia.
