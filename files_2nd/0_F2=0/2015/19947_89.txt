Accounting policies Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to thelessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
