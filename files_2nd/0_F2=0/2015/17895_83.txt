Deferred tax A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The most significant recognised deferred tax assets relate to the deficits on the Groups pension retirement schemes see below.
This is because retirement benefit costs are deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by employees, but deducted in determining taxable profit either when contributions are paid to the pension retirement schemes or when retirement benets are paid.
In reviewing the probability that taxable profits will be available in the future against which such contributions payments can be deducted, account has been taken of the deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes which run until 2026.
In other words, these temporary differences are largely expected to reverse over the next ten years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Future changes in tax rates Under the Finance Act 2013, the UK current tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
2 Act 2015, the UK current tax rate will reduce to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce future UK current tax charges accordingly.
The reduction to 18% was substantively enacted before 31 December 2015.
In line with this change, the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has been reduced from 20% to 18%, creating a rate adjustment in 2015, which is partly reected in the Consolidated income statement and partly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2015 have been calculated at 18%.
