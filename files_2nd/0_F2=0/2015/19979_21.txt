Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 Financial statements 76 Notes to the Group financial statements 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 1 Performance in the period 1.1 Accounting policies Revenue recognition Sale of goods instore and online, and fuel Revenue from the sale of goods in-store and online comprises cash from customers and excludes VAT.
It is net of returns, colleague discounts, coupons, vouchers, Match & More points earned in-store and online and the free element of multi-save transactions.
Sale of fuel is recognised net of VAT and Match & More points earned on fuel.
Revenue is recognised when transactions are completed in-store, or, in the case of food online, when goods are accepted by the customer on delivery.
Other sales Other revenue includes income from concessions and commissions based on the terms of the contract, and manufacturing sales made direct to third party customers recognised on despatch of goods.
Revenue collected on behalf of others is not recognised as revenue, other than the related commission.
Sales are recorded net of VAT and intra-group transactions.
Match & More and other initiatives The fair value of Match & More and other initiatives is determined to be the value to the customer of the points issued, adjusted for factors such as the expected redemption rate.
Given Match & More was launched in the year the Group will continue to assess the appropriateness of the rates against actual redemptions going forward.
The fair value is treated as a deduction from revenue at the time the points are issued, and is deferred until the rewards are redeemed by the customer in a future sale.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of all costs of the goods being sold to the point of sale, net of promotional funding and commercial income, and includes property, manufacturing, warehouse and transportation costs.
Store depreciation, store overheads and store-based employee costs are also allocated to cost of sales.
Promotional funding Promotional funding refers to investment in the customer offer by suppliers by way of promotion.
The calculation of funding is mechanical and system generated based on a funding level agreed in advance with the supplier.
Funding is recognised as units are sold and invoiced in accordance with the specic supplier agreement.
Funding is recorded effectively as a direct adjustment to the cost price of the product in the period.
Funding is invoiced and collected through the year, shortly after the promotions have ended.
Commercial income Commercial income is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.
The Group only recognises commercial income where there is documented evidence of an agreement with an individual supplier.
The types of commercial income recognised by the Group, and the recognition policies are: Type of commercial income Description Recognition Marketing and Examples include income in respect Income is recognised over the period as set out in the specic supplier agreement.
advertising funding of in-store marketing and point of Income is invoiced once the performance conditions in the supplier agreement sale, as well as funding for advertising have been achieved.
Volume-based Income earned by achieving Income is recognised through the year based on forecasts for expected sales or rebates volume or spend targets set by the purchase volumes, informed by current performance, trends, and the terms of the supplier for specic products over supplier agreement.
Income is invoiced throughout the year in accordance with the specic periods specic supplier terms.
In order to minimise any risk arising from estimation, supplier conrmations are also obtained to agree the final value to be recognised at year end, prior to it being invoiced.
Uncollected commercial income at the balance sheet date is classied within the financial statements as follows: Creditors: A large proportion of the Groups trading terms state that income due from suppliers will be netted against amounts owing to that supplier.
Any outstanding invoiced commercial income relating to these suppliers at the balance sheet date will be included within trade payables.
Debtors: Where the trading terms described above do not exist, the Group classies outstanding commercial income within trade debtors.
Where commercial income is earned and not invoiced to the supplier at the balance sheet date, this is classied within accrued commercial income.
Stock: The carrying value of stock is adjusted to reect unearned elements of commercial income as the stock has not yet been sold.
This income is subsequently recognised in cost of sales when the product has been sold.
In order to provide users of the accounts with greater understanding in this area additional income statement and balance sheet disclosure is provided in notes 1.6, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 to the financial statements.

profit loss on disposal and exit of properties profit loss from the disposal and exit of properties includes gains and losses on disposal of property assets and other costs incurred by the Group following a decision to dispose, close or no longer purchase properties.
Where the Group disposes of a property, this disposal transaction is accounted for upon unconditional exchange of contracts.
Gains and losses are determined by comparing sale proceeds with the assets carrying amount and are presented net of costs associated with disposal.

The Group is not reliant on any major customer for 1% or more ofrevenues.
The Group is required to determine and present its operating segments based on the way in which financial information is organised and reported to the chief operating decision-maker CODM.
The CODM has been identied as the Management Board as it is this Board that makes the key operating decisions of the Group, is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance.
Key internal reports received by the CODM, primarily the management accounts, focus on the performance of the Group as a whole.
The operations of all elements of the business are driven by the retail sales environment and hence have fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
All operational decisions made are focused on the performance and growth of the retail outlets and the ability of the business to meet the supply demands of the stores.
The Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 as well as its internal reporting framework, management and operating structure.
Inparticular, the Group considered its retail outlets, the fuel resale operation, the manufacturing entities and multi-channel operations.
The Directors conclusion is that the Group has one operating segment, that of retailing.
Reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, profit orloss, assets and liabilities and other material items Performance is measured by the CODM based on underlying profit before tax as reported in the management accounts.
Management believes that this underlying profit measure is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the Group to its peers.
This information and the reconciliation to the statutory position can be found in note 1.4.
In addition, the management accounts present a Group balance sheet containing assets and liabilities.
Thisbalance sheet is as shown within theConsolidated balance sheet.

1.5 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earningsattributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two 2014: two classes of instrument that are potentially dilutive: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period and contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plans LTIP.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 83 2 Taxation The focus of the Groups approach to tax affairs is to ensure compliance with the relevant laws of the territories in which the Group operates.
Almostallof the Groups stores and sales are in the UK, therefore the majority of taxes are paid in the UK.
The Group takes a compliance-focused approach to its tax affairs, and has a transparent relationship with the UK and overseas tax authorities andinteracts with HMRC on a regular basis.
The Groups tax policy provides a governance framework with all related risks and stakeholder interests taken into consideration.
The tax policy is approved by the Board, with updates on tax compliance and governance matters being provided to the Audit Committee.
The Group operates a small number of branches and subsidiary companies outside of the UK based in the following overseas jurisdictions: The Netherlands: The Group has manufacturing operations in the Netherlands as part of its produce supply chain.
Local corporation taxes of 1.9m were paid during 2015 2014: 2.2m : Hong Kong: Offices in Hong Kong were established in 2011 and source many of the Groups non-food products.
Local corporation taxes of 0.4m were paid during 2015 2014: 0.3m : and Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey: The Groups insurance company is based in the Isle of Man for regulatory reasons, and property assets with a net book value of 44m are held in Jersey and Guernsey as a result of historic acquisitions.
All profits in each of these jurisdictions are subject to UK tax.
2.1 Accounting policies Current tax The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws in effect during the period and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Taxable profit differs from the reported profit for the period as it is adjusted both for items that will never be taxable or deductible, and temporary differences.
Current tax is charged to profit or loss for the period, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly in other comprehensive income or equity in which case the current tax is reected in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method.
Provision is made for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
No deferred tax is recognised for temporary differences that arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that are not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits.
Deferred tax is calculated based on tax law that is enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and provided at rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit for the period except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is reected in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets recognised are reviewed at each reporting date as judgement is required to estimate the availability of future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where amounts will be settled on a net basis as there is a legally enforceable right to offset.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates of the probable outcome of tax compliance issues.
All accruals are included in current liabilities.

3 Tax reconciliation The reconciliation below shows how the tax credit of 31m has arisen on loss before tax of 792m.
The tax for the period is higher 2014: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 21.3% 2014: 23.2%.
The differences are explainedbelow: 2015 2014 m m Loss before taxation 792 176 Loss before taxation at 21.3% 2014: 23.2% 169 41 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 3 4 Disallowed depreciation on UK properties 28 35 Deferred tax on Safeway acquisition assets 22 5 profit on property transactions 4 1 Impairment and onerous lease provisions not deductible for tax 240 154 Effect of change in tax rate 68 Other 3 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 107 15 Tax credit charge for the period 31 62 Factors affecting current and future tax charges The Groups tax charge has reduced from the prior year.
The reduction in the current tax charge reects the lower underlying profit, whilst elements of the asset impairments announced by the Group are also deductible for tax purposes.
The Group also benefited from adjustments in respect of prior periods for which the liability has now been settled with HMRC.
The Groups deferred tax liabilities have also reduced year on year, primarily as a result of impairments reducing the carrying value of property assets for which the Group provides for deferred tax.
Legislation to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 20% was included in the Finance Act 2013.
The 20% rate will apply from April 2015.
Deferred tax isalready provided at 20%.
There has not been any indication of any further changes in the rate of corporation tax from 20%.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that will benefit from the synergies of the business combination forthe purpose of impairment testing.
Brands Brands acquired through a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date and amortised to profit or loss ona straightline basis over their estimated useful economic life.
During the year the Group disposed of 15m of fully written down brands relating to Kiddicare.
Software development costs Costs that are directly attributable to the creation of identiable software, which meet the development asset recognition criteria as laidout in IAS 38 Intangible assets are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs include consultancy costs, the employment costs of internal software developers and borrowing costs.
All other software development and maintenance costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Software development assets are held at historic cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and are amortised over theirestimated useful lives 3 to 10 years on a straight-line basis.
Licences Separately acquired pharmaceutical licences and software licences are recognised at historic cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Those acquired in a business combination are recognised atfair value at the acquisition date.
Pharmaceutical licences and softwarelicences are amortised over their useful lives 3 to 10 years onastraight-line basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include directly attributablecosts such as borrowing costs and employment costs of those people directly working on the construction and installation of property, plant and equipment.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 Financial statements 86 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 3 Operating assets continued 3.1 Accounting policies continued Depreciation rates Depreciation rates used to write off cost less residual value on a straight-line basis are: Freehold land 0% Freehold buildings 2.5% Leasehold land Over the lease period Leasehold buildings Over the shorter of lease periodand 2.5% Plant, equipment, xtures andvehicles 10% to 33% Assets under construction 0% Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with animmaterial amount in administration expenses.
Investment property Property held to earn rental income is classied as investment property and is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Thedepreciation policy is consistent with that described for property above.
Noncurrent assets classied as heldforsale Non-current assets are classied as held-for-sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather than continuing use within the Group, and the sale is considered highly probable.
The sale is expected to complete within one year fromthe date of classication and the assets are available for sale intheir current condition.
Non-current assets held-for-sale are stated at thelower of carrying amountand fair value less costs to dispose and are not depreciated.
Lessor accounting operating leases Assets acquired and made available to third parties under operating leases are recorded as property, plant and equipment or investment property and are depreciated on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Operating lease income is credited onastraight-line basis to the date of the next rent review.
Finance leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic life or lease term, whichever is shorter.
The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value and the present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the future minimum lease payments.
The obligations to pay future rentals are included within liabilities.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of finance charge on the remaining balance.
Impairment of nonnancial assets Intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as goodwill, and those in construction that are not yet being amortised, are tested for impairment annually.
Other non-financial assets are tested if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Testing is performed at the level of a cash generating unit CGU in order to compare the CGUs recoverable amount against its carrying value.
Animpaired CGU is written down to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use or its fair value less costs to dispose.
In assessing valuein use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
The Group considers that each of its stores is a CGU, which together form a grocery group of CGUs supported by corporate assets such as head office and vertically integrated suppliers.
Impairment losses are reversed if there is evidence of an increase in the recoverable amount of a previously impaired asset, but only to the extent that the recoverable amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.
Any reversal of impairment losses would be excluded from underlying earnings.

Goodwill The goodwill arose on the acquisition of Flower World Limited 3m and Farmers Boy Deeside Limited 7m.
Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill of 10m is allocated to the grocery group of CGUs.
This group of CGUs has been tested for impairment via the value in use calculation described in note 3.3.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 89 3 Operating assets continued 3.3 Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment The Group considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Group calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised based on the following methodology: Value in use is calculated by projecting individual store pre-tax cash ows over the remaining useful life of the store, based on forecasting assumptions.
The methodology used for calculating future cash ows is to: use the actual cash ows for each store in the current year: allocate a proportion of the Groups central costs to each store on an appropriate basis: project each stores cash ows over the next five years by applying forecast sales and cost growth assumptions: project cash ows beyond year five for the remaining useful life of each store by applying a long term growth rate: and discount the cash ows using a pre-tax rate of 9.0% 2014: 6.5%.
The discount rate takes into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Fair value less costs of disposal is estimated by the Directors based on their knowledge of individual stores and the markets they serve and likely demand from grocers or other retailers.
The Directors also obtain valuations by store prepared by independent valuers and consider these in carrying out their estimate of fair value less cost of disposal for the purposes of testing for impairment.
In determining their valuation, the independent valuers assume an expected rent and yield for each store based on the quality of the asset, local catchment and the store being occupied by a supermarket tenant with a similar covenant to Morrisons.
In order to reect recent changes in market conditions, in particular the very significant decrease in demand from major grocery retailers for supermarket space, the Directors consider it appropriate for the purpose of testing for impairment to revise downwards the rent and yield assumptions in the independent valuation to reect the following factors on a store by store basis: Whether a major grocery operator might buy the store, taking into consideration whether they are already located near the store, and whether the store size is appropriate for their business model, and then if not: Assessing whether a smaller store operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store, and then if not: Assessing whether a non-food operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store.
Having applied the above methodology and assumptions, the Group has recognised an impairment charge of 1,116m tangible assets: 1,113m and intangible assets: 3m during the year 2014: 459m.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate would result in an additional impairment charge of 70m.

Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classied as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements anddetermined them to be joint ventures.
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
Investments Investments comprise investments in equity instruments held for long term investment.
They are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, where the fair value can be measured reliably.
Where the fair value of the instruments cannot be measured reliably, for example, when there isvariability in the range of estimates, the investments are recognised at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Business combinations The acquisition method is used to account for business combinations.
Consideration is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, including the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, aremeasured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees netassets.
Goodwill is the excess of consideration transferred, plus any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the identiable net assets acquired.
In the event that this excess is negative the difference is recognised directly in profit for theperiod.
Disposal of subsidiaries When the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control islost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassied to profit or loss.
4.2 Principal subsidiaries The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under section 410 2 of Companies Act 2006 by providing information only in relation to subsidiary undertakings whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affect the financial statements.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2014 15 97 6 Capital and borrowings 6.1 Accounting policies Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, any difference between the redemption value and the initial carrying amount is recognised in profit for the period over the period of the borrowings on aneffective interest rate basis.
Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the Groups profit for the period on an effective interest rate basis except for interest costs that are directly attributable to the construction of buildings and other qualifying assets, which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of the asset.
Capitalisation commences when both expenditure on the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred, and necessary activities to prepare the asset for use are in progress.
In the case of new stores, this is generally once planning permission has been obtained.
Capitalisation ceases when the asset is ready for use.
Interest is capitalised at the effective rate incurred on borrowings before taxation of 5% 2014: 5%.
Capitalised interest is included within interest paid in cash ow from operating activities.
Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases: all other leases are classied as finance leases.
Property leases are analysed into separate components for land and buildings and tested to establish whether the components are operating leases or finance leases.
Rental payments on operating leases in which the Group is lessee are taken to profit for the period on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Sale and leaseback of properties The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends upon the substance of the transaction by applying the lease classication principles described above.
For sale and operating leasebacks, the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Statement of comprehensive income.
A number of new property operating leases have been entered into in the year ended 1February 2015 see property commitments note 6.8.
When forming the conclusion of operating lease classication, consideration was given to the key lease classication indicators of IAS 17.
The leases are typically for a 25 year period.
The Directors have reviewed the remaining useful lives for these particular properties and concluded they are signicantly longer than the period of the lease.
As disclosed on page 88 a review of the useful economic lives of each of the property, plant and equipment categories has been performed in the year with no changes made.
Other key indicators considered in reaching an operating lease classication were the present value of the minimum lease payments and the ownership clauses in the contracts upon expiry of the lease.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity asadeduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled.
On cancellation, the nominal valueof the shares is deducted from share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
Own shares held The Group has employee trusts for the granting of Group shares toexecutives and members of the employee share plans.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trusts are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from retained earnings.

In September 2014 the Group entered into a new five year syndicated committed revolving credit facility of 1.35bn, replacing the 1.2bn facility that was due to mature in March 2016.
The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates and drawdowns bear interest at a spread above LIBOR.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, the principal amounts and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has 1,180m 2014: 775m of undrawn, oating, committed borrowing facilities available in respect of which all conditions present had been met.
Maturity of borrowings The table below summarises the maturity prole of the Groups borrowings based on contractual, undiscounted payments, which include interest payments.
As a result, amounts shown below do not agree to the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet for borrowings.

The fair value of the USPP is estimated by comparing the interest rate to market rates available to the Group at the balance sheet date level 2.
The fair values of borrowings included in level 2 are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debts on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

6.7 Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity and net debt balances, as well as its lease commitments.
The Groups capital management objectives are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern providing returns to shareholders via optimising debt and equity balances, maintaining an investment grade credit rating and having adequate liquidity headroom.
The Group manages its capital structure by issuing new debt or shares.
During the current financial year, net debt has reduced by 477m, reecting strong operating cash ow, reduced capital expenditure and 448m of property disposals.
Additional funding of 300m has been obtained through the Groups bond programme, whilst the Groups syndicated revolving credit facility has been renewed and extended to 1.35bn.
The overall impact of this additional funding has been an increase in the average maturity period of the Groups debt.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with the gearing and xed charge cover covenants attaching to its revolving credit facility, and the USPP.

8 Pensions 8.1 Accounting policies A dened contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays xed contributions into a separate entity and provides no guarantee as to the quantum of retirement benets that those contributions will ultimately purchase.
A dened benefit scheme is one that is not a dened contribution scheme.
Dened benefit schemes Pension scheme assets are valued at market rates.
Pension scheme obligations are an estimate of the amount required to pay the benets that employees have earned in exchange for current and past service, assessed and discounted to present value using the assumptions shown in note 8.4.
The net pension liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet is the net of the schemes assets and obligations, which are calculated separately for each scheme.
The Group has a right to recognise the net pension asset in the Retirement saver plan RSP.
Current service cost is treated as an operating cost in the Consolidated statement of income and Statement of cash ows and is part of underlying earnings.
Netinterest income expense is calculated by applying the discount rate on liabilities to the net pension liability or asset adjusted for cash ows over the accounting period and is recognised in finance income costs and excluded from underlying earnings.
Expenses incurred in respect of the management of scheme assets are included in Other comprehensive income as a reduction in the return on scheme assets.
Other scheme expenses are recognised in profit or loss as an operating expense.
Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses on the obligations and the return on scheme assets excluding interest.
They are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income.
Amounts shown within section 8 are before any adjustments for deferredtaxation.
8.2 Dened benefit schemes: summary and description The Group operates three dened benefit retirement schemes together the Schemes providing benets based on a benefit formula that depends on factors including the employees age and number of years of service.
The Morrison and Safeway Schemes provide pension benets based on either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE the CARE Schemes.
The CARE Schemes are generally not open to new members.
The RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a dened proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with ination.
The position of each scheme at 1 February 2015 is as follows: 2015 2014 Net position liability asset: m m CARE schemes 43 13 RSP 4 2 Combined net position 39 11 At the year end, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within assets on the balance sheet and schemes in deficit have been disclosed within liabilities.
In the prior year a net position was disclosed within liabilities since the surplus was considered immaterial.

The Board of each Scheme is required by law to act in the best interest of the Scheme participants and is responsible for setting the investment, funding and governance policies of the fund.
A representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings in order to provide the Groups view on investment strategy, but the ultimate power lies with the Trustees.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Scheme gives the Trustees the power to set contributions.
In the Safeway Scheme and the RSP this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The latest full actuarial valuations have been carried out as at 1 April 2013 for the Safeway Scheme and 5 April 2013 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The results of these valuations for the CARE Schemes have been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benets purposes for the period to 1 February 2015 by a qualied independent actuary.
For the RSP, an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS 19, based on member data as at 1 February 2015, has been completed by an independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Group to ination risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Schemes expose the Group to longevity risk.
8.3 Scheme assets Assets of the Schemes generate returns and ultimately cash that is used to satisfy the Schemes obligations.
They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and in different allocations amongst those assets, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Schemes is to maintain a balance of approximately 40% equities and 60% bond-like investments.
RSPinvestments are currently based primarily in equities.
There are no direct investments in the parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

This is achieved through the use of liability driven investments LDI, whose main goal is to have sufficient assets to meet all current and future liabilities as they fall due.
LDI involves the use of derivatives such as swaps and other investment instruments.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.

The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis, although the agreements do not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held bythe CARE Schemes do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The profits shared with the Schemes are reected in the Group financial statements as pension contributions.
The SLP made a cash contribution of 6.6m during the year ending 1 February 2015, and will make annual contributions of 6.6m for a further 18 years.

In practice any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the netasset liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.

The Morrison Scheme is entirely funded by theparent Company and the Safeway Scheme is funded by Safeway Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Groups subsidiaries participate in the RSP.
There isnocontractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net dened benefit cost between the parent Company and its subsidiaries.
Thecontribution ofeach participating subsidiary to the RSP is calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The current best estimate of Group contributions to be paid for the accounting period commencing 2 February 2015 is 92m.
This estimate includes amounts payable from the SLP and salary sacrificed contributions from employees.
8.6 Proposed closure of CARE schemes to future accrual During January 2015, the Group reached an agreement in principle with the Trustees of the CARE Schemes to close them to future accrual, subject to the outcome of consultation with current scheme members.
The Groups proposal is that scheme members accrued benets will be frozen subject to inationary revaluation, and that future benets will no longer accrue in these schemes.
Following this agreement the Group has entered into a consultation with scheme members on 23 February 2015.
The Group expects that the consultation process will conclude during May 2015.
Subject to the outcome of the consultation, any changes would become effective in early July 2015.
The financial effect of closing these schemes to future accrual would be to reduce the Groups exposure to future volatility, and increases in pension liabilities and costs.
9 Sharebased payments 9.1 Accounting policy Sharebased payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value of the sharebased award is calculated at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
This is based on the Groups estimate of share options that will eventually vest.
This takes into account movement of non-market conditions, being service conditions and financial performance, if relevant.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of a binomial stochastic model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The charge in the period for share-based payments was 11m 2014: 6m.
9.2 Share save schemes The Share save scheme began in May 2000 and all employees including Executive Directors are eligible once the necessary service requirements have been met.
The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a xed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the xed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is subject only to service conditions.
The schemes that launched in May2011 and subsequently are under the new scheme rules approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
The fair value of options granted, and the inputs used to determine it are as follows: Grant date 20 May 2014 13 May 2013 14 May 2012 17 May 2011 Share price at grant date 2.10 2.92 2.79 3.01 Fair value of options granted 11.6m 8.1m 9.1m 11.5m Exercise price 1.64 2.25 2.36 2.28 Dividend yield 6.21% 4.17% 3.69% 3.2% Annual risk free interest rate 1.00% 0.45% 0.53% 1.65% Expected volatility 18.3% 16.8% 19.4% 24.2% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date ofgrant.

This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The discount is determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.
