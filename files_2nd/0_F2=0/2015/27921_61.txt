The Group has also revised its calculation of the credit conversion factors in respect of pipeline assets used in both leverage and capital ratios to more closely correspond with CRD IV guidance.
Corresponding figures have been adjusted for consistency, although the recalculated ratios differ from those already reported by insignificant amounts.
The regulatory capital disclosures in these financial statements relate only to the consolidated position for the Group.
Individual entities within the Group are also subject to supervision on a standalone basis.
All such entities complied with the requirements to which they were subject during the year.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The principal financial risks arising from the Groups normal business activities are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Board of Directors has a Risk and Compliance Committee, established in 2014, consisting of the Chairman and the non-executive directors which is responsible for risk management.
The Credit Committee and the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO are executive sub-committees of the Risk and Compliance Committee which review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
The Corporate Governance Statement in Section B3 provides further detail on the operations of these committees.
The financial risk management policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end.
The position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
Paragon Bank has its own risk management structure which is overseen by the Group committees.
Use of derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Such instruments are contracts with counterparties and are used only to reduce or eliminate the exposure of the Group to movements in market interest or exchange rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, and hence all of the Groups derivative financial instruments are for commercial hedging purposes only.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures principally arising from fixed rate lending or borrowing and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Hedge accounting is applied where appropriate, though it should be noted that some derivatives, while forming part of an economic hedge relationship, do not qualify for this accounting treatment under the IAS 39 rules, while in other cases hedge accounting has not been adopted either because natural accounting offsets are expected or because complying with the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules would be particularly onerous.
The Group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
In particular this treatment is used for: a hedging the interest rate risk of groups of fixed rate prepayable loan assets with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis b hedging the interest rate risk of groups of fixed rate retail deposits with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis In both cases the Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with the economic hedging approach taken by the Group to these assets and liabilities.
The Group has also designated cash flow hedging relationships, principally arising from currency borrowings, where a specified foreign exchange basis swap, set up as part of the terms of the borrowing is used.
The Company has no derivative assets or liabilities.
PAGE 164 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS Credit risk The Groups business objectives rely on maintaining a high-quality customer base and place strong emphasis on good credit management, both at the time of acquiring or underwriting a new loan, where strict lending criteria are applied, and throughout the loans life.
Primary responsibility for credit risk management across the Group lies with the Credit Committee.
The Credit Committee is made up of four senior employees, drawn from financial and risk functions independent of the underwriting process.
It is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
Its key responsibilities include setting and reviewing credit policy, controlling applicant quality, tracking account performance against targets, agreeing product criteria and lending guidelines and monitoring performance and trends.
In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments, short-term investments and cash deposits, ALCO determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, based on risk appetite parameters agreed by the Board.
It then establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
The assets of the Group and the Company which are subject to credit risk are set out below: The Group The Company Note 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Loans to customers 31 10,062.4 9,255.9 - - 34 Investments in structured entities 18.1 19.3 - - 35 Derivative financial assets 660.1 693.9 - - 36 Amounts owed by Group companies - - 141.2 103.9 36 Accrued interest income 0.4 0.3 0.1 - CSA assets 36 0.9 - - - 37 Short term investments 41.1 39.4 - - 38 Cash 1,056.0 848.8 196.8 166.5 Maximum exposure to credit risk 11,839.0 10,857.6 338.1 270.4 While this maximum exposure represents the potential loss which might have to be accounted for by the Group, the terms on which the Groups loan assets are funded, described under Liquidity Risk below, limit the amount of principal repayments on the Groups securitised and warehouse borrowings in cases of capital losses on assets, significantly reducing the effective shareholder value at risk.
Loans to customers and other investments in loan assets The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its loans to customers.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual counterparties due to the large number of customers included in the portfolios.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 165 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS The Groups loan assets at 30 September 2015 are analysed as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 m % m % Buy-to-let mortgages 9,363.2 93.0% 8,592.1 92.8% Owner occupied mortgages 47.6 0.5% 59.6 0.7% Total first mortgages 9,410.8 93.5% 8,651.7 93.5% Secured loans 387.1 3.9% 436.2 4.7% Loans secured on property 9,797.9 97.4% 9,087.9 98.2% Car loans 43.4 0.4% 5.7 0.1% Retail finance loans 0.2 - 0.4 - Other loans 220.9 2.2% 161.9 1.7% Total loans to customers 10,062.4 100.0% 9,255.9 100.0% Other loans include unsecured loans either advanced by Group companies or acquired from their originators at a discount.
The Groups underwriting philosophy is based on a combination of sophisticated individual credit assessment and the automated efficiencies of a scored decision making process.
Information on each applicant is combined with data taken from a credit reference bureau to provide a complete credit picture of the applicant and the borrowing requested.
Key information is validated through a combination of documentation and statistical data which collectively provides evidence of the applicants ability and willingness to pay the amount contracted under the loan agreement.
First mortgages and secured loans are secured by charges over residential properties in England and Wales, or similar Scottish or Northern Irish securities.
Car loans are effectively secured by the financed vehicle.
Despite this security, in assessing credit risk, an applicants ability and propensity to repay the loan remain the principal factors in the decision to lend.
In considering whether to acquire pools of loan assets or invest in loan portfolios, the Group will undertake a due diligence exercise on the underlying loan accounts.
Such assets are generally not fully performing and are offered at a discount to their current balance.
The Groups procedures may include inspection of original loan documents, verification of security and the examination of the credit status of borrowers.
Current and historic cash flow data will also be examined.
The objective of the exercise is to establish, to a level of confidence similar to that provided by the underwriting process, that the assets will generate sufficient cash flows to recover the Groups investment and generate an appropriate return without exposing the Group to material operational or conduct risks.
PAGE 166 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS An analysis of the indexed loan to value ratio LTV for those loan accounts secured on property by value at 30 September 2015 is set out below.
For acquired accounts the effect of any discount on purchase is allowed for.
The number of accounts in arrears by asset class, based on the most commonly quoted definition of arrears for the type of asset, at 30 September 2015 and 30 September 2014, compared to the industry averages at those dates published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders CML and the Finance and Leasing Association FLA, was: 2015 2014 % % First mortgages Accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 0.19 0.25 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.04 0.04 Owner Occupied accounts 3.55 3.94 CML data for mortgage accounts more than three months in arrears Buy-to-Let accounts including receiver of rent cases 0.67 0.85 Buy-to-Let accounts excluding receiver of rent cases 0.61 0.74 Owner Occupied accounts 1.27 1.50 All mortgages 1.17 1.39 Secured loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 19.56 19.84 FLA data for secured loans 15.80 17.20 Car loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 0.67 7.85 FLA data for all personal loans 3.00 4.60 Other loans Accounts more than 2 months in arrears 94.66 87.50 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 167 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS No published industry data for asset classes comparable to the Groups other books has been identified.
Where revised data at 30 September 2014 has been published by the FLA or CML, the comparative industry figures above have been amended.
The Group calculates its headline arrears measure for buy-to-let mortgages, shown above, based on the numbers of accounts three months or more in arrears, including purchased Idem Capital assets, but excluding those cases in possession and receiver of rent cases designated for sale.
This is consistent with the methodology used by the CML in compiling its statistics for the buy-to-let mortgage market as a whole.
The number of accounts in arrears will be higher for closed books such as the owner occupied mortgage book and the retail finance and unsecured loan books than for comparable active ones, as performing accounts pay off their balances, leaving arrears accounts representing a greater proportion of the total.
The improvement in the arrears position for car loans shown above is due to the recommencement of lending in this market, through Paragon Bank, with the new performing cases reducing the overall average.
The figures shown above for secured loans and other loans include purchased portfolios which generally include a high proportion of cases in arrears at the time of purchase and where this level of performance is allowed for in the discount to current balance represented by the purchase price.
The payment status of the carrying balances of the Groups live loan assets, before provision for impairment, at 30 September 2015 and at 30 September 2014 split between those accounts considered as performing and those included in the population for impairment testing, is shown below.

Where assets have been purchased by the Idem Capital loan investment business, customers may already have been in arrears at the time of acquisition and an appropriate adjustment made to the consideration paid.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 169 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS Investments in structured entities represent the Groups contribution made to special purpose vehicle SPV companies established and controlled by third parties to purchase pools of loan assets.
All such investments are denominated in sterling and the underlying loans are made to UK borrowers.
Cash generated by the assets is distributed to investors in accordance with a specified priority of payments.
The Group has no obligation to make further contributions to the SPV companies concerned.
The management has considered the position of the underlying assets and concluded that they will generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amount of the investment.
In the debt purchase industry, Estimated Remaining Collections ERC is commonly used as a measure of the value of a portfolio.
This is defined as the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be received over a specified future period.
In the Groups view, this measure may be suitable for heavily discounted, unsecured, distressed portfolios, but is less applicable for the types of portfolio in which the Group has invested, where cash flows are higher on acquisition, loans may be secured on property and customers may not be in default.
In such cases, the IAS 39 amortised cost balance, at which these assets are carried in the Group balance sheet, provides a better indication of value.
However, to aid comparability the 84 and 120 month ERC values for the Groups purchased assets included in the Idem Capital division, are set out below, analysed by the balance sheet line on which they appear.
These are derived using the same models and assumptions used in the EIR calculations, but the differing bases of calculation lead to different outcomes.

Derivative financial assets In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments and cash deposits, ALCO determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
Such counterparties are typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the Groups securitisation structures, must comply with criteria set out in the financing arrangements, which are monitored externally.
Where a derivative counterparty fails to meet the required criteria they are obliged under the terms of the instruments to set aside a cash collateral deposit.
The amounts of these cash collateral deposits, which do not form part of the Groups cash position, are given in note 35.
PAGE 170 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of the counterparties to its derivative financial assets, analysed by their long term credit rating as determined by Fitch is set out below.
2015 2014 m m Carrying value of derivative financial assets Counterparties rated AA- 91.9 193.5 A 6.2 4.2 A 515.1 496.2 BBB 46.9 - Gross exposure 660.1 693.9 Collateral amounts posted 753.5 87.3 Net exposure 93.4 606.6 Short term investments The Groups short term investments are held within Paragon Bank and form part of the liquidity buffer it is required to hold by the PRA.
These investments may only be placed in treasury bills and gilts issued by the UK government, or such similar instruments as are permitted by the regulator, and as such the credit risk is judged to be minimal.
Cash and cash equivalents The Groups cash balances are held in sterling at the Bank of England and at highly rated banks in current accounts and as short fixed term deposits and money market placements.
The Group has a large exposures policy to mitigate any concentration risk in respect of its cash deposits.
Credit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be minimal.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might be unable to satisfy any payment which is required to be made out of cash available to it at the time.
The Group manages the liquidity requirements of its lending operations in two ways.
Within the Paragon Mortgages and Idem Capital divisions, securitisation is used to mitigate its exposure to liquidity risk on its borrowings, ensuring, as far as possible, that the maturities of assets and liabilities are matched Within Paragon Bank, which is funded by the acceptance of retail deposits, liquidity is subject to regulation by the PRA.
This regulation aims to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are held to mitigate the liquidity risk inherent in deposit taking.
The Bank also seeks to manage the maturities of the deposits it accepts and the likely terms of the loans it offers to reduce liquidity risk The Groups originated loan assets, outside Paragon Bank, are principally financed by asset backed loan notes Notes issued through the securitisation process.
In a securitisation an SPV company within the Group will issue Notes secured on a pool of mortgage or other loan assets owned by the SPV in a public offer.
The Notes have a maturity date later than the final repayment date for any asset in the pool, typically over thirty years from the issue date.
The noteholders are entitled to receive repayment of the Note principal from principal funds generated by the loan assets from time to time, but their right to the repayment of principal is limited to the cash available in the SPV.
Similarly, payment of accrued interest to the noteholders is limited to cash generated within the SPV.
There is no requirement for any Group company other than the issuing SPV to make principal or interest payments in respect of the Notes.
This matching of the maturities of the assets and the related funding substantially reduces the Groups exposure to liquidity risk.
Details of Notes in issue are given in note 50 and the assets backing the Notes are shown in notes 29 and 30.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 171 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS During the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group extended securitisation funding to certain of the purchased assets generated through its Idem Capital business.
Although privately funded, these SPVs have similar liquidity risk characteristics to the public issues described above.
In each case the Group provides funding to the SPV at inception, subordinated to the Notes, which means that the primary credit risk on the pool assets is retained within the Group.
The Group receives the residual income generated by the assets.
These factors mean that the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets remain with the Group, and hence the loans remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Cash received from time to time in each SPV is held until the next interest payment date when, following payment of principal, interest and the associated costs of the SPV, the remaining balances become available to the Group.
Cash balances are also held within each SPV to provide credit enhancement for the particular securitisation, allowing interest and principal payments to be made even if some of the loans default.
In order to provide further credit enhancement in certain of the SPVs, specific economic trigger events exist which cause additional cash to be retained in the SPV rather than being transferred to the Group.
While the Group can, if it chooses, contribute additional cash to cover these requirements, it is under no obligation to do so.
No such events occurred in the year ended 30 September 2015 or the year ended 30 September 2014.
Whether any such events in any of the Groups other SPVs arise in the future will depend on the performance of the general economy and its impact on mortgage and loan arrears in each SPV.
However if all of the remaining trigger events occurred, a total of 90.8m of additional cash would be retained in the SPV companies 2014: 77.7m.
The cash balances of the SPV companies are included within the restricted cash balances disclosed in note 38 as securitisation cash.
Newly originated mortgage loans are initially funded by a revolving loan facility or warehouse from the point of their origination until their inclusion in a securitisation transaction.
A warehouse company functions in a similar way to an SPV, except that funds are drawn down as advances are made, repaid when loans are securitised and may subsequently be redrawn.
On 29 February 2008 the warehouse facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited ceased to be available for new drawings and new mortgage lending ceased, although the secured assets held within it at that time continued to be funded.
Repayment of the principal on this warehouse facility is not required unless amounts are realised from the underlying secured assets.
The final repayment date of the facility is later than the final due date of the secured assets it funds.
Mortgage loans advanced since the recommencement of lending in 2010 have been funded through one of four warehouse facilities, which are detailed in note 50.
Each warehouse facility is agreed with an individual bank and is available for drawing and redrawing for a set commitment period, although each has the option to be renewed before the period ends.
After the end of the commitment period the funding will remain in place for a further period until the underlying assets can be sold or refinanced.
Repayment of the principal amount of the facilities is not required unless amounts are realised from the secured assets either through repayment, securitisation or asset sales, even after the end of the period.
There is no further recourse to other assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowings.
The warehouse facilities due for expiry in the period were all renewed on the same or improved terms.
As with the SPVs, the Group provides subordinated funding to the warehouse companies and restricted cash balances are held within them.
Contributions to the subordinated funding are made each time a drawing on the facility concerned is made.
These amounts provide credit enhancement to the warehouse and cover certain fees.
This funding is repaid when assets are securitised.
The amount of subordinated funding outstanding in the four active warehouse companies at 30 September 2015 was 54.9m 2014: 41.4m.
Further details of the warehouse facilities are given in note 50 and details of the loan assets within the warehouses are given in note 29.
The securitisation process and the terms of the warehouse facilities effectively limit liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
The remaining liquidity risk relates to ensuring that sufficient funding is available to fund the Groups participation in the SPVs, provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with ALCO which makes recommendations for the Groups liquidity policy for Board approval and uses detailed cash flow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.
The final repayment date for all of the securitisation borrowings and the old warehouse borrowing is more than five years from the balance sheet date, the earliest falling due in 2033 and the latest in 2050.
PAGE 172 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS The equivalent sterling principal amount outstanding at 30 September 2015 under the SPV and warehouse arrangements, allowing for the effect of the cross currency basis swaps, described under currency risk below, which are net settled with the loan payments, was 9,052.1m 2014: 8,829.6m.
The total sterling amount payable under these arrangements, were these principal amounts to remain outstanding until the final repayment date would be 15,157.8m 2014: 16,694.4m.
As the principal will, as discussed above, reduce as customers repay or redeem their accounts, the cash flow will in practice be far less than this amount.
In February 2013, the Company initiated a Euro Medium Term Note issuance programme, with a maximum issuance of 1,000.0m.
The Company had the ability to issue further notes under the programme within twelve months of its inauguration and it was subsequently renewed for a further twelve months in October 2014 and may be further renewed.
Since that time the Company has issued three fixed rate bonds for a total of 297.5m, with interest rates ranging from 6.000% to 6.125% and maturities ranging from December 2021 to August 2023, the most recent issue of 112.5m being made in August 2015.
The Groups investments in purchased loan portfolios and structured entities are funded from its free cash balances and securitisation borrowings and these investments carry no obligation to make further payments.
They therefore pose no liquidity risk to the Group.
The total undiscounted amounts, inclusive of estimated interest, which would be payable in respect of the Groups, and the Companys, non-securitisation borrowings and retail deposits, should those balances remain outstanding until the contracted repayment date, or the earliest date on which repayment can be required, are set out below.

The cash flows described above will include those for interest on borrowings accrued at 30 September 2015 disclosed in note 55.
In order to reduce the liquidity risk inherent in the retail deposit balances shown above, which are held by Paragon Bank PLC, its regulator, the PRA requires that it, like other regulated banks, maintains a buffer in the form of liquid assets to ensure it has sufficient available funds at all times to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
The amount of this buffer is calculated using Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG set by the PRA based on the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP submitted by Paragon Bank.
The ILAAP determines the liquid resources that must be maintained in the Bank based upon stress tests linked to its key liquidity risks and for other purposes specified by the regulator.
At 30 September 2015 the liquidity buffer of High Quality Liquid Assets HQLA comprised the following assets, all held within Paragon Bank.

As certain of the Groups financial assets and liabilities bear interest at rates which float with market rates and other are fixed, either for a term or for their whole lives a movement in market rates can change the net interest margin on the Groups activities unless the exposure is managed.
The Group manages this position outside Paragon Bank by maintaining floating rate liabilities and matching these with floating rate assets, by hedging fixed rate assets and liabilities using interest rate swap or cap agreements and by maintaining a proportion of fixed rate liabilities.
Separately, within Paragon Bank, where there are fixed and floating rate loan assets, together with fixed and floating rate savings deposit liabilities mismatches are managed using interest rate swap agreements to ensure any exposure remains appropriate to the Bankss risk appetite.
The Groups ALCO monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations and the terms of other borrowings.
Paragon Bank has its own ALCO which focuses on the risks within the Bank, including the retail deposit position, although the Groups committee maintains oversight.
The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset either quarterly or monthly on the basis of LIBOR.
Where asset backed loan notes are issued in foreign currencies, cross-currency basis swaps are put in place converting the reference interest rate to a sterling LIBOR basis.
The Groups retail deposits either bear variable interest rates or are fixed rate liabilities which are hedged in accordance with the Groups risk management strategy.
The interest rates paid on the Groups variable rate deposits are determined by reference to, inter alia, returns achievable in the Groups lending markets and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
The Groups loan assets predominantly bear LIBOR linked interest rates or are hedged fixed rate assets.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 175 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS Generally these factors ensure the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
The return to the Group from its investments in structured entities is primarily attributable to the cash generation of the underlying portfolio.
There is no direct exposure to market interest rate risk.
The Groups working capital borrowings comprise corporate bonds and retail bonds issued under a Euro Medium Term Note Programme.
All bonds issued to date have fixed interest rates and therefore are not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, although the retail bond programme includes the facility to issue floating rate instruments in the future.
The Group has entered into various interest rate basis swap arrangements to alter the effective basis of interest payments on certain borrowings to match the underlying assets, though due to their nature and low notional value, they do not have a significant impact on the Groups results.
To assess the Groups exposure to interest rate movements, the notional impact of a 1% change in UK interest rates on the equity of the Group at 30 September 2015, and the notional annualised impact of such a change on the operating profit of the Group, based on the year-end balance sheet have been calculated.
On this basis, a 1% increase in UK interest rates would reduce the Groups equity at 30 September 2015 by 3.1m 2014: 4.0m and increase profit before tax by 9.4m 2014: 11.3m.
This calculation allows only for the direct effects of any change in UK interest rates.
In practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially affect the Groups business and results.
Although certain of the Groups borrowings have interest rates dependant on US Dollar and Euro LIBOR rates, the effect of the cross currency basis swaps is such that the Groups results have no material exposure to movements in these rates.
The effects of independent 1% increases in US or Euro interest rates would be to increase the Groups equity by 1.1m 2014: 1.3m and 1.9m 2014: 2.0m respectively.
All the borrowings of the Company have fixed interest rates.
Assets and liabilities with other group companies bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR which reset within three months of the balance sheet date: all other balances are non-interest bearing.
Currency risk All of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling with the exception of the asset backed loan notes denominated in US dollars and euros, which are described in note 50.
Although IAS 39 requires that they be accounted for as currency liabilities and valued at their spot rates, a condition of the issue of these notes was that interest rate and currency swaps cross-currency basis swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing, having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked floating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk, and no sensitivity analysis is presented for currency risk.
