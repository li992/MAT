The critical accounting policies are listed below and explained in more detail in the relevant notes to the Group accounts: Critical accounting policy Description Notes Revenue and profit recognition 1 The recognition of revenue and profit The majority of long-term contracts are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction onlong-term contracts.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised when performance milestones have been completed.
The ultimate profitability of long-term contracts is estimated based on estimates of revenue and costs, including allowances for technical and other risks, which are reliant on the knowledge and experience of the Groups project managers, engineers, and finance and commercial professionals.
Material changes in these estimates could affect the profitability of individual contracts.
Revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances.
profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired.

In December 2015, BAE Systems, Airbus and the scheme trustees agreed to work towards the creation of a separate Airbus section of the Main Scheme in 2016 with the allocation of the deficit to the BAE Systems and Airbus sections based on each members last employer.
