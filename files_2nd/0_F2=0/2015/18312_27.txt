The Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 registration number 03853545.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is 1 Thornbury, West Ashland, Milton Keynes MK6 4BB.
The Companys Ordinary shares are listed on the Official List of the FCA and traded on the main market of the LSE.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted bytheEuropean Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the period ended 27 December 2015.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Please refer to the Directors report for further details.
Amounts reclassified As at 28 December 2014, quarterly rent in advance received from franchisees of 4,548,000 has been reclassified within current deferred income to better represent the nature of the liability, having previously been disclosed as part of accruals within current trade and other payables.
As at 28 December 2014, some credit balances in respect of rent-free periods received from landlords and payable to franchisees have been reclassified, resulting in an increase of 1,039,000 in non-current deferred income and 247,000 in current deferred income: previously 1,039,000 of these amounts were netted within non-current trade and other receivables and 247,000 in current trade and other receivables.
These adjustments had no effect on the income statement of the respective periods.
Discontinued operations In the Groups financial statements, the results and cash flows of discontinued operations are presented separately from those of continuing operations.
An operation is classified as discontinued if it is a component of the Group that i has been disposed of, or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and ii represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or will be disposed of as part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations.
Adoption of new and revised standards The following standards are effective for this financial year but have not had significant impact on the reported financial performance or position of the Group: o IFRS 12 Disclosure of involvement with other entities: The new standard covers the disclosures that were previously required in consolidated financial statements under IAS 27 consolidated and separate financial statements as well as those included in IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures and IAS 28 Investments in associates.
A number of additional disclosures are required by this new standard in respect of the Groups associates and joint ventures.
See note 20 for further information: o IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements: The new standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of which entities are controlled and are required to be consolidated.
This standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements.
The new standard did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group: o IFRS 11 Joint arrangements: The new standard replaces IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures and SIC 13 Jointly-controlled entities non-monetary contributions by ventures.
The standard defines contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and the accounting for joint operations and joint ventures.
The new standard did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group: o IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 28 Investments in Associates, has been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates.
The new standard did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group: o amendment to IAS 32 Offsetting Assets and Liabilities effective 1 January 2014 : These amendments clarify the meaning of currently legally enforceable right to set-off to reinforce that a right to setoff must not be contingent on any future event, including counterparty default or bankruptcy.
The Group does not have any significant offsetting financial instruments: o IFRIC Interpretation 21 Levies effective 1 January 2014 : The interpretation clarifies when an entity recognises a liability for a levy imposed by Government in accordance with legislation other than taxes and fines or other penalties.
The adoption of the amendment has no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: and o amendment to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets effective 1 January 2014 : This amendment clarifies the need forrecoverable amount disclosures to impaired non-financial assets only rather than all non-financial assets.
The adoption if the amendment has nosignificant impact on the Groups consolidated financial results.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 78 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Accounting policies continued Judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the period.
The nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The following judgements have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements: o franchisees within the Dominos Pizza system pay a percentage of their sales into a central fund designed to build store sales through increased public recognition of the Dominos Pizza brand the Fund.
The Fund is managed for the benefit of franchisees in the system with the objective of driving revenues for the franchised stores.
The Fund is used to pay for national marketing strategies and promotional plans.
The Fund is planned to operate atbreak-even with any short-term timing surplus or deficit carried in the Group balance sheet: o as all Fund income is designated for specific purposes and does not result in a profit or loss for the Group, the revenue recognition criteria as outlined in our accounting policy are not met and therefore the income and expenses of the Fund are not included in the Group income statement: o the assets and liabilities relating to the Fund are included in the appropriate headings in the Group balance sheet as the related legal, but not beneficial, rights and obligations rest with the Group.
These assets and liabilities include the short-term timing surpluses and deficits and any receivables and payables related to the Fund: and o the cash flows relating to the Fund are included within Cash generated from operations in the Group statement of cash flows due to the close interrelationship between the Fund and the trading operations of the Group.
The following estimates are dependent upon assumptions which could change in the next financial year and have a material effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognised at the balance sheet date: o A key source of estimation uncertainty that has a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is the estimation of share-based payment costs.
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, inputs for which arise from judgements relating to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees.
o Determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill acquired in business combinations requires the use of estimates regarding the value of the intangible assets and deferred consideration payable in particular.
These values are determined using discounted cash flows based on latest approved budgets which necessarily include estimates concerning factors such as levels of sales and timing of store openings.
Subsequent impairment reviews also require the use of estimates to value the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
These value in use calculations are re-run on an annual basis for goodwill or when there is an indicator of impairment for tangible and intangible fixed assets to determine whether there is any impairment to the carrying value of assets arising from business combinations.
o Certain of the Groups historic share-based compensation arrangements dating from 2003 to 2010 necessarily involve a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of their employment tax treatment.
The Group has received advice from its tax advisers reconfirming the support for the non-taxable accounting treatment of these arrangements following HMRCs protective assessments in prior years relating to these historic schemes.
The beneficiaries of the arrangements, which amongst others include certain current and former directors, have provided the Group with indemnities tosettle potential future personal tax liabilities should they crystallise.
This uncertainty may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the potential impact on the financial statements.
o The restructuring provision and asset impairments for the closure of the Germany operations are of uncertain timing and amount and therefore in making a reliable estimate of the quantum and timing of liabilities, judgement has been applied.
At 27 December 2015 provisions of 6,786,000 and impairments of 2,192,000 are recognised for the closure and wind up of the German operations.
o The classification of 935,000 of assets relating to the discontinued German operation as assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale is subject to some degree of estimation due to the estimation of the final level of assets and liabilities to be sold to the new associated operation.
Basis of consolidation The full year consolidated financial statements incorporate the results and net assets of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up on a52 week basis 2012: 53 weeks: 2017: 53 weeks to a Sunday either end of 31 December each year.
The interim results are prepared for the first 26 weeks of the relevant full period.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
Where necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align with the Group accounting policies.
All intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated uponconsolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly and indirectly, to the parent company and are presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Losses within a subsidiary areattributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
Dominos Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 79 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015 2.
Accounting policies continued Interests in associates and joint ventures The Groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Group has entered into a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These take the form of agreements to share control over other entities and share of rights to the net assets of the joint venture.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining significant influence on joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
Where the joint venture is established through an interest in a company, the Group recognises its interest in the entities assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
TheGroups income statement reflects the Groups share of the associate or joint ventures results after tax.
The Group statement of changes in equity reflects the Groups share of any income and expense recognised by the associate or joint venture outside profit and loss.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate or joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Groups share of the net fair value of the associate or joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the associate or joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the associate or joint ventures profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Financial statements of associates and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used in line with those of the Group, to take into account fair values assigned at the date of acquisition and to reflect impairment losses where appropriate.
Adjustments are also made in the Groups financial statements to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of each company in the Group is that of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The Groups most significant functional currency is sterling.
Transactions in other currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying spot exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing on the same date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and are taken directly to a translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group utilised the exemption available in IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences were deemed to be zero at 1 January 2006 thedate of transition to IFRS.
Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at the acquisition-date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation inaccordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of any contingent consideration deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39, either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest and, where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships orpost-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Identifiable intangible assets meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criteria are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest and where the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 80 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill continued After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Eachunit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
When goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation, when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed ofinthis circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
Intangible assets Computer software Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
Externally acquired computer software and software licences are capitalised at the cost incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Internally developed computer software programmes are capitalised to the extent that costs can be separately identified and attributed to particular software programmes, measured reliably, and that the asset developed can be shown to generate future economic benefits.
These assets are considered to have finite useful lives and are amortised on astraight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of each of the assets, considered to be between three and five years.
Master franchise fees Master franchise fees are fees paid towards the acquisition of the master franchise for the markets in which the Group operates.
These are carried atcost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
The useful economic lives of the assets are considered to be the life of the MFA they relate to which is typically 30 years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may notbe recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line method on the following bases: o Freehold land Not depreciated o Freehold buildings 50 years o Assets under construction Not depreciated o Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease o Fixtures and fittings Over five to 10 years o Supply Chain Centre equipment Over three to 30 years The assets residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, on an annual basis.
The majority of assets within Supply Chain Centre equipment are being depreciated over 10 years or more.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.
All items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prepaid short leasehold costs Prepaid short leasehold property costs are classified as current and non-current prepayments.
On initial recognition these assets are held at cost and subsequently at amortised cost over the length of the lease.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through sale rather than continuing use.
This condition isregarded as met if a sale is expected to materialise within 12 months after the balance sheet date and the asset is available for immediate disposal in its present condition.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
After classification as assets held for sale, no further depreciation is provided for on the assets.
Dominos Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 81 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015 2.
Accounting policies continued Leases Group as lessee Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
Allother leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held as finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease.
Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest in the remaining balance of the liability.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term.
Payments made to acquire operating leases are treated as prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Group as lessor Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Plant and equipment leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives.
Where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset, the arrangement is classified as a finance lease and a receivable is recognised for the initial direct costs of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably measured.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, itscarrying amount is the present value of those cash flows if the impact of discounting is material.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Present obligations arising under onerous lease contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist when the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is based onestimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to disposal.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 82 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have seven to 28 days terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full.
Balances are written off when the probability ofrecovery is considered remote.
The Group provides interest-free loans to assist franchisees in the opening of new stores.
The difference between the present value of loans recognised and the cash advanced has been capitalised as an intangible asset in recognition of the future value that will be generated via the royalty income and Supply Chain Centre sales that will be generated.
These assets are amortised over the life of a new franchise agreement of 10 years.
National Advertising Fund In addition to franchise fees, franchisees pay contributions which are collected by the Group for specific use within the national advertising fund.
TheGroup operates the funds on behalf of the franchisees with the objective of driving revenues for their stores.
The fund is specifically used to pay for marketing and advertising.
The fund is planned to operate at break-even with any short-term timing surplus or deficit carried in the Group balance sheet within working capital.
As all fund contributions are designated for specific purposes and do not result in a profit or loss for the Group, revenue recognition criteria are not met and therefore the income and expenses of the fund are not included in the Group income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity ofthreemonths or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or other cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenue and finance cost.
Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates andlaws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases and the accounting bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, with the following exceptions: o where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: o in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and o deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or losses can be utilised.
Income tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or to equity, in which case the income tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax relates to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction on either the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Pensions The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of certain staff with defined contribution schemes.
The contributions are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Any contributions unpaid atthe balance sheet date are included as an accrual at that date.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Capital reserve own shares Dominos Pizza Group plc shares held by the Company and its Employee Benefit Trust EBT are classified in shareholders equity as Capital reserve own shares and are recognised at cost.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase or sale of such shares.
Dominos Pizza Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 83 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015 2.
Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration net of returns, rebates and value-added taxes.
Franchisee rebates are recognised as an expense within revenue on an accruals basis on the expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance sheet date.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods Revenue from pizza delivery, Supply Chain Centres and equipment sales is recognised on delivery to customers andfranchisees.
Franchise fees The franchise fee is effectively a joining fee: it is non-refundable and no element of the franchise fee relates to subsequent services.
 fees is recognised when a franchisee opens a store for trading.
Royalties Royalties are based on Dominos Pizza store sales to customers and are recognised as the income is earned.
Rental income Rental income arising from leasehold properties is recognised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the lease terms.
Finance income Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are generally expensed as incurred.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset are capitalised while the asset is being constructed as part of the cost of that asset.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other finance costs that the Group incurs.
The policy is adopted for all assets that meet the definition of qualifying assets under IAS 23.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when: o expenditures for the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred: and o activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the asset is substantially ready for its intended use.
For borrowing associated with a specific asset, the actual borrowing costs less any investment income on temporary investment of those borrowings are capitalised.
To the extent funds are borrowed generally and used for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation shall be determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditure on that asset.
The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset.
Share-based payments The Group provides benefits to employees including Directors in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments equity-settled transactions.
The cost of the equity-settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair values of employee share option plans are calculated using the Hoadley model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 84 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments continued No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions and or service conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest on achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vested as described above.
The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with the corresponding increase in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
This includes any where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share further details aregiven in note 13.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 3 January 2005.
New standards and interpretations not applied At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU, none of which are anticipated to significantly impact the Groups results or assets and liabilities and are not expected to require significant disclosure apart from IFRS 16 on leases for which the Group is still determining the exact impact after its recent publication on 13 January 2016.

Segmental information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three geographical business units, based on the territories governed by the MFA: the UK, Ireland and Switzerland.
These are considered to be the Groups operating segments as the information provided to the chief operating decision makers, who are considered to be the Executive Directors of the Board, is based on these territories.
Revenue included in each includes all sales royalties, Supply Chain Centre sales, rental income and finance lease income made to franchise stores and by corporate stores located in that segment.
Segment results for the Ireland segment include both the ROI and Northern Ireland as both of these territories are served by the same Supply Chain Centre.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
Group financing including finance costs and finance revenue and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.
Unallocated assets include cash and cash equivalents and taxation assets.
Unallocated liabilities include the bank revolving facility, bank loans, deferred consideration and taxation liabilities.
In December 2015, the Group publicly announced that it had agreed to sell its German operations.
As the German business represented a separate major geographic area of operations we have classed this segment as a discontinued operation in the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015.
The segmental information on the following pages exclude the discontinued operation and so present the results of the Group split across the three remaining segments of the UK, Ireland and Switzerland, reflecting the basis on which the CODM will monitor the Groups results going forward.

In order to perform this test, management is required to compare the carrying value of the relevant cash generating unit CGU including the goodwill with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the valuation are those regarding discount rates, store openings and expected changes to level of sales in stores.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
Growth rates are based on market growth forecasts.
Changes in levels of AWUS average weekly unit sales and store openings are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the remaining term of the MFA based on the average long-term growth rate of 1.5% for Switzerland, which do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant market.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from the Swiss CGU is 10.6%.
The Group also has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU carrying value including reducing sales level and changing discount rates.
In respect of the Swiss CGU, no reasonably expected change would give rise to an impairment charge.
Master franchise fees Master franchise fees consist of costs relating to the MFA for the UK, ROI, Germany and Switzerland.
The UK and ROI MFA runs into perpetuity, witha development clause that is renewable on a 10 year basis.

As a company with an established leasing trade, Dominos Leasing owns the leased equipment and is entitled to an ongoing rental income from each lease for the remaining term of that lease and it is entitled to certain tax reliefs from its ownership of that equipment.
On acquisition, the tax reliefs available had a total value of 29,240,000 and a deferred consideration of 15,364,000 was payable, the amount and timing of which depends on the amount and timing of the benefits totheGroup arising from this tax relief.
The deferred consideration is payable until April 2016.
During the period the Group has utilised 7,032,000 2014: 8,532,000 of the capital allowances which were acquired with Dominos Leasing Limited.
The utilisation of these capital allowances reduces the value of the deferred tax asset which was recognised on acquisition: however, itresults in no overall impact on the tax charge for the period as there is an equal and opposite reduction in the Groups corporation tax liability.
On 24 September 2012, the Group acquired the trade and assets of a business in Switzerland on which contingent consideration was payable.
Thefair value of contingent consideration at the time of acquisition was estimated to be 1,087,000.
In 2014, the amount payable crystallised at134,000 and the unutilised provision for contingent consideration was released to the profit and loss.
Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts Operating lease commitments where the Group is lessee For the stores in the franchisee system, the Group has entered into commercial leases, taking the head lease and then subletting the properties to the franchisees.
These leases have an average duration of between 10 and 25 years.
Under the terms of the franchise agreement the franchisee is granted an initial period of 10 years to operate a Dominos Pizza delivery store under the Dominos system.
Under the agreement, the franchisee also has the option to renew for a further 10 years at the end of the initial period provided at the time of the renewal the franchisee is not in default of any material provision of the franchise agreement.
In addition the Group has entered into commercial leases on motor vehicles and items of plant, machinery and equipment.
These leases have an average duration of between three and five years.
Only the property lease agreements contain an option for renewal, with such options being exercisable three months before the expiry of the lease term at rentals based on market prices at the time of exercise.

These properties include sublets tocommercial tenants, properties for which a lease has been signed but no franchisee has been identified to operate the store such that the lease obligation has become onerous, along with stores for which the tenant is paying reduced rent and the Group expects to make a loss in relation to the lease.
The provision will be utilised over the remaining lease term on the properties identified which range between one and 24 years.
Of the amount arising in the year 2,486,000 relates to amounts provided in Germany due to discontinuation of operations.
Restructuring provisions 2,918,000 of the provision relates to the discontinuation of Germany operations and relates to closure costs of the head office and some stores.
The remaining restructuring provision arose upon acquisition of Dominos Switzerland and relates to outstanding rent obligations for three stores which were being closed and relocated as well as other commitments arising from the restructuring plan such as relocation costs.
The total restructuring provision will be utilised within three years.
Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups financial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring those risks, which have an adverse impact on the value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities or on reported profitability and on the cash flows of the Group.
The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans, bank revolving facilities, other loans and finance leases.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or financial foreign currency contracts.
It is, and has been throughout 2015 and 2014, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
The Groups main treasury risks relate to the availability of funds to meet its future requirements and fluctuations in interest rates.
The treasury policy of the Group is determined and monitored by the Board.
The Group monitors its cash resources through short, medium and long-term cash forecasting, against available facilities.
Surplus cash is pooled into an interest bearing account with the Groups bankers.
The Group monitors its overall level of financial gearing monthly, with short and medium-term forecasts showing levels of gearing within targets.
It is the Groups policy not to have high financial leverage, comparing net debt to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
Dominos Pizza Group plc 104 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations in ROI, Germany and Switzerland and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than sterling.
As a result, the value of the Groups non-sterling revenues, purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, the euro in particular.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its currency exposures by agreeing fixed euro rates with franchisees and suppliers wherever possible.
The Board does not consider there to be any significant unmitigated foreign currency risk in relation to the Groups profit before tax.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the sterling against euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups equity due to changes in the carrying value of euro-denominated assets in subsidiaries with a sterling functional currency and sterling-denominated assets in subsidiaries with a euro functional currency : Increase Effect decrease on profit in sterling vs before tax euro rate % 000 2015 25 37 25 54 2014 25 29 25 43 Credit risk Customers who trade on credit terms and obtain finance leasing and loans from the Group are predominantly franchisees and it is considered that the franchisee selection process is sufficiently robust to ensure an appropriate credit verification procedure.
In addition, trade receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Since the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to the franchisee selection process and provide guarantees as required under the franchisee agreements, there is no requirement for collateral.
It is Group policy that cash deposits are only made with banks that have been approved by the Board and have a high credit rating in accordance with the Groups treasury policy to ensure that the Group is not exposed to unnecessary risk.
Liquidity risk The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations with cash collection targets set throughout the Group.
Allmajor investment decisions are considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal and approval process.
In this way the Group aims tomaintain a good credit rating to facilitate fundraising.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 27 December 2015 and 28 December 2014 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Whilst fixed rate interest bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to benefit from a reduction in borrowing costs when market rates are declining.
Conversely, whilst floating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk as costs are impacted by changes in market rates.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the 52-week period ended 27 December 2015 would decrease increase by 214,000 2014: 56,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
There would be no impact on other comprehensive income.
