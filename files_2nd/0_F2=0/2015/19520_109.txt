Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued The sensitivity of the pension plan and medical and other post-retirement benefit liabilities at 31 March 2015 to changes in the principal actuarial assumptions is as follows.
Medical and other Defined benefit pension plans post-retirement benefits Change in Increase Decrease Increase Decrease assumption US$m US$m US$m US$m Discount rate 1% 72 94 6 7 Salary growth rate 1% 7 7 Pension growth rate 1% 86 48 Life expectancy 1 year 11 11 2 2 Healthcare cost inflation 1% 7 6 The above sensitivity analyses assume a change in a single assumption while all other assumptions are held constant.
When calculating the sensitivities, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, consistent with the method used to calculate the defined benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and assumptions used to prepare the sensitivity analyses are consistent with those used in the prior year.
For funded defined benefit plans, the group is required to provide funding where the fair value of the assets of the scheme are not sufficient to meet the defined benefit obligations.
The South Africa pension schemes no longer have any active members, therefore, funding will only be required in the event that the scheme becomes less than 100% funded.
The remaining funded defined benefit plans are funded using recommendations provided by the schemes actuaries.
Contributions expected to be paid into the groups major defined benefit schemes during the year ending 31 March 2016 are US$19 million.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 16 years.
