Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, and whether they are effective in 2015 or later years.
Weexplain how these changes are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
The financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interests in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
As required by European Union law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 the Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS, and approved by the Directors.
The financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historical cost.
Where other bases are applied these are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS101.
Going concern At 31 December 2015 the Group was in a net debt position.
The Groups strong balance sheet and continued generation of significant free cash flows has enabled further acquisitions as well as the payment of a special dividend.
The Group has also sought to gain further efficiencies in the balance sheet and maintain the flexibility to invest in the business by issuing a new Eurobond see section 4 for details oncapital structure and financing.
The Group continues to review forecasts of the television advertising market to determine the impact onITVs liquidity position.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its currentfunding.
The Group also continues to focus on development of the non-advertising business, and evaluates the impact of further investment in acquisitions against the strategy and cash headroom of the business.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for at least twelve months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, theGroup continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and available for sale investments Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method.
Under the equity method the investment in the entity is stated as one line item at cost plus the investors share of retained post-acquisition profits and other changes in net assets.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the financial and operating decisions of an entity.
These investments are also accounted for using the equity method.
Investments where the Group concludes it does not have significant influence are deemed available for sale.
These investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case itisvalued at cost and assessed for impairment.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 103 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 1: Basis of Preparation continued Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Groups operating cycle.
All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in thecourse of the Groups operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date.
Allother liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
Classification of financial instruments The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are classified into the following financial statement captions in the statement of financial position in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Loans and receivables separately disclosed as cash and cash equivalents excluding gilts over which unfunded pension commitments have a charge and trade and other receivables Available for sale financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Includes gilts over which unfunded pension commitments have a charge Financial assets liabilities at fair value through profit or loss separately disclosed as derivative financial instruments in assets liabilities and included in non-current other payables contingent consideration and Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost separately disclosed as borrowings and trade and otherpayables Judgement is required when determining the appropriate classification of the Groups financial instruments.
Details on the accounting policies for measurement of the above instruments are set out inthe relevant note.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it becomes a party to the contract.
Financial instruments are no longer recognised in the statement of financial position when the contractual cash flows expire or when the Group no longer retains control of substantially all the risks and rewards under the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits with a maturity of less than or equal to threemonths from the date of acquisition, cash held to meet certain finance lease commitments and gilts inrespect of which a charging deed was executed on the unfunded pension commitments of four former Granada executives.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to approximate fair value.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which the Group operates is the UK and therefore the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
Where Group companies based in the UK transact in foreign currencies, these transactions are translated intopounds sterling at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Where there is a movement in theexchange rate between the date of the transaction and the year end, a foreign exchange gain or loss isrecognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is implemented on certain foreign currency firm commitments, which allows for the effective portion of any foreign exchange gains or losses to be recognised in other comprehensive income note 4.3.
Where a forward currency contract is used to manage foreign exchange risk and hedge accounting is not applied, any movement in currency is taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into pounds sterling at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of the UK are translated into pounds sterling at the yearend exchange rate.
The revenue and expenses of these companies are translated into pounds sterling atthe average monthly exchange rate during the year.
Where differences arise between these rates, they arerecognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
104 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates arerecognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a subsidiary outside the UK or an interest in a joint venture or an associate, the related translation reserve is released to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Revenue recognition note 2.1 Business combinations note 3.3 and note 3.4 Allocation of goodwill and assets to CGUs and impairment of assets note 3.3 In addition to the above, the areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Defined benefit pension schemes, including the related longevity swap note 3.7 Taxation note 2.3 New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards The table below represents new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards relevant to the Groups results that are effective in 2015: Accounting Standard Requirement Impact on financial statements IAS 19 Employee The amendment was to simplify the accounting for The amendment has not had Benefits contributions that are independent of the number of years anyimpact on the Group.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 105 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year In this section This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, exceptional items, taxation and earnings per share.
2.1 Profit Keeping it This section analyses the Groups profit before tax by reference to the activities simple performed by the Group and an analysis of key operating costs.
before tax Earnings before interest, tax, amortisation EBITA and before exceptional items remains the Groups key profit indicator.
This reflects the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group.
This section therefore also shows each divisions contribution to total revenue and EBITA.
Accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and comprises the sale of products and services to third parties.
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate timing and amount of revenue that can be recognised, specifically around whether there is a firm contract and that the service has been provided, and if so, whether there is a fixed or reasonably determinable price that is reasonably certain will be collected.
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised when the Group has transferred both the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control of the products sold, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue recognition criteria for the Groups key classes of revenue are recognised on the followingbases: Applicable segment Class of revenue Recognition criteria Broadcast & Online Advertising NAR, Video on Demand on transmission, as audience targets are met VOD Broadcast & Online Sponsorship across period of transmission of the sponsored programme or series Broadcast & Online Pay over the term of the contract or accrued in the month for the expected revenue per subscriber or download and trued up on receipt of thirdparty reports showing revenue share calculation showing subscribers or number of downloads Broadcast & Online Participation Interactive & Brand as the service is provided or event occurs Extensions Studios Programme production on delivery of episode and acceptance by the customer Studios Programme distribution rights when the contract is signed and content is available for exploitation Studios Format and licences at the point in time when the license is transferred and the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence Studios Digital: Archive on delivery of content one-off or over the contract period in a manner that reflects the flow of content delivered top-up 106 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements The results for the year aggregate these classes of revenue into four significant categories: 2015 2014 m m Broadcast & Online NAR 1,719 1,629 Non-NAR 427 394 ITV Studios Productions 1,045 789 Distribution 192 144 Total revenue 3,383 2,956 Segmental information Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are determined in a manner that is consistent with how the business is managed and reported to the Board of Directors.
The Board is regarded as the chief operating decision maker.
The Board considers the business primarily from an operating activity perspective.
The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 are therefore Broadcast & Online and ITV Studios, the results of which are outlined in the following tables: Broadcast & Online ITV Studios Consolidated 2015 2015 2015 m m m Total segment revenue 2,146 1,237 3,383 Intersegment revenue 411 411 Revenue from external customers 2,146 826 2,972 EBITA before exceptional items 659 183 842 Share of losses of joint ventures and associated undertakings Broadcast & Online ITV Studios Consolidated 2014 2014 2014 m m m Total segment revenue 2,023 933 2,956 Intersegment revenue 366 366 Revenue from external customers 2,023 567 2,590 EBITA before exceptional items 568 162 730 Share of losses of joint ventures and associated undertakings Revenue of 389 million 2014: 255 million was generated in the US during the year, and represented 314 million 2014: 297 million of non-current assets at year end.
Intersegment revenue, which is carried out on arms length terms, is generated from the supply of ITV Studios programmes to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily on ITV.
This revenue stream is a measure which forms part of the Groups strategic priority of building a strong international content business, as by producing and retaining rights to the broadcast shows the Group benefits further from subsequent international content and format sales.
In preparing the segment information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable segments on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each segment.
This is consistent with the basis of reporting to the Board of Directors.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 107 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued Broadcast & Online The Group operates the largest commercial family of channels in the UK and delivers content through traditional television broadcasting.
In addition to linear broadcast, the Group delivers its content on multiple platforms including the ITV Hub, pay platforms, or through direct content deals.
Content, that is commissioned and scheduled by this segment, is funded primarily by television advertising, where revenue is generated from the sale of audiences for advertising airtime and sponsorship.
Other sources of revenue are from: online advertising, HD digital channels on pay platforms e. g. Sky and Virgin, SDN revenue which generates licence sales for DTT Multiplex A, and participation revenue which includes interactive sales from competitions and ITV Choice in other countries.
ITV Studios ITV Studios is the Groups international content business, creating and producing programmes and formats that return and travel, namely drama, entertainment and factual entertainment.
ITV Studios UK is the largest commercial producer in the UK and produces programming for the Groups own channels, accounting for 60% of ITV main channel spend on commissioned programming.
Programming is also sold to other UK broadcasters such as the BBC, Channel 4 andSky.
ITV America is the largest unscripted independent producer of content in the US and is growing its scripted presence by increasing investment in high profile dramas straight to series.
ITV Studios also operates in five other international locations being Australia, Germany, France, Netherlands primarily Talpa and the Nordics, where content is produced for local broadcasters.
This content is either locally created IP or formats that have been created elsewhere by ITV, primarily in the UK.
Global Entertainment and Talpa Global, ITVs distribution businesses, license ITVs finished programmes and formats and third-party content internationally.
Within this business we also finance productions both on and off ITV toacquire global distribution rights.
EBITA before exceptional items The Directors assess the performance of the reportable segments based on a measure of EBITA before exceptional items.
The Directors use this measurement basis as it excludes the effect of non-recurring income and expenditure.
Amortisation and share of profit losses of joint ventures and associates are also excluded to reflect more accurately how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Netfinancing costs and tax are not allocated to segments as the funding, cash and tax management ofthe Group are activities carried out by the central treasury and tax functions.
A reconciliation from EBITA before exceptional items to profit before tax is provided as follows: 2015 2014 m m EBITA before exceptional items 842 730 Operating exceptional items 109 12 Amortisation of intangible assets 67 67 Net financing costs 31 51 Share of losses of joint ventures and associated undertakings Gain on sale of non-current assets exceptional items 5 4 Gain on sale of subsidiaries and investments exceptional items 1 1 Profit before tax 641 605 The Groups principal operations are in the United Kingdom.

There are two media buying agencies 2014: two acting on behalf of a number of customers that represent the Groups major customers.
These agencies are the only customers which individually represent over 10% of the Groups revenue.
Revenue of approximately 576 million 2014: 571 million and339 million 2014: 312 million was derived from these customers.
This revenue is attributable to theBroadcast & Online segment.

110 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 2.2 Keeping it Exceptional items are excluded from managements assessment of profit simple because by their size or nature they could distort the Groups underlying quality Exceptional of earnings.
They are typically gains or losses arising from events that are not items considered part of the core operations of the business e. g. costs relating to capital transactions, such as professional fees on acquisitions.
These items are excluded to reflect performance in a consistent manner and are in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Accounting policies Exceptional items as described above are disclosed on the face of the income statement.
Subsequent revisions of estimates for items initially recognised as exceptional are recorded as exceptional items in the year that the revision is made.
Gains or losses on disposal of non-core assets are also considered exceptional due to their nature and impact on the Groups underlying quality of earnings.
Exceptional items Operating and non-operating exceptional items are analysed as follows: 2015 2014 Charge credit Ref.
m m Operating exceptional items: Acquisition-related expenses A 88 6 Reorganisation and restructuring costs B 13 6 Legal related costs E 8 Total net operating exceptional items 109 12 Non-operating exceptional items: Gain on sale of non-current assets C 5 4 Gain on sale and impairment of subsidiaries and investments D 1 1 Total non-operating exceptional items 6 5 Total exceptional items before tax 103 7 Tax on exceptional items 8 2 Total exceptional items net of tax 95 5 A Acquisition-related expenses Acquisition-related expenses of 88 million includes 78 million 2014: 3 million relating to performancebased, employment linked costs to former owners mainly in relation to Talpa Media, and professional fees mainly financial and legal due diligence incurred on the acquisitions completed during the year of 10million 2014: 3 million.
See note 3.4 for further details on acquisitions.
B Reorganisation and restructuring costs In 2015 13 million 2014: 6 million of costs were incurred as a result of a Group-wide initiative to significantly reduce the ongoing cost base, primarily comprised of restructuring of the US business, redundancy and excess space provisions.
C Gain on sale of non-current assets In 2015 a 5 million gain on sale of non-current assets arose primarily as a result of the sale of a freehold property and related assets in Manchester.
The 2014 gain of 4 million arose as a result of the sale of a freehold property in Cardiff.
D Gain on sale and impairment of subsidiaries and investments The gain of 1 million 2014: 1 million relates to a historical disposal.
E Legal related costs 8 million 2014: nil provision for anticipated costs of settling a legal dispute.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 111 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued 2.3 Keeping it This section sets out the Groups tax accounting policies, the current and deferred simple tax charges or credits in the year which together make up the total tax charge or Taxation credit in the income statement, a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax charge for the period and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income and directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
The calculation of the Groups tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be fully determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes thatare likely to become due, which require judgement.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than ina business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will beavailable to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves judgement regarding the timing and level of future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set-off.
112 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Taxation Income statement The total taxation charge in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Current tax: Current tax charge before exceptional items 125 118 Current tax credit charge on exceptional items 6 2 119 120 Adjustments to prior periods 9 6 110 126 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of temporary differences 20 9 Deferred tax credit on exceptional items 2 Impact of change in the statutory tax rate 2 20 9 Adjustments to prior periods 9 3 29 6 Total taxation charge in the income statement 139 132 In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax charge of 139 million 2014: 132 million arises on a profit before tax of 641 million 2014: 605 million, the taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2015 2014 m m Profit before tax 641 605 Notional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 20.25% 2014: 21.5% on profit before tax 130 130 Non-taxable income non-deductible expenses 23 2 Adjustments to prior periods 3 Impact of overseas tax rates 7 1 Impact of changes in tax rates 2 Production tax credits 23 Total taxation charge in the income statement 139 132 Non-deductible expenses are expenses that are not expected to be allowable for tax purposes.
Similarly non-taxable income is income that will not be taxed.
Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcome is obtained on certain tax matters whichdiffers from expectations held when the related provision was made.
Where the outcome is more favourable than the provision made, the difference is released, lowering the current year tax charge.
Wherethe outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur.
The impact of overseas tax rates reflects the fact that some of our profits are earned in territories other than the UK, and taxed at rates different to the UK corporation tax rate.
On 26 October 2015, the UK corporation tax rate was substantively enacted to fall to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020.
The carrying value of UK temporary differences at the balance sheet date has been adjusted accordingly.
This has given rise to a charge of 1 million 2014: nil million of which 2 million is recognised as a charge in the income statement and 1m as a credit in other comprehensive income.
Production tax credits are incentives provided to creative industries such as UK High-End Television HETV tax relief.
The ability to access these tax credits is fundamental when assessing the viability of investment decisions in the production of high-end drama.
Under IFRS certain production tax credits are reported within thetotal taxation charge in the income statement, however ITV considers them to be working capital innature, and excludes them from its adjusted tax charge, including them instead within Adjusted EBITA.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 113 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued The effective tax rate is the tax charge on the face of the income statement expressed as a percentage of the profit before tax.
In the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, the effective tax rate iscomparable to the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
As explained in the Financial and Performance Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to show how tax impacts total adjusted earnings in a way that is more aligned with the Groups cash tax position.
Taxation Other comprehensive income and equity As analysed in the table below, a deferred tax charge of 19 million on actuarial movements on pensions has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
A deferred tax charge of 2 million has been recognised in equity in respect of share based payments.
A current tax credit of 7 million has also been recognised in equity in relation to share based payments.
Taxation Statement of financial position The table below outlines the deferred tax assets liabilities that are recognised in the statement of financial position, together with their movements in the year: At Recognised in At 1 January the income Recognised in Business 31 December 2015 statement OCI and equity acquisitions 2015 m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 1 1 Intangible assets 15 10 76 101 Programme rights 1 1 Pension scheme deficits 36 16 19 1 Tax losses 7 3 4 Share-based compensation 14 1 2 11 Other temporary differences 1 4 5 43 29 21 72 79 At Recognised in At 1 January the income Recognised in Business 31 December 2014 statement OCI and equity acquisitions 2014 m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 6 5 1 Intangible assets 13 2 15 Programme rights 1 1 Pension scheme deficits 56 16 4 36 Tax losses 2 5 7 Share-based compensation 13 1 14 Other temporary differences 1 2 1 52 6 3 43 The prior year movements on deferred tax relating to overseas businesses have been reallocated to the relevant temporary difference categories.
At 31 December 2015, total deferred tax assets are 22 million 2014: 55 million and total deferred tax liabilities are 101 million 2014: 12 million.
After netting off balances within countries, there is a net deferred tax liability of 79m 2014: net deferred tax asset of 43 million recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The deferred tax balance relates to: property, plant and equipment temporary differences arising on assets qualifying for tax depreciation temporary differences on intangible assets arising on business combinations programme rights temporary differences on intercompany profits on stock pension scheme deficit temporary differences on the IAS 19 pension deficit and additional contributions resulting from funding through the SDN and LTVC pension partnerships not recognised as contributions under IAS 19 temporary differences arising from the timing of the use of tax losses share-based compensation temporary differences on share schemes and other temporary differences on provisions and other items 114 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit has been adjusted to reflect the current tax benefit obtained in the current year following the employer contributions of 102 million to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
The adjustment in other comprehensive income to the deferred tax balance primarily relates tothe actuarial gains recognised in the period.
A deferred tax asset of 399 million 2014: 444 million in respect of capital losses of 2,215 million 2014:2,221 million has not been recognised due to uncertainties as to whether a capital gain will arise inthe appropriate form and relevant territory against which such losses could be utilised.
Forthe same reasons, deferred tax assets in respect of overseas losses of 15 million 2014: 14 million that time expire between 2017 and 2026 have not been recognised.
2.4 Keeping it Earnings per share EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share.
simple Earnings Basic EPS is calculated on the Group profit for the year attributable to equity per share shareholders of 495 million 2014: 466 million divided by 4,006 million 2014: 4,002million being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS reflects any commitments made by the Group to issue shares in the future and so it includes the impact of share options.
Adjusted EPS is presented in order to show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Adjusted EPS reflects the impact of operating and non-operating exceptional items on Basic EPS.
Other items excluded from Adjusted EPS include amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired through business combinations: net financing cost adjustments and the tax adjustments relating to these items.
Each of these adjustments are explained in detail in the section below.
The calculation of Basic EPS and Adjusted EPS, together with the diluted impact on each, is set out below: Earnings per share 2015 Basic Diluted Ref.

Refer to Note 2.2 for the detailed composition of after tax impact of exceptional items both operating and non operating of 95 million 2014: 5 million.
B. Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets of 58 million 2014: 44 million is excluded from adjusted profit.
It is calculated as total amortisation and impairment of 67 million 2014: 67 million, less amortisation of software licences and development of 9million 2014: 11 million.
A related tax credit of 13 million 2014:12million is also excluded in arriving at the net amount, which is further adjusted to recognise the 9 million cash tax benefit arising from goodwill on US acquisitions, which for taxpurposes is amortised over a 15 year period 2014: 5 million shown within other tax adjustments.
C. Gross adjustments of 18 million 2014: 44 million have been made to net financing costs and relate to mark-to-market movements on derivative instruments, losses on buybacks and imputed pension interest charges see note 4.4 for details.
This is reduced by a tax credit of 3 million 2014: 10 million to give a net adjustment of 15 million 2014: 34 million.
116 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities In this section This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
On the following pages there are notes covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, acquisitions and disposals, provisions and pensions.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in Section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
3.1 Keeping it Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through simple its trading activity.
The Group therefore defines working capital as distribution Working rights, programme rights and production costs, trade and other receivables and capital trade and other payables.
Careful management of working capital ensures that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
Working capital is a driver of the profit to cash conversion, a key performance indicator for the Group.
The Groups target profit to cash ratio on a rolling three year basis is at least 90%.
For those subsidiaries acquired during the year, working capital at the date of acquisition is excluded from the profit to cash calculation so that only subsequent working capital movements in the period owned by ITV are reflected in this metric.
In the following section you will find further information regarding working capital management and analysis of the elements of working capital.
1 Distribution rights Accounting policies Distribution rights are programme rights the Group buys from producers to derive future revenue, principally through licensing to broadcasters.
These are classified as non-current assets as these rights areused to derive long-term economic benefit for the Group.
Distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and charged through operating costs in the income statement over a maximum five year period that is dependent on either cumulative sales and programme genre, or based on forecast future sales.
Advances paid for the acquisition of distribution rights are disclosed as distribution rights as soon as they are contracted.
These advances are not expensed until theprogramme is available for distribution.
Up to that point they are assessed annually for impairment through the reassessment of the future sales expected to be earned from that title.
The net book value of distribution rights at the year end are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Distribution rights 29 13 The movement during the year comprises additions of 43 million 2014: 21 million and amounts charged to the income statement of 27 million 2014: 18 million.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 117 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued 3.1.
2 Programme rights and other inventory Accounting policies Rights are recognised when the Group controls the respective rights and the risks and rewards associated with them.
Programme rights and production costs not yet written off are included in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Broadcast programme rights Acquired programme rights which include films, and sports rights, are purchased for the primary purpose of broadcasting on the ITV network.
These are recognised within current assets as payments are made orwhen the rights are ready for broadcast.
The Group generally expenses these rights through operating costs over a number of transmissions reflecting the pattern and value in which the right is consumed.
Commissions, which primarily comprise programmes purchased based on editorial specification and overwhich the Group has some control, are recognised in current assets as payments are made and aregenerally expensed to operating costs in full on first transmission.
Where a commission is repeated, incremental costs associated with the broadcast are included in operating costs.
In assessing net realisable value for acquired and commissioned rights, the net realisable value assessment is based on estimated airtime value, with consideration given to whether the number of transmissions purchased can be efficiently played out over the licence period.
Studios production costs Production inventory comprises the costs incurred by ITV Studios in producing a programme, where the programme is part way through the production process and not yet available for delivery to a broadcaster.
They are recognised within current assets at the production cost incurred, and are expensed in operating costs on delivery of episodes.
Also included here are dramas that have been commissioned straight to series.
Although more expensive than producing a pilot, this method attracts high profile talent to the production and raises the profile of the series to support its distribution.
The production cost is partly funded by the commissioning network licence fee, the remaining production deficit is recovered by future distribution sales, and once the production is complete any remaining deficit is classified as a Distribution Right.
In assessing net realisable value for programmes in production, judgement is required when considering the contracted sales price and estimated costs to complete.
The Groups programme rights and other inventory at the year end are shown in the table below: 2015 2014 m m Broadcast Acquired programme rights 111 101 Commissions 61 57 Sports rights 30 40 ITV Studios Production costs 171 169 373 367 118 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 3.1.
3 Programme commitments These are operating commitments in respect of programming entered into in the ordinary course of business with programme suppliers, sports organisations and film distributors in respect of rights to broadcast on the ITV network.
Commitments in respect of these purchases, which are not reflected in thestatement of financial position, are due for payment as follows: 2015 2014 m m Within one year 451 464 Later than one year and not more than five years 633 462 More than five years 141 58 1,225 984 3.1.
4 Trade and other receivables Accounting policies Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Where payments are not due for more than one year, they are shown in the financial statements at their net present value to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment.
The Group provides goods and services to substantially all its customers on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, becollected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience, the current state of the UK andoverseas economies and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Due within one year: Trade receivables 328 271 Other receivables 37 27 Prepaid employment linked consideration see note 3.4 55 Prepayments and accrued income 111 87 531 385 Due after more than one year: Trade receivables 8 7 Prepaid employment linked consideration see note 3.4 18 Other receivables 7 17 Total trade and other receivables 564 409 Prepaid employment linked consideration totalling 73 million relates to the acquisition of Talpa Media see note 3.4 for details.
This represents the portion of the initial consideration that is recoverable from the seller in the event he leaves within the initial two years following acquisition and is amortised over thatperiod.
336 million 2014: 278 million of total trade receivables that are not impaired are aged as follows: 2015 2014 m m Current 308 263 Up to 30 days overdue 17 7 Between 30 and 90 days overdue 8 4 Over 90 days overdue 3 4 336 278 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 119 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued The balance above is stated net of a provision of 5 million 2014: 7 million for impairment of trade receivables.
Of the provision total, 4 million relates to balances overdue by more than 90 days 2014:3million and 1 million relates to current balances 2014: 4 million.
Movements in the Groups provision for impairment of trade receivables can be shown as follows: 2015 2014 m m At 1 January 7 7 Charged during the year 3 2 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectable utilisation of provision Unused amounts reversed 5 2 At 31 December 5 7 3.1.
5 Trade and other payables due within one year Accounting policies Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier.
The carrying value of current and non-current trade payables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Trade payables 65 49 VAT and social security 71 68 Other payables 177 159 Accruals 289 250 Deferred income 184 173 786 699 3.1.
6 Trade payables due after more than one year Trade payables due after more than one year can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Trade payables 48 27 This primarily relates to film creditors for which payment is due after more than one year.
7 Working capital management Cash and working capital management continues to be a key focus.
During the year the cash outflow from working capital was 59 million 2014: outflow of 69 million derived as follows: 2015 2014 m m Decrease increase in programme rights and other inventory and distribution rights 4 39 Increase decrease in receivables 21 18 Decrease in payables 42 48 Working capital outflow 59 69 The working capital outflow for the year excludes the impact of balances acquired on the acquisition of subsidiaries during the year see note 3.4.
120 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 3.2 Keeping it The following section shows the physical assets used by the Group to operate the simple business, generating revenues and profits.
These assets include office buildings Property, and studios, as well as equipment used in broadcast transmission, programme plant and production and support activities.
equipment The cost of these assets is the amount initially paid for them.
A depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used useful economic life.
If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the Directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific estimates made in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Certain service contracts involve the use of specific assets e. g. transmission equipment and therefore contain an embedded lease.
Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires judgement as to whether substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to the Group.
Estimates used by management in making this assessment include the useful economic life of assets, the fair value of the asset and the discount rate applied to the total payments required under the lease.
Assets held under such leases areincluded within property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on an effective interest basis.
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term see note 2.1 for further details of operating lease commitments.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles, equipment and fittings 3 to 20 years Equipment includes studio production and technology assets.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 121 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment that is subject to depreciation is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Indicators of impairment may include changes in technology and business performance.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment can be analysed as follows: Freehold land Improvements to leasehold Vehicles, equipment and buildings land and buildings and fittings Total Finance Long Short Owned leases m m m m m m Cost At 1 January 2014 137 69 17 221 16 460 Additions 26 26 Reclassification of property fittings 2 2 Disposals and retirements 17 12 29 At 31 December 2014 120 67 17 237 16 457 Additions 1 37 38 Disposals and retirements 31 1 10 42 At 31 December 2015 89 66 18 264 16 453 Depreciation At 1 January 2014 23 11 15 138 14 201 Charge for the year 1 2 24 27 Disposals and retirements 7 12 19 At 31 December 2014 17 13 15 150 14 209 Charge for the year 1 2 24 27 Disposals and retirements 12 1 9 22 At 31 December 2015 6 14 15 165 14 214 Net book value At 31 December 2015 83 52 3 99 2 239 At 31 December 2014 103 54 2 87 2 248 Additions in the year includes 6 million 2014: 5 million relating to assets owned by subsidiaries acquired during the year.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction of 16 million 2014:10 million.
During the year, the Group disposed of the Quay Street site and related assets in Manchester for 23 million, representing a gain on sale of 5 million.
In 2014, the Group sold a freehold property in Cardiff for proceeds of 15 million, representing a gain on sale of 5 million.
In 2013 the Group acquired the freehold for the London Television Centre for 58 million, although the Directors view is that fair value of the property would be significantly higher.
Capital commitments There are 2 million of capital commitments at 31 December 2015 2014: 2 million.
122 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 3.3 Keeping it The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to simple generate revenue and profits.
Intangible assets These assets include formats and brands, customer contracts and relationships, contractual arrangements, licences, software development, film libraries and goodwill.
The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired.
The value of goodwill is intangible value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong market position and the outstanding productivity of its employees.
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the number of years the Group expects to use the asset, the useful economic life, via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement.
Where there has been atechnological change or decline in business performance the Directors review the value of assets, including goodwill, to ensure they have not fallen below their amortised value.
Should an assets value fall below its amortised value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
This section explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the net book value of theseassets.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen asaresult of business combinations.
Goodwill is stated at its recoverable amount being cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to the business to which it relates.
Due to changes in accounting standards goodwill has been calculated using three different methods depending on the date the relevant business was purchased.
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the acquisition method.
Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognition of any part of the business not yet owned non-controlling interests, less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration expected to be transferred in the future will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and recognised within other payables.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash flows.
The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate.
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and call and put options are granted over the remaining interest, a non-controlling interest is initially recognised in equity at fair value, which is established based on the value of the put option.
A call option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, carried at fair value.
The put option is recognised as a liability within other payables, carried at the present value of the put option exercise price, and a corresponding charge is included in merger and other reserves.
Any subsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is recognised within finance income or cost.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of theacquisition date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date.
Theseadjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 123 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, are expensed asincurred.
Method 2: All business combinations that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 wereaccounted for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2004.
Goodwill on those combinations represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and did not include the value of the non-controlling interest.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, were included in the cost of acquisition.
Method 3: For business combinations prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less accumulated amortisation up to 31 December 2003.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are those that are distinct and can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
Within ITV there are two types of other intangible assets: those assets directly purchased by the Group forday-to-day operational purposes such as software licences and development and intangible assets identified as part of an acquisition of a business.
Intangible assets acquired directly by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Those separately identified intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition or business combination are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation.
The main intangible assets the Group has valued are formats, brands, licences, contractual arrangements, customer contracts and relationships and libraries.
Each class of intangible assets valuation method on initial recognition, amortisation method and estimated useful life is set out in the table below: Class of intangible asset Valuation method Amortisation method Estimated useful life Formats and Applying a royalty rate to the expected future Straight-line 8 to 14 years brands revenue over the life of the brand.

124 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition requires judgement.
The Directors make estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows derived from exploiting the assets being acquired.
The Directors then estimate an appropriate discount rate to apply to the forecast cash flows.
Such estimates are based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates, operating costs and the expected useful lives of assets.
Judgements arealso made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be renewed: this drives our amortisation policy for those assets.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or businesses being acquired.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are judged to be indefinite.
Indefinite life assets, such as goodwill, are not amortised but are tested for impairment at each year end.
Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible assets has any indication of impairment requires judgement.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment test is performed by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill, thecash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units related to the goodwill.
Total assets which includes goodwill are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating unit or CGU.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value inuse is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset.
The Group applies cautious assumptions for impairment testing.
Estimates are used in deriving these cash flows and the discount rate.
Such estimates reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to theasset and the time value of money.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with long-term forecasting.
If different estimates of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were made, these changes could materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 125 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Intangible assets Intangible assets can be analysed as follows: Customer Formats contracts and Contractual Libraries Software Goodwill and brands relationships arrangements Licences and other licences and Total m m m m m m development m Cost At 1 January 2014 3,467 179 352 10 121 81 78 4,288 Additions 146 21 30 16 11 224 Foreign exchange 14 1 3 18 At 31 December 2014 3,627 201 385 10 121 97 89 4,530 Additions 102 273 23 1 15 414 Foreign exchange 15 7 3 1 26 At 31 December 2015 3,744 481 411 10 121 99 104 4,970 Amortisation and impairment At 1 January 2014 2,654 159 326 2 83 50 60 3,334 Charge for the year 18 21 3 7 7 11 67 At 31 December 2014 2,654 177 347 5 90 57 71 3,401 Charge for the year 27 17 2 4 8 9 67 Foreign exchange 1 1 2 At 31 December 2015 2,654 205 365 7 94 65 80 3,470 Net book value At 31 December 2015 1,090 276 46 3 27 34 24 1,500 At 31 December 2014 973 24 38 5 31 40 18 1,129 All intangible asset additions in the year, excluding software, are due to the acquisition of four production companies, as detailed in note 3.4 2014: three production companies acquired.
Goodwill impairment tests The carrying amount of Goodwill for each CGU is represented as follows: 2015 2014 m m Broadcast & Online 342 342 SDN 76 76 ITV Studios 672 555 1,090 973 There has been no impairment charge for any CGU during the year 2014: nil.
When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections: long-term growth rates: and a pre-tax market discountrate.
Cash flow projections are based on the Groups current five year plan.
Beyond the five year plan these projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate of 2% 2014: 2%.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long-term average growth rates for both the industry and the country in which they are located and is appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The discount rate has been revised for each CGU to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium and the net cost of debt.
There is currently no reasonably possible change in discount rate that would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.
126 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Broadcast & Online The goodwill in this CGU arose as a result of the acquisition of broadcasting businesses since 1999, the largest of which was the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc, which was treated as anacquisition of Carlton for accounting purposes.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow projections for this CGU are based include: the share of the television advertising market: share of commercial impacts: programme and other costs: andthe pre-tax market discount rate.
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of thetelevision advertising market.
In forming its assumptions about the television advertising market, theGroup has used a combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates, which place greater emphasis on recent experience.
Also as part of the impairment review, asensitivity of up to -15% was applied to 2016, again with no impairment identified.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 9.7% 2014: 10.6% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
SDN Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN the licence operator for DTT Multiplex A in 2005.
It represented the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the Group, principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and additional capacity available from 2010.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are: income to be earned from medium-term contracts: the market price of available multiplex video streams in the period up to andbeyond digital switchover: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of current contract terms, recent market transactions and in-house estimates of video stream availability and pricing.
As part of the impairment review sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified 2016: -5% growth, 2017: -10% growth.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the income and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.5% 2014: 12.6% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
ITV Studios The goodwill for ITV Studios has arisen as a result of the acquisition of production businesses since 1999.
Significant balances were created from the acquisition by Granada of United News and Medias production businesses in 2000 and the merger of Granada and Carlton in 2004 to form ITV plc.
ITV Studios goodwill also includes all of the goodwill arising from recent acquisitions in 2012 to 2015, with the largest acquisition addition to goodwill being Leftfield in 2014, followed by Talpa and Twofour in 2015.
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include revenue including international revenue and the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions and hours produced, margin growth and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house estimates of growth rates in all markets.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 10.1% 2014: 11.7% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Following the acquisitions made by ITV Studios in 2015, the Directors considered how assets and resources are shared across the Studios division and the level of integration within the management structure for thepurposes of reporting and strategic decision-making.
They concluded that a single ITV Studios CGU continues to remain appropriate.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 127 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued 3.4 Keeping it The following section outlines what the Group has acquired in the year.
simple Acquisitions All of the deals are structured so that a large part of the payment made to the sellers is determined based on future performance consideration.
This is done sothat the Group can both align incentives for growth, while reducing risk so that total consideration reflects actual performance, not expected.
IFRS accounting standards require some of this consideration to be included in thepurchase price used in determining goodwill contingent consideration.
Examples of contingent consideration include top-up payments and recoupable performance adjustments.
Any remaining consideration is required to be recognised as a liability or expense outside of acquisition accounting put option liabilities and employment-linked contingent payments known as earnout payments.
The Group considers the income statement impact of all consideration to be capital in nature and are therefore excluded from adjusted profit.
Therefore, for each acquisition below, the distinction between the types of consideration has been explained in detail.
Acquisitions During the period, the Group completed four acquisitions, all of which have been included in the results ofthe ITV Studios operating segment.
Each of the businesses fit with the strategy of growing the Groups content business and to work with other parts of the ITV Studios segment to exploit that content globally.
The following section provides asummary of the material acquisitions.
Talpa Media B. V. On 30 April 2015 the Group acquired 100% controlling interests in Talpa Media B. V. and its subsidiaries.
Talpa Media is the entertainment show producer behind The Voice, The Voice Kids, I Love My Country, Dating In The Dark and Dance Dance Dance.
The Group consolidates 100% of the earnings of the business.
Key terms: Cash consideration of 362 million 500 million was paid at acquisition and the maximum total consideration for 100% of the business, including the initial payment, is 796 million 1,100 million, undiscounted.
The deal structure allows for a further 434 million 600 million payable after two, five and eight years, on the achievement of stretching performance targets for the business in the years following acquisition.
For these amounts to be payable in the future, the deal requires the seller to remain with the business during the earnout period.
Further, if the seller leaves within the first two years following acquisition, asignificant portion of the initial consideration would be refunded to ITV.
Structuring the deal in this way helped manage risks in terms of initial capital outlay and created a joint incentive between ITV and the seller to grow the business, however IFRS requires any payment that links a seller to remaining in the business as an employment cost.
The Group considers these payments as capital in nature, and therefore expenses in relation to these payments are excluded from adjusted profits as an exceptional item.
Acquisition accounting: Intangibles, being the value placed on formats, brands, customer contracts, non-compete arrangements and libraries, of 276 million 382 million were identified and goodwill was valued at 41 million 57million.
Goodwill represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the content and formats produced by the Group.
The goodwill arising on acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Other fair value adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet, though noneof them are individually significant.
128 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Twofour Group On 24 June 2015 the Group acquired Boom Supervisory Limited, the holding company of Twofour Group.
Twofour Group owns 51% of Mainstreet Pictures.
Twofour Group is an independent production business with a range of scripted and unscripted programmes including The Jump, Educating Series Educating Essex, Educating Yorkshire, Hotel Inspector, Taking New York and Ibiza Weekender.
Key terms: The Group purchased the Twofour Group for a cash consideration of 55 million, subsequently the sellers subscribed to 25% of the share capital of the acquiring company.
A put and call option has been granted over this 25% in Twofour Group: these options both being exercisable over the next three to five years.
Thetransaction has been accounted for on an anticipated acquisition basis and a non-controlling interest has not been recognised.
The maximum total consideration for 100% of the business, including the initial payment, is 280 million undiscounted.
These payments are dependent on future performance of the business and linked to ongoing employment.
The Group considers these payments as capital in nature, andtherefore expenses in relation to these payments are excluded from adjusted profits as an exceptionalitem.
Provisional acquisition accounting: Intangibles, being the value placed on formats, brands, customer contracts, non-compete arrangements and libraries, of 18 million were identified and goodwill was valued at 50 million.
Goodwill represents thevalue placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the content and formats The Group is currently inthe process of completing the valuations for the net assets acquired with the businesses.
The Group expects to finalise the valuations of acquired assets and liabilities in the first half of 2016.
Other fair value adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet, though none ofthem are individually significant.
Other 2015 acquisitions The Group made an initial payment of 15 million for two smaller acquisitions, Cats on the Roof Media Ltd and Mammoth Screen Ltd, with a view that these acquisitions will strengthen and complement ITVs existing position as a producer for major television networks in the UK.
The maximum additional consideration that the Group could pay is 66million undiscounted.
Goodwill, which represents the value placed on the opportunity to grow the content produced by the Group, has been provisionally valued at 11 million.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions are not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisitions in 2014 Leftfield Entertainment was acquired for an initial consideration net of cash acquired of 214 million $360 million for 80% of the membership interests in May 2014.
The remaining 20% equity interest wasacquired in December 2015.
In consideration for the acquisition of the minority interest the Group assumed certain obligations of the seller, most notably earnout arrangements for its subsidiaries.
Noadditional cash consideration was payable to the seller as a result of the purchase of the remaining minority interest.
The total maximum additional consideration payable by ITV for the acquisition of 100% of the membership interest of Leftfield Entertainment, including the additional assumed earnout obligations, is 65 million $100 million and is dependent on future performance and is linked to ongoing employment.
Intangible assets of 65 million $109 million were identified in 2014, being the value placed on brands, customer contracts, non-compete arrangements and libraries.
The Group also acquired 51% of the membership interest in DiGa Vision, a US-based producer and 100% of the controlling interest in United Productions, a company based in Denmark.
The total initial consideration net of cash acquired was 5million and the maximum additional amount payable is 32 million undiscounted.
The final payout is dependent on future performance and is linked to ongoing employment.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 129 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Intangibles of 2 million were identified, largely reflecting the value placed on brands, customer contracts and contractual arrangements.

Cash acquired during the year comprises Talpa 22 million, Twofour 6 million and Other 5 million.
Note B: Total consideration is net of employment linked consideration of 109 million.
IFRS 3 R requires the employment linked consideration to be treated as remuneration.
This amount is repayable to the Group should the seller terminate the service agreement within the first two years following completion.
The remaining balance is shown within trade and other receivables and is expensed over two years.
Note C: Non-controlling interest arises where the Group acquires less than 100% of the equity interest in a business, but obtains control.
Note D: This represents the present value of earnouts as at acquisition.
Note E: Adjusting for exceptional costs relating to employment linked consideration reduces the contribution to the Groups profit aftertax for the period from the date of acquisition to a loss of 35 million for Talpa, a profit of 1 million for Twofour and nil on otheracquisitions.
Note F: Adjusting for exceptional costs relating to employment linked consideration reduces the contribution to the Groups profit aftertax on a full year proforma basis to a loss of 38 million for Talpa, a profit of 1 million for Twofour and a loss of 1 million on otheracquisitions.
130 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 3.5 Keeping it The Group holds non-controlling interests in a number of different entities.
simple Accounting for these investments, and the Groups share of any profits and losses, Investments depends on the level of control or influence the Group is granted via its interest.
The three principal types of non-consolidated investments are: joint arrangements joint ventures or joint operations, associates and available for sale investments.
A joint venture is an investment where the Group has joint control, with one or more third parties.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence i. e. power to participate in the investees financial and operating decisions.
Any other investment is an available for sale investment.
Accounting policies For joint ventures and associates the Group applies equity accounting.
Under this method, it recognises the investment in the entity at cost and subsequently adjusts this for its share of profits or losses, which are recognised in the income statement within non-operating items and included in adjusted profit.
Available for sale investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.
The carrying value of all investments are shown as non-current assets on the Statement of Financial Position.
The 16 million increase in the year comprises 14 million in relation to the acquisition of associates and available for sale investments and 2 million of funding to existing joint ventures.
Please refer to page 170 for the list of principal investments held at 31 December 2015.
3.6 Keeping it A provision is recognised by the Group where an obligation exists relating to simple events in the past and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it.
Provisions A provision is made where the Group is not certain how much cash will be required to settle a liability, so an estimate is required.
The main estimates relate to the cost of holding properties that are no longer in use by the Group, the likelihood of settling legal claims and contracts the Group has entered into that are now unprofitable.
Accounting policies A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events, it is probable cash will be paid to settle it and the amount can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a financing cost in the income statement.
The value of the provision is determined based on assumptions and estimates in relation to the amount and timing of actual cash flows which are dependent on future events.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 131 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Provisions The movements in provisions during the year are as follows: Contract Property Legal and Other provisions provisions provisions Total m m m m At 1 January 2015 3 3 15 21 Additions 5 10 15 Utilised 2 2 Released 1 1 At 31 December 2015 6 2 25 33 Provisions of 28 million are classified as current liabilities 2014: 17 million.
Unwind of the discount is nil in 2015 and 2014.
Contract provisions comprise onerous commitments on transmission infrastructure that are expected to be utilised over the remaining contract period and onerous technology services contracts which will not beutilised.
Legal and Other provisions totalling 25 million 2014: 15 million primarily relate to potential liabilities that may arise as a result of Boxclever having been placed into administrative receivership, most of which relate to pension arrangements.
In 2011 the Determinations Panel of the Pensions Regulator determined that Financial Support Directions FSDs should be issued against certain Group companies, which would require the Group to put in place financial support for the Boxclever Scheme.
The Group is challenging this in the Upper Tribunal.
The reference process is ongoing and aside from procedural issues there were no substantive case developments in the period.
The Directors have obtained leading counsels opinion and extensive legal advice in connection with the proceedings and continue to believe that the provision held isappropriate.
The increase in provisions during the year was primarily due to anticipated costs of settling other legal matters.
132 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 3.7 Keeping it In this note we explain the accounting policies governing the Groups pension simple scheme, followed by analysis of the components of the net defined benefit Pensions pension deficit, including assumptions made, and where the related movements have been recognised in the financial statements.
In addition, we have placed text boxes to explain some of the technical terms used in the disclosure.
What are the Groups pension schemes?
There are two types of pension schemes.
A Defined Contribution scheme that isopen to ITV employees, and a number of Defined Benefit schemes that have been closed to new members since 2006.
What is a Defined Contribution scheme?
The Defined Contribution scheme is where the Group makes fixed payments into a separate fund on behalf of those employees that have elected to participate insaving for their retirement.
ITV has no further obligation to the participating employee and the risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the Group.
It is the members responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
What is a Defined Benefit scheme?
In a Defined Benefit scheme, members receive cash payments during retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service.
The Group manages the necessary investment, mortality and inflation risks in order to meet these obligations.
In the event of poor returns the Group needs toaddress this through a combination of increased levels of contribution orby making adjustments to the scheme.
Schemes can be funded, where regular cashcontributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments.
The Group makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial position.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets ofthe Scheme and its funding position.
The Trustee, appointed according to the terms of the Schemes documentation, is required to act in the best interest of the members and is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the scheme and its funding position.
Accounting policies Defined contribution scheme Obligations under the Groups defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
For 2015, total contributions expensed were 16 million 2014: 14 million.
Defined benefit scheme The Groups obligation in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme the Scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future retirement benefit that eligible employees members have earned in return for their services.
That benefit payable in the future is discounted to todays value and then the fair value of scheme assets contributed by the Group is deducted to measure the net pension deficit.
The liabilities of the Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paidusing the projected unit method.
This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowance for projected earnings of members in the future up to retirement.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 133 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued These calculations are complex and are performed by a qualified actuary.
There are many judgements and estimates necessary to calculate the Groups estimated liabilities, the main assumptions are set out later in this section.
Movements in assumptions during the year are called actuarial gains and losses and these are recognised in the period in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive income.
The latest triennial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2014 by an independent actuary appointed by the Trustee of the Scheme and agreed in early 2016.
The next triennial valuation will be asat 1 January 2017 and is expected to be agreed in 2018.
This will drive subsequent contribution rates.
An unfunded scheme in relation to previous Directors is accounted for under IAS 19 and the Group is responsible for meeting the pension obligations as they fall due.
It is securitised by assets held outside of the ITV Pension Scheme in the form of gilts and included within cash and cash equivalents see note 4.1.
The defined benefit pension deficit The net pension deficit at 31 December 2015 was 176 million 2014: 346 million.
The net assets and liabilities of the Scheme are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position and shown within non-current liabilities.
The totals recognised in the current and previous yearsare: 2015 2014 m m Total defined benefit scheme obligations 3,446 3,687 Total defined benefit scheme assets 3,270 3,341 Net pension deficit 176 346 The remaining sections provide further detail of the value of the Schemes assets and liabilities, how these are accounted for and the impact on the income statement.
Defined benefit scheme obligations Keeping it What cause movements in the defined benefit pension obligations?
simple The areas that impact the defined benefit obligation the pension scheme liabilities position at the year end are as follows: Current service cost the cost to the Group of the future benefits earned bymembers that relates to the members service in the current year.
This is charged to operating costs in the income statement.
Interest cost the pension obligations payable in the future are discounted tothe present value at year end.
A discount factor is used to determine the current value today of the future cost.
The interest cost is the unwinding of oneyears movement in the present value of the obligation.
It is broadly determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by the updated present value of the obligation during the period.
The discount rateis a key assumption explained later in this section.
This interest cost is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement see note 4.4.
Actuarial gains or losses there are broadly two causes of actuarial movements.
Experience adjustments, which arise when comparing assumptions made when estimating the liabilities and what has actually occurred, and adjustments resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions e. g. movements in corporate bond yields.
Key assumptions are explained in detail later in this section.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised through othercomprehensive income.
Benefits paid any cash benefits paid out by the Scheme will reduce theobligation.

Assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations Keeping it What are the main assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations?
simple The main assumptions are: future salary levels future pensionable salary levels an estimate of increases in pension payments the life expectancy of members the effect of inflation on all these factors the discount rate used to estimate the present day fair value of these obligations How do we determine the appropriate assumptions?
The Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to the appropriateness ofthe assumptions used.
IFRS requires that we estimate a discount rate by reference to high quality fixedincome investments in the UK that match the estimated term of the pensionobligations.
The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used as a basis for the remaining financial assumptions, except where caps have been implemented.
The discount rate has therefore been obtained using the yields available on AA rated corporate bonds which match projected cash flows.
The Groups estimate ofthe weighted average term of the liabilities is 15 years 2014: 15 years.
The principal assumptions used in the Schemes valuations at the year end were: 2015 2014 Discount rate for: Past service liabilities 3.80% 3.50% Future service liabilities 4.00% 3.70% Inflation assumption for: Past service liabilities 3.00% 3.00% Future service liabilities 3.10% 3.05% Rate of pensionable salary increases 0.90% 0.90% 1 Rate of increase in pension payment LPI 5% pension increases 2.90% 2.90% Rate of increase to deferred pensions CPI 2.00% 2.00% 1.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 135 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued The table below reflects published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the results of investigations into the mortality experience of Scheme members.
The assumed life expectations on retirement are: 2015 2015 2014 2014 Retiring today at age 60 65 60 65 Males 28.0 23.2 27.9 23.1 Females 30.6 25.7 30.5 25.6 Retiring in 20 years at age 60 65 60 65 Males 30.0 25.0 29.9 24.9 Females 32.6 27.6 32.5 27.5 Keeping it Which assumptions have the biggest impact on estimating the Scheme simple liabilities?
It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions usedmay have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position.
This sensitivity to change is analysed below to demonstrate how small changes in assumptions can have a large impact on the estimation of the Schemes liabilities.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligation are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 50 million 55 million Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 15 million 15 million Retail Price Index Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 10 million 10 million Consumer Price Index Life expectations Increase by one year Increase by 90 million The analysis above considers the impact of the single change in the assumption while keeping the other assumptions unchanged, except for inflation.
The inflation sensitivities allow for consequential changes toall pension increases linked to the relevant index.
The sensitivity analyses have been determined byextrapolating the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the year end with changes in key assumptions that might reasonably occur.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of Scheme assets, which may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis for the impact of life expectations on the defined benefit liability does not include the potential offsetting benefit of the longevity swap classified as a Scheme asset.
It is estimated that a 75 million benefit would arise on the value of the longevity swap from a one year increase in the marketbased assumption of mortality.
Please refer to the Keeping it simple box in the following section for further information on the longevity swap.
136 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Total defined benefit scheme assets Keeping it The Scheme holds assets across a number of different classes which are simple managed by the Trustee, who consults with the Group on changes to its investment policy.
What are the pension Scheme assets?
At 31 December 2015 the Schemes assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities.
The tables below set out the major categories of assets.
Financial instruments are in place in order to provide protection against changes in market factors interest rates and inflation which could act to increase the net pension deficit.
These financial instruments are classified as Scheme assets.
One such instrument is the longevity swap which the Scheme transacted in 2011 to obtain protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of pensioner members at that date.
Under the swap, the Trustee agreed to make pre-determined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live.
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in the Scheme assets.
The swap had a nil valuation at inception and, using market-based assumptions, is subsequently adjusted for changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates.
How do we measure the pension Scheme assets?
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following: Interest income on scheme assets this is determined by multiplying the fair value of the Scheme assets by the discount rate, both taken as of the beginning of the year.
This is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement.
Return on assets arise from differences between the actual return and interest income on Scheme assets and are recognised through other comprehensive income.
Employers contributions are paid into the Scheme to be managed and invested.
Benefits and administrative expenses paid out by the Schemes will lower the fair value of the Schemes assets The movement in the fair value of the defined benefit schemes assets is analysed below: 2015 2014 m m Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 3,341 2,870 Interest income on Scheme assets 116 128 Loss return on assets, excluding interest income 126 390 Employer contributions 102 103 Benefits paid 158 145 Administrative expenses paid 5 5 Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 3,270 3,341 The actual return on the Schemes assets, being the sum of the interest income on Scheme assets and return on Scheme assets, for the year ended 31 December 2015 was a decrease of 10 million 2014:increase of 518 million.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 137 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued How are the Schemes assets invested?

When selecting the mix of assets to hold, and considering their related risks and returns, the Trustee will weigh up the variability of returns against the target long-term rate of return on the overall portfolio.
Keeping it What was the impact of movements on the Schemes assets and liabilities?
simple The sections above describe how the Scheme obligations and assets are comprised and measured.
The following section sets out the impact of various movements and expenses on the Scheme on the Groups financial statement.
Amounts recognised through the income statement Amounts recognised through the income statement are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Amount charged to operating costs: Current service cost 8 7 Scheme administration expenses 5 5 13 12 Amount charged to net financing costs: Net interest on defined benefit obligation 10 16 Total charged in the consolidated income statement 23 28 138 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Amounts recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income The amounts recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income cost are: 2015 2014 m m Remeasurement gains and losses : Loss Return on scheme assets excluding interest income 126 390 Actuarial gains losses on liabilities arising from change in: inflation experience 48 financial assumptions 169 402 updated valuation data 36 217 366 Total recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 91 24 The 217 million actuarial gain on the Schemes liabilities was principally due to an increase in bond yields over the year, which has resulted in a decrease in the liabilities.
The 126 million loss on the Schemes assetsprimarily results from decreases in the market values of gilts and swaps, which has led to assets underperforming expectations.
Addressing the net pension deficit Keeping it The Group works closely with the Trustee to agree appropriate levels of funding simple for the Scheme.
This involves agreeing a Schedule of Contributions at each triennial valuation, which specifies the contribution rates for the employer and scheme members and the date these contributions are due.
A recovery plan setting out the steps that will be taken to address a funding shortfall is also agreed.
In the event that the Groups defined benefit scheme is in a net liability position, the Directors must take steps to manage the size of the deficit.
Apart from the funding agreements mentioned above, this could involve pledging additional assets to the Scheme, as was the case in the SDN and London Television Centre LTVC pension funding partnerships explained below.
The levels of ongoing contributions to the Scheme are based on the current service costs as assessed by the Scheme Trustee and the expected future cash flows of the Scheme.
Normal employer contributions in2016 for current service are expected to be in the region of 12 million 2015: 11 million and deficit funding contributions in 2016 are expected to be 66 million 2015: 76 million, assuming current contribution rates continue as agreed with the Trustee.
Under the SDN pension partnership, set up in 2010, the Group has agreed to make payments of 11million for 12 years from 2011.
The LTVC partnership, established in March 2014, commits the Group to an annual payment of 2 million in 2016, increasing by 5% per annum until 2038.
IFRIC 14 clarifies how the asset ceiling should be applied, in particular, how local minimum funding rules work.
The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets if the Schemes are run off until the last member dies, on which basis IFRIC 14 does not cause any change in the balance sheet disclosures before tax.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 139 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs In this section This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related financing costs, including its balance sheet liquidity and access to capital markets.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically, how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet efficiency remains important to the Group, as seen through the issuance of anew Eurobond during the year.
Any potential courses of action will take into account the Groups liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.
A Tax and Treasury committee acting under delegated authority from the Board, approves certain financial transactions and monitors compliance with the Groups tax and treasury policies.
4.1 Keeping it Net cash debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total cash resources simple net of the current outstanding debt.
Net cash debt Adjusted net debt is also monitored by the Group and more closely reflects how credit agencies see the Groups gearing.
To arrive at the adjusted net debt amount, we add our total undiscounted expected contingent payments on acquisitions, ourIAS 19 pensiondeficit and our undiscounted operating lease commitments.

Legal action has commenced to try and remove thecharge.
Loans and facilities due within one year In October 2015 the unsecured 78 million Eurobond matured, resulting in a net payment by the Group of76 million, after settlement of the Groups related outstanding interest rate swaps.
At various periods during the year the Group drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility RCF to meet short-term funding requirements.
All short-term drawings were repaid by the end of the year.
The maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was 500 million 362 million in April to fund the acquisition of Talpa Media.
The maximum draw down on the RCF during 2014 was 321 million to fund the2014 acquisitions.
Loans and loan notes due after one year In September 2015 the Group issued a seven year 600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125% which will mature in September 2022.
The bond refinanced the 12 month bridge loan facility of 500 million that was used to repay the RCF, which initially funded the purchase of Talpa Media in April.
The Group also has an unsecured 161 million Eurobond which matures in January 2017 and has a coupon of 6.125%.

The interest payable on these Borrowings instruments is shown in the net financing costs note in note 4.4. and finance There are Board-approved policies in place to manage the Groups financial risks.
leases Macroeconomic market risks, which impact currency transactions and interest rates, are discussed in note 4.3. Credit and liquidity risks are discussed below.
Credit risk: the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations and Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due The Group is required to disclose the fair value of its debt instruments.
The fair value is the amount the Group would pay a third party to transfer the liability.
It is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
This calculation offair value is consistent with instruments valued under level 2 in note 4.5.
Accounting policies Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Under the amortised cost method the difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the income statement over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest basis.
Finance leases Historically, ITV has entered into sale and leaseback agreements in relation to certain programme titles.
Related outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise the principal and accrued interest, areincluded within borrowings.
The finance related element of the agreement is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on an effective interest basis.
Sale and leaseback obligations are secured against an equivalent cash balance held within cash and cash equivalents.
Managing credit and liquidity risk Credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of derivative financial assets see note 4.3, trade receivables see note 3.1.
4, and cash and cash equivalents note 4.1.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The majority of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers.
Credit insurance has been taken out against these companies to minimise the impact on the Group in the event of a possible default.
Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash that emphasise preservation of capital.
The guidelines set out procedures and limits on counterparty risk and maturity profile of cash placed.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies and perceived state support.
Deposits longer than 12 months require the approval of the Board.
142 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Borrowings ITV is rated as investment grade by Moodys and S&P.
ITVs credit ratings, the cost of credit default swap hedging and the absolute level of interest rates are key determinants in the cost of new borrowings for ITV.
Liquidity risk The Groups financing policy is to fund itself for the medium to long-term by using debt instruments with arange of maturities and to ensure access to appropriate short-term bank facilities with a minimum of 250million of undrawn facilities available at all times.
Long-term funding comes from the UK and European Capital markets, while any short to medium-term debt requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling 775 million see below.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve comprising undrawn bank facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This monitoring includes financial ratios to assess possible future credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the accessibility of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group has available funds through a Revolving Credit Facility RCF with a group of relationship banks.
This 525 million facility is committed with leverage and interest cover financial covenants and matures in2019.
In addition, the Group has 250 million of financial covenant free financing which runs forthree toseven years.
All of these facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2015 2014: no drawings.

simple A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.
Managing Aderivatives value changes over time in response to underlying variables such market risks: asexchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period.
Ahedge derivative iswhere a derivative is used to manage exposure in an underlying variable.
financial The Group is exposed to certain market risks.
In accordance with Board approved instruments policies, which are set out in this note, the Group manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the underlying exposures.
The key market risks facing the Group are: Currency risk arising from: i. t ranslation risk, that is, the risk in the period of adverse currency fluctuations inthe translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities balance sheet risk and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities income statement risk and ii.
t ransaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups non-functional currency trading cash flows.
A non-functional currency transaction is a transaction in any currency other than the reporting currency of the subsidiary.
Interest rate risk to the Group arises from significant changes in interest rates onborrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates.
The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency and interest rate risk: Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement translation risk arising from short term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date and Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate, or vice versa, or one type of floating rate for another, and are used to manage interest rate risk Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section.
Accounting policies Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured atfair value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss islater reclassified to the income statement in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
144 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements Determining Fair Value The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap atthe reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our current creditworthiness, as well asthat of our swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
How do we manage our currency and interest rate risk?
Currency risk As the Group expands its international operations, the performance of the business becomes increasingly sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue at the time of commitment for up to five years forward.
The Group also hedges a proportion of highly probable non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue on a rolling 18 month basis see Keeping it simple box for explanation of non-functional currency transactions.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency denominated cash balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps both to manage foreign currency cash flow timing differences and to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary items.
The Groups net investments in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to be material.
In 2015 the Group designated a portion of its euro borrowings into a net investment hedge against its euro denominated assets following the acquisition of Talpa Media.
The following table highlights the Groups sensitivity to translation risk resulting from a 10% strengthening weakening in sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables are heldconstant: 2015 post- 2014 posttax profit 2015 equity tax profit 2014 equity US dollar 10 million 63 million 8 million 34 million Euro 8 million 41 million 8 million 29 million Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate policy is to allow fixed rate gross debt to vary between 20% and 100% of total gross debt to accommodate floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
At 31 December 2015 the Groups fixed rate debt represented 99% of total gross debt 2014: 100%.
Consequently a 1% movement in interest rates on negligible floating variable rate debt would not impact the post-tax profit for the year.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the movements in the year relating to changes in fair value and interest are not separated.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 145 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs continued What is the value of our derivative financial instruments?
The following table shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments analysed by type of contract.
Interest rate swap fair values exclude accrued interest.
Assets Liabilities At 31 December 2015 m m Current Cash flow hedges 4 Foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps fair value through profit or loss 1 1 Interest rate swaps fair value through profit or loss Non-current Interest rate swaps fair value through profit or loss 8 6 9 11 Assets Liabilities At 31 December 2014 m m Current Cash flow hedges 3 Interest rate swaps fair value through profit or loss 11 9 Non-current Cash flow hedges 1 Interest rate swaps fair value through profit or loss 16 11 27 24 Interest rate swaps On issuing the 2017 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfolio of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and then subsequently overlaid a portfolio of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with the result that interest was 100% fixed on these borrowings.
The timing of entering into these swaps locked in an interest benefit for the Group, resulting in a net mark-to-market gain on the portfolio.
Cash flow hedges The Group applies hedge accounting for certain foreign currency firm commitments and highly probably cash flows where the underlying cash flows are payable within the next two years.
In order to fix the sterling cash outflows associated with the commitments which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts for the same foreign currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the revaluation loss associated with these contracts.
There was less than 1 million 2014: nil ineffectiveness taken to the income statement and 6million cumulative loss 2014: nil recycled to the income statement in the year.
Net investment hedges The Group uses euro denominated debt to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its euro denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 141 million 2014: nil.
A foreign exchange loss of 2 million 2014: nil relating tothe net investment hedges has been netted off within exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

costs In reporting adjusted profit, the Group adjusts net financing costs to exclude unrealised mark-to-market movements on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, gains losses on bond buybacks, net pension interest, interest and fair value movements in acquisition-related liabilities and other financing costs.
Our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs is set out in the Financial and Performance Review.
Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds invested, gains losses on the disposal of financial instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance leases, unwinding of the discount on provisions, unwinding of the discount on liabilities to non-controlling interest, foreign exchange gains losses, and imputed interest on pension assets and liabilities.
Interest income and expense is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Net financing costs Net financing costs can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Financing income: Interest income 3 4 Change in fair value of instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss 3 Foreign exchange gain 1 Other finance income 17 6 22 Financing costs: Interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 17 19 Net pension interest see note 3.7 10 17 Losses on early settlement 30 Foreign exchange loss 2 Other finance expense 8 7 37 73 Net financing costs 31 51 Interest on financial liabilities relates to the interest incurred on the Groups borrowings in the year.
The losses on early settlement in the prior year of 30 million were incurred as a result of the repurchase ofthe remaining 62 million 2019 bilateral loan.
Other finance income in the prior year primarily relates to acquisition-related contingent liabilities.
This is where estimates of the future performance against stretch targets is reassessed, resulting in adjustments to the related put option liabilities.
Other finance expense includes the amortisation of facility commitment and upfront fees.
148 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Financial Statements 4.5 Keeping it The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position are simple measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair Fair value valuecan in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the hierarchy calculations.
ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
Level 1 Fair values are measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Fair values are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date.
Level 3 Fair values are measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based onobservable market data.
The tables below set out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position atfair value.
Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2015 2015 2015 2015 m m m m Assets measured at fair value Available for sale financial instruments Available for sale gilts see note 4.1 38 38 Available for sale investments see note 3.5 11 11 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps 1 1 Interest rate swaps 8 8 58 38 9 11 Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2015 2015 2015 2015 m m m m Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Contingent consideration 3 3 Foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps 1 1 Interest rate swaps 6 6 Financial liabilities at fair value through reserves Cash flow hedges 4 4 14 11 3 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 149 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs continued Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2014 2014 2014 2014 m m m m Assets measured at fair value Available for sale financial instruments Available for sale gilts see note 4.1 39 39 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Contingent consideration 32 32 Interest rate swaps 27 27 98 39 27 32 Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2014 2014 2014 2014 m m m m Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Contingent consideration 3 3 Interest rate swaps 20 20 Financial liabilities at fair value through reserves Cash flow hedges 4 4 27 24 3 Refer to note 4.3 for how we value interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Contingent consideration is the Groups only financial instrument classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
As noted in the accounting policy section of note 3.3, the key assumptions taken into consideration when measuring this acquisition-related liability are the performance expectations of the acquisition and a discount rate that reflects the size and nature of the new business.
There is no reasonable change in discount rate or performance targets that would give rise to a material change in the liability at year end.
The table below summarises the key movement in the contingent consideration during the year.

4.7 Keeping it The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration simple packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation Share-based schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award DSA, Performance Share Plan PSP, compensation Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Save As You Earn SAYE schemes.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Group receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
If the Group incurs a liability based on the price or value of the Groups shares then this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that existed at any time during the period are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Accounting policies For each of the Groups share-based compensation schemes, the fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions.
For performance-based schemes, the relevant Group performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to present value.
The Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, are recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment toequity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA.
During the year allexercises were satisfied by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees BenefitTrust.
Share-based compensation charges totalled 14 million in 2015 2014: 14 million.
