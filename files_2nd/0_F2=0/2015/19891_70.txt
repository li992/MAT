CAPITAL AND FUNDING ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
INTERNAL HOLDINGS The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2,400 inclusive in NV Special Shares and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N. V. Elma a subsidiary of NV and one half by United Holdings Limited a subsidiary of PLC.
This capital is eliminated on consolidation.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC.
Full details of these plans are given in note 4C on pages 104 and 105.
OTHER RESERVES Other reserves include the fair value reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, the capital redemption reserve and treasurystock.
SHARES HELD BY EMPLOYEE SHARE TRUSTS AND GROUP COMPANIES Certain PLC trusts, NV and group companies purchase and hold NV and PLC shares to satisfy performance shares granted, share options granted and other share awards see note 4C.
The assets and liabilities of these trusts and shares held by group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements.
The book value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and trusts borrowings are included in the Groups liabilities.
The costs of the trusts are included in the results of the Group.
These shares are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs.
Certain bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship.
In these cases, the bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in profit and loss.
Other financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are subsequently carried at amortised cost.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING CONTINUED Unilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital: total equity retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests notes 15A and 15B : short-term debt current financial liabilities note 15C : and long-term debt non-current bank loans, bonds and other loans note 15C.
The Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group is based on managements judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs.
We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Our current long-term credit rating is A A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1 P1.
We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of A A1 in the long term.
This provides us with: appropriate access to the debt and equity markets: sufficient flexibility for acquisitions: sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity: and optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.
Unilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.
This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.
Unilever will take appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, its capital structure.
Unilever is not subject to financial covenants in any of its significant financing agreements.
