11 Financial risk management The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest and liquidity, which arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty.

Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the Fidessa group.
