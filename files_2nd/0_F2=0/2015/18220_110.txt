Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk The Groups overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets outguidelines to manage financial risk Regular reports are received from all operating companies to enable prompt identification offinancial risks so that appropriate action may be taken In the management and definition of capital the Group includes ordinary andpreference share capital and net debt Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect tothe US Dollar and the Euro Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities andnet investments inforeign operations Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities The Groups risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed toforeign currency translation risk Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so For 2015, had the Groups basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker stronger than the actual rates experienced, post tax profitfor the year would have been 128m 2014: 111m lower higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profitsof the Groups overseas entities, and equity would have been 72m 2014: 268m lower higher Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of its gross borrowings atfloating interest rates and at 31 December 2015 over 75% of Group borrowings were at floating rates During 2010, to provide ahedge against the Groups floating rate debt, the Group issued a ten year fixed rate $100m loan note The loan note is repayable in2020 and carries a fixed rate of594% As at 31 December 2015, aside from the US$100m loan note, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months ofthe balance sheet date At 31 December 2015, the Groups fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 594% 2014: 594% The Groups floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents Based on the above, had interest rates moved by 10 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post tax profits would have moved by 02m 2014: 02m due to increased interest expense on the Groups floating rate borrowings Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term committed facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments The Group also has a share buyback programme that is managed to ensure the efficiency of the Groups funding structure On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Groups cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain thecase forthe foreseeable future Croda International Plc 116 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality  The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to providereturns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overallcost ofcapital In order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital toshareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt Given the Groups strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, theGroup announced a new dividend policy in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings Furtherdetails can be found in the Chairmans Statement on pages 4 and 5 Underlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital ROIC is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group Theacquisition of Uniqema in 2006 reduced the ROIC, but also reduced Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC since the deal waspredominantly financed through debt The Groups ROIC now stands at 214% against a post-tax WACC of 58%, thus hitting the Groups target of maintaining ROIC at a higher level than the WACC In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure our ability to service our debt Both net debt EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2015 Further details can befound in the Group Finance Directors Report on pages 26 to 29 The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year
