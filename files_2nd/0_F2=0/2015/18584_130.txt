NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 24 Post-employment obligations 2015 2014 Post-employment obligations as at the year end comprise: m m Pensions funded 977 1,067 unfunded 505 564 Medical funded 30 28 unfunded 46 52 1,558 1,711 The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In addition, in the US and UK various plans operate which provide members with post-retirement medical benefits.
The Groups postemployment plans in the UK, US and Germany together account for 98% of plan assets and 98% of plan liabilities.
The Groups post-employment plans include both funded and unfunded arrangements.
The UK pension schemes are funded, albeit in deficit in common with many other UK pension schemes, with the scheme assets held in trustee administered funds.
The German and other European plans are generally unfunded, with pension payments made from company funds as they fall due, rather than from scheme assets.
The US includes a combination of funded and unfunded pension and medical plans, while Japan also operates a funded pension plan.
The Groups defined benefit pension arrangements provide benefits to members in the form of an assured level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided typically depends on length of service and salary levels in the years leading up to retirement.
In the UK and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with inflation, whereas in the US pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
The UK and German schemes are closed to new entrants, while the US schemes are closed to future accrual.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2015.
Thepresent value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service cost elements were measured using the projected unit creditmethod.
a Defined benefit schemes significant judgements, assumptions and estimates Key assumptions: UK GKN1 GKN2 Americas Europe ROW % % % % % 2015 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past future service n a 4.10 4.15 n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.05 3.10 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past future service 3.55 3.85 4.05 4.30 2.40 0.80 Inflation assumption past future service 3.05 3.10 3.15 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long term 5.4 5.4 7.0 5.0 n a n a 2014 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past future service n a 4.05 4.10 n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.05 3.05 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past future service 3.25 3.55 3.80 3.90 1.90 0.80 Inflation assumption past future service 3.05 3.05 3.10 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long term 5.5 5.5 7.0 5.0 n a n a The assumptions table above specifies separate assumptions for past and future service in relation to the UK pension scheme.
This approach is consistent with that taken in 2014, whereby a different, future service set of assumptions will be used to determine the service cost for the following year.
This reflects evolving market practice and is based on the premise that active members of the scheme are younger and have, on average, longer remaining life expectancy than an average scheme member.
Given that yield curves typically rise over time, this longer duration implies a higher discount rate for the active sub-set of members which has been set at 4.05%, as at 31 December 2015.
GKN plc 150 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The UK schemes each use a duration specic discount rate derived from the Mercer pension discount yield curve, which is based on corporate bonds with two or more AA-ratings.
The European discount rate was calculated with reference to Aon Hewitts German discount rate yield curve.
For the USA, the discount rate referenced the Citigroup intermediate pension liability index, the Merrill Lynch US corporate AA 10 years index and the Towers Watson Rate:LINK benchmark.
The approach taken in each territory is consistent with prior year.
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes, are as follows: United Kingdom The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN1 and GKN2 use S1NA year of birth mortality tables adjusted for GKN experience with CMI 2013 improvements and a 1.25% p. a. long term improvement trend.
These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN1 a male aged 65 lives for a further 21.8 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 23.9 years while a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 23.6 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 25.8 years from age 65.
For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.8 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.2 years while a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 24.7 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 27.1 years from age 65.
Overseas In the US, RP-2014 tables have been used while in Germany the RT2005-G tables have been used.
In the US, the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 21.2 years female 23.2 years while in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.6 years female 22.8 years.
The longevity assumption for a US male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 22.9 years once attaining 65 years female 24.9 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.5 years female 25.5 years.
These assumptions are based on the prescribed tables, rather than GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions longevity: 1 year on the dened benefit obligations as at 31 December 2015 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities m m m m Discount rate % Discount rate -% Rate of inflation % Rate of inflation -% Life expectancy year Life expectancy - year Health cost trend % Health cost trend -% The above sensitivity analyses are based on isolated changes in each assumption, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and there is likely to be some level of correlation between movements in dierent assumptions.
In addition, these sensitivities relate only to potential movement in the dened benefit obligations.
The assets, including derivatives held by the schemes, have been designed to mitigate the impact of these movements to some extent, such that the movements in the dened benefit obligations shown above would, in practice be partly oset by movements in asset valuations.
However, the above sensitivities are shown to illustrate at a high level the scale of sensitivity of the dened benefit obligations to key actuarial assumptions.
The same actuarial methods have been used to calculate these sensitivities as are used to calculate the relevant balance sheet values, and have not changed compared to the previous period.
Judgements and estimates Buy-in During the year, a second bulk annuity pensioner buy-in was transacted in relation to the UK pension scheme, GKN 1, as a result of which an increased proportion of GKN 1 liabilities are now fully insured.
The transaction involved a payment to Rothesay Life of 53 million, made from GKN 1s assets in addition to a refund due from the previous policy following the pension increase exchange exercise see below.
The additional bulk annuity covers 47 million of pensioner liabilities valued on an IAS 19 accounting basis, as at 31 December 2015.

Pension increase exchange A pension increase exchange was completed in the UK scheme, GKN 1, during 2015.
This involved pensioners being offered a no obligation opportunity to exchange future inflationary increases to their pensions in return for a one-off rise with no future increases.
Due to differences in the inflation assumptions between those used to determine the offer and those used for accounting purposes, the increase has led to a past service credit in the income statement of 7 million.
This was partially offset by a past service cost of 1 million in the GKN 2 scheme in respect of early retirement funding for a small number of members.

At the date of the last valuation on 5 April 2013 the Groups UK pension funding deficit was lower than the equivalent UK accounting deficit.
Additional UK deficit recovery payments of 10 million per year commenced in 2014 and the potential for further additional payments commences in 2016, contingent upon asset performance.
In addition the Group has an obligation to pay 2 million per year until 2017 to UK scheme, GKN1, to cover a funding requirement arising from the 123 million bulk annuity purchase transacted in 2014.
The combined contribution for deficit funding and future accrual expected to be paid by the Group during 2016 to the UK schemes is 44million.
In addition, a distribution of 30 million is expected to be made from the UK pension partnership to the UK schemes in the first half of 2016, which brings the total expected UK cash requirement for 2016 to 74 million.
The expected 2016 contribution to overseas schemes is 26million.

c Defined benefit scheme risk factors Through its various post-employment pension and medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The Groups focus is on managing the cash demands which the various pension plans place on the Group, rather than balance sheet volatility in its own right.
For funded schemes cash requirements are generally determined by funding valuations which are performed on a different basis from accounting valuations.
Asset volatility: Plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields although the discount rate methodology differs for accounting and funding purposes.
If plan assets deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate, this will create or increase a plan deficit.
GKNs various pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, albeit at the risk of short-term volatility.
As the plans mature, with a shorter time horizon to cope with volatility, the Group will gradually reduce holdings of growth assets in favour of increased matching assets bonds and similar.
In the meantime, the Group considers that equities and similar assets are an appropriate means of managing pension funding requirements, given the long term nature of the liabilities and the strength of the Group to withstand volatility.
