Current capital employed Current capital employed is current assets less accounts payable, current deferred income, current provisions, current other financial liabilities and income tax payable.
Funds from operations FFO FFO comprises cash provided by operating activities before working capital changes, less tax and net interest payments plus dividends received and certain other expenses, comprising a legal settlement and net incremental metal leak costs incurred in 2015.
Readily marketable inventories Readily marketable inventories RMI, comprising the core inventories which underpin and facilitate Glencores marketing activities, represent inventories, that in Glencores assessment, are readily convertible into cash in the short term due to their liquid nature, widely available markets and the fact that price risk is covered either by a forward physical sale or hedge transaction.
Glencore regularly assesses the composition of these inventories and their applicability, relevance and availability to the marketing activities.
As at 31 December 2015, $15,356 million 2014: $19,226 million of inventories were considered readily marketable.
This comprises $10,928 million 2014: $16,297 million of inventories carried at fair value less costs of disposal and $4,428 million 2014: $2,929 million carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
During 2015, Glencore reassessed the RMI categorisation and eligibility of certain inventories held by the Groups metals smelting operations.
Given the highly liquid nature of these inventories, which represent a significant share of current assets, the Group believes it is appropriate to consider them together with cash equivalents in analysing Group net debt levels and computing certain debt coverage ratios and credit trends.
