170 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY 3 Accounting policies: Anglo American plc the Company The Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements FRS 100 and 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the statement of comprehensive income of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The profit after tax for the year of the Company amounted to $1,850 million 2014: $2,019 million.
First time application of FRS 100 and FRS 101 In the current year the Company has adopted FRS 100 and FRS 101.
In previous years the financial statements were prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The change in the basis of preparation has not materially altered the recognition and measurement requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP.
Consequently the principal accounting policies are unchanged from the prior year.
The change in basis of preparation has enabled the Company to take advantage of all the available disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 101 in the financial statements.
There have been no other material amendments to the disclosure requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP.
Significant accounting policies Investments Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Financial Instruments The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the instrument.
Financial instruments are fide-recognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire.
Dividends Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
For those share schemes with market vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo model at the grant date.
The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using a Black Scholes model.
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the grant date.
For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the associated charge.
Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
The Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings.
Equity settled share-based payments that are made to employees of the Companys subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Companys investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included in the Company financial statements are set out in note 28 to the Consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015.
