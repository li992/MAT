above in the section setting out the judgements made in respect of Supplier Income, the calculation of the value deferred into stock is complicated due to the number, nature and structure of the agreements in place.
However, the Group has a well tested methodology that is consistently applied and which the Directors believe recognises the appropriate deduction from the gross invoice cost of stock.
Furthermore, determining the net realisable value of the wider range of products held in many locations requires judgement to be applied to determine the likely saleability of the product and the potential price that can be achieved.
In arriving at any provisions for net realisable value the Directors take into account the age, condition and quality of the product stocked and the recent trend in sales.

154 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic Report Governance & Remuneration Financial Statements Shareholder Information FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2015 Trading conditions in the wholesale and contract led Plumbing and Heating market have been challenging and as a consequence, following the annual impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Group has recognised an impairment charge in respect of PTS 109.9m and F&P 30.7m totalling 140.6m.
Details of the allocation of the impairment charge are given in note 13.
2014 The programme to reconfigure the Plumbing and Heating business resulted in the Group and the Company incurring 29.5m and 2.1m respectively of exceptional operating charges.
Details of the exceptional provision is given in note 25.
10.0m of surplus exceptional onerous lease provision was credited back to operating profit following the surrender of the lease on a property.
The Group disposed of its investment in Rinus Roofing Limited for 2.8m and recorded a loss of 4.6m, 5.1m in the Company, as loans previously advanced to that company and the Groups equity investment were not fully recovered.
In accordance with IAS 39 the contingent consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of Solfex was reassessed with the discounted amount previously recognised being reduced by 0.8m in the Group and in the Company.
e. Prior period restatement The company operates Group wide equity settled share incentive schemes and in 2015 the directors reviewed the application of IFRS 2 share based payments.
In prior periods, in the individual accounts of Travis Perkins plc, the credit to equity arising on equity settled share based payments has been incorrectly restricted to the value attributable to employees of Travis Perkins plc only.
This has been restated to show the credit to equity as being the value of share based payments arising on all Group wide equity settled schemes.
As subsidiaries are not recharged for the share based payment charge the amount is debited to cost of investment.
The impact on the balance sheet in 2014 and 2013 is shown below.
All four divisions sell building materials to a wide range of customers, none of which are dominant, and operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom and consequently no geographical information is presented.
Segment result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of certain central costs finance income and costs and income tax expense.
Unallocated segment assets and liabilities comprise financial instruments, current and deferred taxation, cash and borrowings and pension scheme assets and liabilities.
During 2015 an impairment loss was recognised in the Plumbing and Heating segment on goodwill and other intangible assets totalling 140.6m.
In 2014 there were no impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss or in equity in any of the reportable segments.
As a result net assets with a net book value of 1m were transferred between the segments.
There were no inter segment transfers in 2015.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2015 2014 Executive SAYE Nil price Executive SAYE Nil price Options options Options options Share price at grant date pence 1,948 2,022 1,964 1,787 1,665 1,832 Option exercise price pence 1,959 1,616 - 1,796 1,390 - Volatility % 24.2% 23.4% 24.2% 29.0% 28.2% 29.3% Option life years 3.0 3.3 2.9 3.0 3.4 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % 0.7% 0.9% 0.7% 1.2% 1.4% 1.1% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % 2.2% 2.1% 2.2% 1.9% 1.9% 1.9% Volatility is based on historic share prices over a period equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of three times within the Boards target range.
The expected life of options used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A description of the share schemes operated by the Group is contained in the remuneration report on pages 110 to 125.

GOODWILL continued Cash generating units The Directors consider that each branch in the Group is an individual Cash Generating Unit CGU.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated and monitored for impairment testing purposes to groups of individual CGUs within the same brand.
The following analyses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives by CGU grouping.
As a consequence of this restructuring the Directors determined that the goodwill and other intangibles associated with the PTS branches that are rebranded as City Plumbing Supplies should be reallocated to the City Plumbing Supplies CGU.
Therefore 65m of goodwill has been transferred from the PTS CGU to the City Plumbing Supplies CGU.
Measuring recoverable amounts The Group tests goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and like-for-like market volume changes which impact sales and therefore cash flow projections and maintenance capital expenditure.
Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU groupings that are not reflected in the cash flow projections.
At the beginning and end of the financial year the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in all segments was in excess of their book value after the adjustment for impairment at 31 December 2015 outlined below.
In the absence of a binding agreement to sell the assets and active reference market on which fair value can be determined the recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was determined according to value in use.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred other than detailed below.
The key variables applied to the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts, which were derived from the most recent board approved corporate plan 166 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic Report Governance & Remuneration Financial Statements Shareholder Information FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The sales market volume assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are the Directors estimates of likely future changes based on historic performance excluding future investment and enhancements and the current outlook for both the UK economy and the UK building materials industry.
This is viewed as the key operating assumption because the state of the building materials market determines the Directors approach to margin and cost maintenance A risk adjusted pre tax discount rate is calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
For 2015, the pre tax discount rate ranged between 9.0% and 9.8% 2014: 9.45% to 10.28%, which is not significantly different for any individual CGU or CGU grouping.
That is because each CGU operates in the same market, selling the same product types therefore the risk profiles are not dissimilar For 2015, cash flows beyond the corporate plan 2020 and beyond have been determined using a growth rate of 2.1%, which is the average long-term forecast GDP growth outlined in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook report produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
The Directors believe this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available 2014 growth rate: 2.1% Impairment Following the annual impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets, the Group has recognised an impairment charge totalling 140.6m.
Trading conditions in the wholesale and contract led Plumbing and Heating market have been challenging and as a consequence expectations of future profitability were reduced in the value in use calculations.
The impairment charge has been allocated as follows.
CGU Goodwill Acquired Acquired Total Brands Customer Relationships m m m m F & P 30.3 0.3 0.1 30.7 PTS 68.7 38.2 3.0 109.9 99.0 38.5 3.1 140.6 Sensitivity of results to changes in assumptions Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results Changes to the way the assets are used or changes to the strategy for the business A deterioration in the UK economy The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
For most of the CGU groupings, given the prudence already built into the Groups corporate plan and the level of headroom they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key operating assumptions that are sufficient to generate a different outcome to the impairment calculations undertaken.
However, for the CGU groupings listed in the table below this is not the case as the Directors consider that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions could result in discounted future cash flows being insufficient to allow full recovery of the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill and other intangible assets.
The Directors have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the specific value for each assumption, all other assumptions remaining the same, that would result in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equalling their recoverable amounts and these are shown in the tables below.
The sole market value adjustment is the average annual change incorporated in the corporate plan of each CGU grouping.

Accordingly for Toolstation, Plumbnation, Solfex, Primaflow, Underfloor Heating, Bathrooms.
com and certain product related brands the Directors have decided it is appropriate to amortise their cost over their estimated useful lives.
The useful lives of those brands being amortised range from 10 to 20 years while the remaining lives range from 4 to 14 years.
The Directors consider that the other brands excluding PTS and F & P which have been impaired in 2015, which are also all leading brands in their sectors with significant histories and significant growth prospects have an indefinite useful life.
They are reviewed annually for impairment: details of impairment testing are shown in note 13.

The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term taken for sales of goods is 55 days 2014: 55 days.
The allowance for doubtful debts is estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
The business has provided fully for all receivables outstanding for more than 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables which have been outstanding for less than 90 days that are not considered recoverable are specifically provided for.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at between 2% to 4% per annum above the clearing bank base rate on the outstanding balance.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors unprovided against with a carrying amount of 66.8m 2014: 84.1m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable and therefore there is no allowance for doubtful debts.

Trade and other payables exclude taxation and social security and accruals and deferred income totalling 172.4m 2014: 220.0m.
Deferred consideration payable totalling 1.2m is included in financial liabilities designated as fair value through profit and loss.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group has considered the impact of credit risk on its financial instruments and because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings considers its impact to be immaterial.
c. Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 179 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24.

Interest risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest ratecycles.
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on either a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swap contracts where necessary.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
On 15 September 2014 the Group and Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with seven syndicate banks which swapped the fixed rate payable on the listed sterling bond of 4.375% to floating rates based on 6 month libor.
These interest rate swap contracts, totalling a notional amount of 250m, are all designated and effective as fair value hedges.
At 31 December 2015 the fair value of the interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate more than five years from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties, was estimated at 6.3m 2014: 8.0.
This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value thereof has been credited to the income statement where it is matched with the fair value movement of the associated sterling bond.

The floating leg is settled every six months whilst the receivable fixed leg is settled annually.
e. Cross currency swaps and currency forward contracts In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $200m unsecured senior notes the Group and Company have two cross currency swaps of 23m and 29m to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of $90m of the unsecured senior notes.
The hedging risk on the remaining $110m is eliminated through the use of forward currency contracts.
The forward options fixed the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 52m as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The two currency swaps convert the borrowing rates on US$50m and US$40m of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5 and 86.7 respectively.
The currency swaps settle on a half-yearly basis.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a gross basis.
Currency swap contracts exchanging fixed rate interest for floating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 0.7m 2014: 1.3m, which was included in the income statement at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was also included in the income statement.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of currency swap contracts accounted for as fair value hedges as at the reporting date: Fair value hedges outstanding receive fixed pay floating contracts Average contract Notional principal Fair value floating interest amount rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 % % m m m m Less than 1 year 1.6 1.6 52.0 52.0 11.7 10.7 52.0 52.0 11.7 10.7 The Group and the Company have three currency forward contracts with a notional value of $30m each and one with a notional value of 20m to hedge $110m of unsecured senior notes.
These contracts have a maturity date of January 2016.
At 31 December 2015 the fair value of these forward contracts was estimated at 3.2m 2014: 0.5 m. These contracts are designated cash flow hedges.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$72.4m 2014: US$75.0m.
The fair value of these derivatives is 1.3m 2014: 2.5m.
These contracts are not designated cash flow hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: Profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have decreased increased by 4.1m 2014: increased decreased by 3.1m Net equity would have decreased increased by 3.2m 2014: increased decreased by 2.4m mainly because of the changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives 25.

The Group recognised in 2014 an exceptional provision of 16.1m relating to the reconfiguration of the Plumbing and Heating division.
The provision covered expected property costs, legal costs and IT costs arising from the reconfiguration.
Should a provision ultimately prove to be unnecessary then it is credited back into the income statement.
Where the provision was originally established as an exceptional item, any release is shown as an exceptional credit.
It is Group policy to insure itself using policies with a high excess against claims arising in respect of damage to assets, or due to employers or public liability claims.
The nature of insurance claims means they may take some time to be settled.
The insurance claims provision represents managements best estimate, based upon external advice of the value of outstanding claims against it where the final settlement date is uncertain.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised because it is improbable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the losses because they arose prior to the Group acquiring Wickes and that business owns no assets that may generate a future capital gain against which the losses can be offset.
Other than disclosed above, no deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.

The Company Trade and other payables principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three final salary schemes being The Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP scheme, the BSS schemes being the BSS Defined Benefit Scheme and the immaterial BSS Ireland Defined Benefit Scheme.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The TP scheme is for the majority of members a 1 60th scheme.
The assets of the TP schemes are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the schemes trustees.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2014.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2014 valuation, and then updated to 31 December 2015 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
The assets of the BSS schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the BSS schemes assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out at 30 September 2014.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010, an agreement was reached with the trustees of the Travis Perkins final salary pension scheme to fund 34.7m of the deficit using a group controlled special purpose vehicle SPV.
The pension scheme is entitled to receive the income of the SPV for a period of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.
As the SPV is consolidated into the Travis Perkins plc group accounts advantage has been taken of Regulation 7 of The Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 and accounts for the SPV will neither be audited or filed.
2014 Restatement The 2014 pension numbers in respect of the TP Scheme have been restated to reduce the return on plan assets in the year by 14.8m to exclude the contingent rentals from the value of the liability to the pension scheme with an equal and opposite reduction to the additional liability recognised in respect of the minimum funding requirement.
There was no overall effect on the total pension liability.
The TP scheme and the BSS schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
A summary of the risks and the management of those risks is given below.
186 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic Report Governance & Remuneration Financial Statements Shareholder Information FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities of the schemes is calculated using a discount rate predetermined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If the return on scheme assets is below this rate it may create a plan deficit.
Currently the schemes have a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and real estate.
Due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities the trustees of the pension funds consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the scheme assets should be invested in equities.
Interest risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes liabilities, but the effect will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the schemes debt assets.. Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liabilities of the schemes is calculated by reference to the best estimate of mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the schemes liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liabilities is calculated by reference to the future salaries of scheme participants.
As such an increase in salaries of scheme participants will increase the schemes liabilities.
Major assumptions used by the schemes actuaries at the balance sheet date in nominal terms At 31 December At 31 December 2015 2014 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.45% 2.35% Rate of increase of pensions in payment post 2006 2.20% 2.50% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 1997 -2006 3.10% 3.40% Discount rate 3.85% 3.70% Inflation assumption - RPI 3.20% 3.10% Inflation assumption - CPI 2.20% 2.10% In respect of longevity, the valuation adopts the S2PA year of birth tables with improvements in life expectancy to continue in the medium term, with base year appropriate to the members date of birth.
This results in the following life expectancies at illustrative ages: Weighted average life expectancy for mortality tables used to determine pension liability at 31 December 2015: Male Female Years Years Member age 65 current life expectancy - TP Scheme 22.1 24.7 Member age 45 life expectancy on reaching age 65 - TP Scheme 23.8 26.6 Member age 65 current life expectancy - BSS Schemes 22.1 24.7 Member age 45 life expectancy on reaching age 65 - BSS Schemes 23.8 26.6 b.
