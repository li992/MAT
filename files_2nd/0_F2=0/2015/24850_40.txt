Audited Financial Statements Primary Accounting Policies KEY ACCOUNTING POLICY AND KEY ACCOUNTING JUDGMENT AND AREA OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 The Companys unquoted financial assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss are the most significant element of its Statement of Financial Position and the most significant contributor to its performance as set out in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Consequently, the Board of the Company wish to highlight here the Companys accounting policy for unquoted financial assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss and the accounting judgments and estimation uncertainties which apply to them.
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR UNQUOTED FINANCIAL ASSETS DESIGNATED AS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS All investments are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are initially recognised on the date of purchase on 'trade date' basis at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given, excluding transaction costs associated with the investment.
Investments are subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting date.
Unrealised gains and losses on investments arising from change in the fair value from prior years is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Realised gains or losses on the disposal of investments are determined by reference to average purchase cost.
These are also recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES APPLICABLE TO UNQUOTED FINANCIAL ASSETS DESIGNATED AS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Valuation of current investments In order to assess the fair value of the unquoted non-current and current investments, the NAV of the underlying investments in Highbridge, AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and the ICS Funds is taken into consideration.
The Company's holdings in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged were realisable at their NAV on quarterly dealing days until 1 December 2015 and the Companys holdings in ICS were realisable at their NAV on daily dealing days facilitated by the administrators of these funds.
Having taken account of the Company's history of successfully realising its holdings at NAV, and in the absence of gating or suspension of redemptions of the ICS funds at the Company's year end, the Directors are satisfied that the reported NAV is a fair estimation of fair value of the Company's holding in ICS.
The Directors have considered the circumstances surrounding the compulsory redemption of the Companys investments in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged and consider that the NAV supplied by the independent administrator of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged remains a fair estimation of the fair value of the Companys holdings in AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged as at 31 December 2015.
The Company's NAV is based on valuations of unquoted investments.
As described above, in calculating the NAV and the NAV per share of the Company, the Administrator relies on the NAVs of the shares supplied by the Administrator of the Underlying Fund, AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS Funds.
Those NAVs are themselves based on the NAV of the various investments held by the Underlying Fund, AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and ICS Funds.
