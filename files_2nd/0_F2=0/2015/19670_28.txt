STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Notes to the financial statements 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Spire Healthcare Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively, the Group owns and operates private hospitals and clinics in the UK and provides a range of private healthcare services.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on 16 March 2016.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK registered number: 9084066.
The address of its registered office is 3 Dorset Rise, London, EC4Y 8EN.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
Group reorganisation during 2014 As a result of the Group reorganisation implemented on 23 July 2014 through an exchange of equity interests, the Company became the legal parent of Spire Healthcare Group UK Limited and Spire UK Holdco 2A Limited, together with each of their subsidiaries.
These companies were under common management and control throughout the periods presented and, therefore, the comparative periods have been prepared as if the reorganisation had taken place as at the beginning of the earliest period presented herein.
As the Group reorganisation did not lead to a change in control of the companies included in the Group, it was accounted for using the pooling-of-interest method by aggregating the assets, liabilities, results, share capital and reserves, after eliminating intercompany balances and unrealised profits.
The Consolidated financial statements, therefore, reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the components of the Group that constituted the property ownership and trading businesses.
Going concern The Group is financed by a bank loan facility that matures in 2019.
The Directors have considered the Groups forecasts and projections, and the risks associated with their delivery, and are satisfied that, the Group will be able to operate within the covenants imposed by the bank loan facility for the foreseeable future.
In relation to available cash resources, the Directors have had regard to both cash at bank and a 100.0 million committed undrawn revolving credit facility.
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Significant accounting policies applied The principal accounting policies adopted are described below and were consistently applied for all periods presented, except as noted below.
Revenue recognition The Group derives its revenue primarily from providing private healthcare services to both the public sector and private patients in the UK.
Revenue from charges to patients is recognised when the treatment is provided.
Interest income Interest is recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
Cost of sales Cost of sales principally comprises salaries of clinical staff, consultant and clinical fees, medical services and inventories, including drugs, consumables and prostheses.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Other operating costs Other operating costs mainly comprise non-clinical staff costs, rent associated with properties leased under operating leases, depreciation, maintenance and running costs of properties and equipment.
It also includes administrative expenses, including the provision of central support services, IT and other administrative costs.
Operating profit Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging exceptional items, as defined below.
Operating profit is adjusted to exclude exceptional items to calculate the Key Performance Indicator Operating profit before exceptional items, which is utilised in measuring performance before the impact of non-recurring, exceptional items in the income statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, either individually or in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Consolidation The results of all subsidiary undertakings are included in the Consolidated financial statements.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating costs.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there is an indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or properties under construction.
Other assets are depreciated so as to write off the carrying amounts of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their expected useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings and improvements 5 to 50 years Leasehold buildings and improvements lower of unexpired lease term or expected life, with a maximum of 35 years Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years The expected useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and revised as appropriate.
The review of the asset lives and residual values of properties takes into consideration the plans of the business and levels of expenditure incurred on an ongoing basis to maintain the properties in a fit and proper state for their ongoing use as hospitals and the forecast timing of disposal.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost means purchase price, less trade discounts, calculated on an average basis.
Net realisable value means estimated selling price, less trade discounts, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost on an effective interest basis.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Pensions The Group operates the Spire Healthcare Pension, a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Other employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
Where the share awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Black Scholes valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
Where the share awards have total shareholder return TSR market-related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values see note 28.
The resulting fair values are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
At the end of each year, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market conditions and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered to be an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk-adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
Provisions are measured gross of any expected insurance recovery.
Any such insurance recoveries are recognised separately in receivables when the receipt of them is judged sufficiently probable.
Leases Leasing arrangements which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in tangible assets and depreciated over their estimated economic lives or over the term of the lease, whichever is the shorter.
The capital element of the leasing commitments is included in liabilities as obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligation and the interest element is charged to the income statement in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Taxation including deferred taxation Total income tax on the result for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable result for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss: and investments in subsidiary companies where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be used.
Derivative financial instruments The Group may enter into derivative financial instrument arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to such derivatives if the criteria for doing so are met.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from share premium.
Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders in both the Company and the Consolidated balance sheet until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividend is recognised when paid.
New and amended standards and interpretations The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the Group from 1 January 2015, but either they were not applicable to or did not have a material impact on the Group: IAS 19 Employee Benefits Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20102012 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20112013 Cycle The Group or the Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective on 1 January 2015.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied The following new and amended standards and interpretations in issue are not yet effective and have not been applied by the Group: Effective date Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2016 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20122014 Cycle 1 January 2016 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities: Applying Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017 Amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: Changes in Financing Liabilities 1 January 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB IFRIC standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Groups discretion to early adopt standards.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, these standards and interpretation have not yet been endorsed or adopted by the EU.
The Directors do not expect the adoption of these standards and interpretations to have a material impact on the Consolidated or Parent Company financial statements in the period of initial application, except for IFRS 16 Leases.
The impact of this standard will be evaluated.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The following accounting policies have been identified as involving particularly complex judgements or subjective estimates: Judgements Deferred tax Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available in future against which they can be utilised.
Future taxable profits are estimated based on business plans which include estimates and assumptions regarding economic growth, interest, inflation rates and taxation rates.
The Group owns a portfolio of freehold and leasehold property interests.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax liability in its financial statements in respect of capital gains tax and other taxes based on the assumption that a proportion of the freehold properties will be disposed of in future years, with the remaining properties being realised through use.
This calculation requires judgement about the timing and number of the related property disposals, which is potentially impacted by changes to plans made by the business over time and, in particular, changes in business plans in respect of the holding or disposing of properties.
Leases In the determination of the classification of a number of leases over hospital properties as operating leases, assumptions have been made about the discount rate applied to the annual rent payable over the remainder of the lease term compared against their respective fair values and of the useful economic life of the hospitals.
Further information about commitments under these leases is given in note 29.
Exceptional items Judgements are required as to whether items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional.
Deciding which items meet this definition requires the Group to exercise its judgement.
Details of these items categorised as exceptional are outlined in note 8.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES continued Estimates Estimation of useful lives and residual values Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives, taking into account residual values, where appropriate.
The actual lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of factors.
In reassessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken into account.
Residual value assessments consider issues such as the remaining lives of the assets and projected disposal values.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are set out in note 3.
Goodwill Goodwill is considered for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
This is achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the goodwill with its carrying value in the accounts.
The value-in-use calculations require the Group to estimate future cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions.
The present value of these cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate.
The assumptions considered to be most critical in reviewing goodwill for impairment are contained in note 16.
Share-based payments At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The assumptions considered to be most critical in estimating share-based payments are contained in note 28.
Provisions for patient claims In the measurement of such provisions where the recognition criteria are met, the typical complexity of claims for example in respect of their outcome and the extent of damages if any assessed on the Group requires management to use estimation.
Such estimates are typically based on professional advice on expected outcomes and historic information on similar claims.
In some cases, judgement is also required, for example, as to whether the criteria for recognising provisions are met and whether a reliable estimate of the outcomes can be made.
Further details of claims and the amounts provided are given in note 23.

SEGMENTAL REPORTING In determining the Groups operating segment, management has primarily considered the financial information in the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive management team and the Board of Directors in aggregate the chief operating decision maker in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.
The financial information in those internal reports in respect of revenue and expenses has led management to conclude that the Group has a single operating segment, being the provision of healthcare services.
All revenue is attributable to and all non-current assets are located in the United Kingdom.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS million Goodwill Cost: At 1 January 2014 516.2 Additions in the year 6.6 Disposal in the year 2.7 At 1 January 2015 31 December 2015 520.1 Impairment: At 1 January 2014 1.3 Charge for the year 1.0 Disposal in the year 1.3 At 1 January 2015 31 December 2015 1.0 Net book value: At 31 December 2015 519.1 At 31 December 2014 519.1 The goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment or when there is an event that may indicate impairment.
The prior years impairment of 1.0 million relates to the Groups goodwill in relation to an investment in a medical practice following a CMA Final Order.
The Directors do not believe that any impairment is required in the current financial year.
Impairment testing The Directors treat the business as a single cash-generating unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is calculated by reference to its estimated value-in-use.
In order to estimate the value-in-use, management has used trading projections covering the three-year period to December 2018, which were extended to cover the five-year period to December 2020.
Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculations, being revenue growth, which is impacted by an interaction of a number of elements of the operating model, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of discharges, assumptions regarding cost inflation and discount rates.
These variables are interdependent and the forecast cash flows reflect managements expectations based on current market trends.
Revenue growth is projected to be in line with past experience and expectations of future performance, averaging 5.9% for the five-year period 2014: 5.9%.
Cost assumptions are consistent with the Groups historic track record, after taking account of headline inflation at 2.7% 2014: 3.3%.
A long-term growth rate of 2.25% 2014: 2.25% has been applied to cash flows beyond 2020, which is based on historic growth rates achieved by the sector, which have typically exceeded retail price index RPI.
Pre-tax discount rates were based on the capital asset pricing model, utilising a sector-specific Beta in arriving at the equity premium and cost of debt based on current bank lending rates.
A specific pre-tax discount rate was calculated to reflect the profile of cash flows inherent to the cash-generating unit and this was 9.0% 2014: 10.2%.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, an increase of 3.0% in the pre-tax discount rate to 12.0%, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments.
Similarly, zero growth in the period beyond 2020, with all other assumptions held constant or combined with a 1.0% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, did not identify any impairment.
As at the balance sheet date, it is not considered to be reasonably possible that circumstances will change, such that the key assumptions made in assessing the recoverable amount relating to each of the acquisitions will be revised to the point where the goodwill is considered impaired.

Some of the agreements with NHS customers operate on the basis of monthly payments on account with quarterly reconciliations, which can lead to invoices being paid after their due date.
The ageing of trade receivables is shown below and shows amounts that are past due at the reporting date.
A provision for doubtful receivables has been recognised at the reporting date through consideration of the ageing profile of the Groups receivables and the perceived credit quality of its customers.

BORROWINGS continued Terms and debt repayment schedule The maturity date is the date on which the relevant bank loans are due to be fully repaid, as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amounts drawn after issue costs and including interest accrued under facilities in place at the balance sheet date were as follows: million Maturity Margin over LIBOR 2015 2014 Senior finance facility July 2019 2.00% 423.1 422.2 Revolving credit facility undrawn committed facility 100.0 100.0 On 23 July 2014, the Group was refinanced, and it entered into a bank loan facility with a syndicate of banks, comprising a five-year, 425.0 million term loan and a five-year 100.0 million revolving facility.
The loan is non-amortising and carries interest at a margin of 2.00% over LIBOR 2014: 2.25% over LIBOR.

The provisions are shown gross of any expected reimbursement from insurers of the related risks.
The reimbursement is recognised as a separate receivable when receipt of it is judged sufficiently probable.
The amount in receivables in that respect was 6.2 million 2014: nil.
In prior years, the provision represented the net amount expected to be paid under excess arrangements with the insurers, but no adjustment has made to the presentation of the prior year numbers as any change is considered immaterial.
Provisions as at 31 December 2015 are expected to be utilised within three years.
The Group has received claims and notifications from patients of a consultant, who previously had practising privileges at Spire Healthcare.
The patients are claiming against the consultant and other involved parties including the Group.
Court hearings are scheduled for a limited number of claims in June 2017 through which precedent will be established regarding how future claims will be treated.
The Group is defending such claims and the legal process is expected to take place over a period of several years.
There is significant uncertainty regarding the number of claims, the outcome of the claims, any amounts to be awarded to each claimant and the apportionment of damages between the parties.
It is, therefore, not possible to reliably estimate any liability of the Group.
The Group maintains comprehensive medical malpractice insurance, and in the event that the Group is found liable, the Directors consider that insurers will meet any such liabilities, subject to certain terms and excess limitations.

DEFERRED TAXATION The movement for the year in the net deferred tax liability is as follows: Property, Derivative plant and financial Losses million equipment Instruments and other Total At 1 January 2014 99.9 14.9 25.0 60.0 Recognised in profit or loss 10.1 14.9 18.5 13.7 Additions on business combination 1.9 1.9 Recognised in equity 0.4 0.4 At 1 January 2015 91.7 43.9 47.8 Recognised in profit or loss 6.1 17.6 11.5 Change in tax rates 7.8 2.0 5.8 Recognised in equity 0.1 0.1 At 31 December 2015 77.8 24.2 53.6 Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has arisen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base.
Of the amounts included in losses and other, 23.0 million 2014: 30.5 million relate to losses.
Other deferred tax items relate to temporary differences on non-specific provisions and expense accruals.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
The Finance Bill 2015, which includes a stepped reduction in the UK corporate tax rate from 20.0% to 18.0% on 1 April 2020, has been enacted and so deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate unless the timing difference is expected to reverse sooner than 1 April 2020 in which case the applicable rate of 20.0% or 19.0% has been used.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2015 as follows: million 2015 2014 Trading losses 1.9 1.9 Capital losses 0.3 0.3 Tax basis for future capital disposals 10.7 9.2 12.9 11.4 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to the timing of future profits that the trading losses could be set against and whether capital gains will arise against which the capital losses could be utilised.

COMMITMENTS a Operating leases The Group had future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, based on rents prevailing at the year end, as set out below: 2015 2014 Land and Land and million buildings Other buildings Other Not later than one year 62.9 0.9 61.9 0.7 Later than one year and not later than five years 250.1 1.7 244.0 1.4 Later than five years 1,334.2 1,353.0 1,647.2 2.6 1,658.9 2.1 The Group has a number of long-term institutional lease arrangements.
These include leases over 12 properties with a term up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension over each of the 12 properties.
The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital expenditure invested by the Group.
Rent is indexed annually in line with RPI, subject to a floor of 0.0% and a cap of 5.0%.
The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the term of the leases, require the Group to incur, in total, 5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and 3.0 million of additional capital expenditure each year, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI.
b Consignment stock At 31 December 2015, the Group held consignment stock on sale or return of 20.9 million 2014: 19.3 million.
The Group is only required to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and therefore this stock is not recognised as an asset.
c Capital expenditure commitments Capital commitments comprise amounts payable under capital contracts which are duly authorised and in progress at the balance sheet date.
They include the full cost of goods and services to be provided under the contracts through to completion.
The Group has rights within its contracts to terminate at short notice and, therefore, cancellation payments are minimal.
Capital commitments at the end of the year were as follows: million 2015 2014 Contracted but not provided for 39.4 6.4 30.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Group had the following guarantees at 31 December 2015: Spire Healthcare Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, had entered into an Authorised Guarantee Agreement AGA with regard to the premises of the former customer contact centre at Victoria Harbour City, Manchester.
Under the AGA, Spire Healthcare Limited acted as a guarantor to the new tenants until the end of the lease term, in January 2016.
The maximum contingent liability at the balance sheet date was 0.3 million 2014: 0.8 million.
The guarantee has since lapsed and Spire Healthcare Limited is no longer liable to any contingent liability.
The bankers to Spire Healthcare Limited have issued a letter of credit in the maximum amount of 1.5 million 2014: 1.5 million in relation to contractual pension obligations and statutory insurance cover in respect of the Groups potential liability to claims made by employees under the Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance Act 1969.
Under certain lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010, the Group has given undertakings relating to obligations in the lease documentation and the assets of the Group are subject to a fixed and floating charge.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 131 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 31.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the Group to continue as a going concern, to continue the future development of the business and to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.
The Board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt.
The Groups net assets at 31 December 2015 were 997.6 million 2014: 955.0 million and net debt, calculated as total debt comprising obligations under finance leases and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents, amounted to 419.5 million 2014: 424.3 million.
The principal focus of capital management revolves around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial covenants.
Throughout the period, the Group complied with all covenants required by our lending group.
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval by the Board.
At the balance sheet date, the Groups committed undrawn facilities, and cash and cash equivalents, were as follows: million 2015 2014 Committed undrawn revolving credit facility 100.0 100.0 Cash and cash equivalents 78.9 74.5 32.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: and market risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Groups exposure to credit risk from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policies in place to prevent credit risk occurring.
Most revenues arise from insured patients business and the NHS.
Insured revenues give rise to trade receivables which are mainly due from large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness.
The remainder of revenues arise from individual Self-pay patients and consultants.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also a collective loss component established in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified, determined based on historical data of payment statistics.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Note 20 shows the ageing and customer profiles of trade receivables outstanding at the year end.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in short-term money market deposits with large financial institutions, which must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rating agencies.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Liquidity is managed across the Group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for regulatory purposes.
Short-term operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand and overdraft facilities.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Bases of valuation The management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The carrying value of the other financial instruments, being finance leases and debt, is approximately equal to their fair value based on a review of current terms against market and expected short-term settlements, except for floating rate debt, which is after the deduction of 4.0 million 2014: 5.1 million of issue costs.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group did not hold any financial instruments measured at fair value 2014: nil.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates.
This affects future cash flows from money market investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings.
From time-to-time, the Group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium-term derivative financial instruments.
Interest rates on variable rate loans are determined by LIBOR fixings on a quarterly basis.
Interest is settled on all loans in line with agreements and is settled at least annually.
