Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation and Measurement The financial statements of the parent company have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Company is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRSs for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1.
In preparing its opening IFRS Balance Sheet, the Company has identified no differences in its financial statements as compared to those reported previously in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
A summary of the more important accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year are set out below.
Functional and Presentation Currency The functional currency of the parent company is British Pounds.
The financial statements of the parent company are presented in US dollars.
Foreign Currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of the parent company at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
On translation of the Company financial statements from functional currency to presentational currency the assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Profit and loss accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to reserves.
Investments Investments are stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment in value and are held for long-term investment purposes.
Provisions are based upon an assessment of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that an impairment has occurred such as the performance and or prospects including the financial prospects of the investee company being significantly below the expectations on which the investment was based, a significant adverse change in the markets in which the investee company operates or a deterioration in general market conditions.
Intercompany Loans All intercompany loans are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Where intercompany loans are intended for use on a continuing basis in the Companys activities and there is no intention of their settlement in the foreseeable future, they are presented as current assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

An asset is impaired if the recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Value in use is measured based on future discounted cash flows DCF attributable to the asset.
In such cases, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to recoverable amount with a corresponding charge recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial Instruments Currently the Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and cease to be recognised on the basis of when the related titles pass to or from the Company.
Share-based Payments Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
