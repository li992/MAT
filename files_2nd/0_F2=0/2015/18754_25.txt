104 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 104 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its businesses, primarily in the UK.
a. UK schemes: benefits, governance, cash flow obligations and investments The Group operates three main defined benefit final salary pension schemes in the UK which are all closed to new employees and largely closed to future benefit accrual.
The schemes are the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme comprising the Group, Motors, Normand and Cash sections, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
Cash is a defined benefit cash balance scheme which is designed to meet regulatory requirements for auto-enrolment legislation.
Benefit structure Final salary schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on final salary at retirement or leaving date, if earlier and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet the obligations under the schemes.
In the event of poor returns, increased life expectancy or higher than expected inflation, the Group is required to address any shortfall through a combination of an increase in contributions or by making appropriate adjustments to the schemes.
Cash balance schemes like Cash allow members to accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members have accrued benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
The Group underwrites the investment risk to normal retirement age 65, but all inflation and mortality risks associated with benefits are borne solely by the members.
Governance Our UK schemes are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK Pensions Regulator.
Benefits are paid to members from separate funds administered by an independent trustee company the Trustee appointed by the Group.
The Trustee is required to act in the best interest of the members, and is responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
Scheme specific cash obligation investment detail Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme Group and Motors Sections closed sections The latest actuarial valuations for these sections were carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 18 years and that a small surplus existed on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.5m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and no further review is scheduled until April 2016.
Each sections investment strategy sees it holding a proportion of its assets in matching assets 75% for the Group section and 40% for the Motors section with the remainder in growth assets.
The matching assets are invested in a liability driven investment solution complemented with absolute return bonds.
They are designed to hedge inflation and interest rate risk in a capitally efficient manner.
The growth assets are invested in assets that are expected to grow at rates significantly faster than each sections liabilities and include diversified growth funds and property.
Normand Section closed section Following the merger into the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, an actuarial valuation for this section was carried out at 5 April 2015 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 17 years and that the section was approximately 76% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.4m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and improving the funding ratio.
It has been agreed that this amount will increase on a year-on-year basis.
The investment strategy is to hold 60% in growth assets and 40% in matching assets.
Cash Section This scheme is a defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013.
An interim valuation was carried out at 5 April 2013 which determined that the scheme was considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
The Group contributes 0.2m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and the next review is in April 2016.
The investment strategy is to be 60% invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
The remaining 40% is to be allocated to absolute return bonds.
com 105 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is subject to most UK regulations.
It is therefore reported under the United Kingdom in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 13 years and that the scheme was approximately 92% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.5m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and improving the funding ratio.
A review as at 31 March 2015 is in progress but has not been completed.
Investments are held in a balanced portfolio of equities and bonds.
TKM Group Pension Scheme closed scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 12 years and that the scheme was considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
No cash contributions were required by the Group and the next review is scheduled for April 2016.
In November 2015, the trustees of the TKM Group Pension Scheme completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the scheme were used to acquire a bulk purchase annuity policy with Aviva under which the benefits payable to the members of the scheme are now fully insured.
The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the scheme with no additional funding required from the Group.
The insurance policy has been structured to enable the scheme, in time, to move to full buy-out, following which Aviva will become directly responsible for the pension payments under the scheme.
As at 31 December 2015, the bulk purchase annuity policy has been accounted for as an asset of the scheme and valued on the same basis as the liabilities that it matches.
The difference between the cost of the annuity and the value of the associated liabilities of approximately 48m has been accounted for as an experience loss within other comprehensive income.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets are held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 4.6m 2014 5.6m.
There are outstanding contributions of 0.1m at the year end 2014 nil.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately from the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 23.9 years 2014 23.8 years for current pensioners and 25.7 years 2014 25.6 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.

com 109 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The following disclosures relate to the Groups defined benefit plans only.
e. Risk management Asset volatility Scheme liabilities are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If scheme assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The combined schemes hold approximately 75% of assets as defensive assets liability driven investment solutions, absolute return bonds and annuity policies which mitigate significant changes in yields, and active monitoring plans are in place to identify opportunities to increase the proportion of such assets further when economically possible.
As the schemes mature, the Group reduces the level of investment risk by investing in defensive assets that are designed to better match the liabilities of the schemes.
However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations.
The Groups investment strategy across the schemes is to mitigate inflation risk through holding inflation-linked assets.
Life expectancy The plans obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty.
All of the schemes conduct scheme-specific mortality investigations annually, to ensure the Group has a clear understanding of any potential increase in liability due to pensioners living for longer than assumed.
The trustees of the scheme hedge this risk by adopting a prudent approach in their assumption for future improvements.
f. Sensitivity analysis The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions used for the UK schemes.
Changes in assumptions have an immaterial effect on the overseas schemes.
Impact on the defined benefit obligation United Kingdom 2015 2014 % % Discount rate -0.25% 3.9 4.2 Discount rate 0.25% -3.7 -3.9 Inflation -0.25% -3.3 -3.4 Inflation 0.25% 3.5 3.6 Life expectancy 1 year 3.5 3.3 The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
g. Expected future cash flows The Group has agreed to pay approximately 2.0m to its defined benefit plans in 2016.
The Group does not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years given the funding position of the largest schemes, which account for 90% of the Groups total pension liabilities.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the UK schemes.

Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits.
The Group assesses the availability of future taxable profits based on historic performance and the forecasts for the Groups operations as are used in the Groups value in use calculations see note 11.
On this basis, the Directors have determined that net deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses in Russia should no longer be recognised, resulting in a deferred tax charge of 4.8m.

114 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 114 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs or group of CGUs hereafter collectively referred to as CGU groups that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination.
These CGU groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
Unless otherwise stated, the Group evaluates goodwill in CGU groupings at a country operation level, e. g. UK Retail, Australia Retail.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups within the following reporting segments: 2015 2014 m m United Kingdom 266.1 262.1 Emerging Markets 21.2 79.6 South Asia 19.4 19.7 Australasia 38.6 41.2 345.3 402.6 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGU groups during the year ended 31 December 2015.
The recoverable amounts of all CGU groups were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five-year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five-year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.
The growth rates used vary between 2% and 5% and are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rates used are calculated as the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant country.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 13% and reflect long-term country risk.
com 115 Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Intangible assets continued The assumptions used with regards to pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates in those reporting segments with material goodwill balances were as follows: Long-term Discount rate growth rate United Kingdom 10% 2% Emerging Markets 10% to 13% 5% South Asia 10% 2% Australasia 11% 2% Impairment In light of the sustained weaker trading conditions in Russia and the consequent time forecast before market recovery, the Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill in Russia and determined that an impairment charge of 49.5m 2014 47.4m should be recognised, representing the full residual carrying value of goodwill in the business.
The discount rate applied to the value in use calculation for Russia was 13.3% 2014 12.5% and the long-term growth rate was 4.5% 2014 4.5%.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the long-term growth rates.
With the exception of the Groups businesses in Lithuania, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the other CGU groups.
The Groups goodwill in the Emerging Markets segment at 31 December 2015 is allocated as follows: Impairment Net book Cost provision value m m m Russia 90.4 90.4 Latvia 38.8 38.8 Lithuania 19.0 19.0 Other 2.4 0.2 2.2 At 31 December 2015 150.6 129.4 21.2 The value in use calculations for the Groups business in Lithuania currently exceed the carrying value by approximately 10%.
A 0.5% increase in the discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would eliminate the remaining headroom.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Groups broad customer base across a number of geographic regions.

The asset represents 107m 2014 107m of trading losses.
The unprovided asset relates to losses which exist within legal entities where forecast taxable profits are not probable in the foreseeable future.
This now includes the losses associated with the Groups operations in Russia following a reassessment of the availability of suitable profits in that market which resulted in the exceptional tax cost of 4.8m see notes 8 and 11.
The deferred tax asset on trading losses of 3.5m 2014 6.3m relates to Chile 0.5m, China 0.9m, Greece 0.5m and all other territories 1.6m where future taxable profits are probable.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 25m 2014 28m relating to capital losses.
The asset represents 139m 2014 138m of losses at the UK future standard rate of 18.0% 2014 20.0%.
The key territory holding the losses is the UK.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries on the basis that the Group can control the timing of dividends.
In addition, the majority of overseas reserves can now be repatriated to the UK with no tax cost.
There are a small number of territories that do not qualify for this treatment.
This principally relates to Ethiopia where dividend tax of 2.5m 2014 1.9m is accrued based on current year after tax earnings.
The 4.4m 2014 7.3m net deferred tax liability for other timing differences consists of a 17.2m 2014 20.3m liability in respect of the net book value of tangible fixed assets that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations and a net 12.8m 2014 13.0m deferred tax asset in respect of provisions and other temporary differences between the accounts base and the tax base.
The key temporary differences are a 12.9m asset in Australia less other deferred tax liabilities of 0.1m 2014 2.0m asset in Africa, 3.0m asset in UK, 10.0m asset in Australia less other deferred tax liabilities of 2.0m.

The Group also has various financial assets such as trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits which arise from its trading operations.
The Groups primary derivative transactions are forward and swap currency contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
The purpose is to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from the Groups trading operations and its sources of finance.
Group policy is that there is no trading or speculation in derivatives.

com 127 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable netting arrangements or similar agreements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities if the amounts relate to the same transaction and are in the same currency.
If the parties subject to the agreement do not elect to settle on a net basis, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis.
However, each party to the netting agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of a default of the other party.
c. Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
d. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2015, the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups Private Placement loan notes, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on bank borrowings, supplier related finance and cash balances as at 31 December 2015 with all other variables held constant.
Increase Effect on profit in basis before tax points m 2015 Sterling 75 3.9 Euro 50 0.9 Russian Rouble 500 1.0 Australian Dollar 100 2.1 2014 Sterling 75 3.5 Euro 50 0.2 Russian Rouble 500 Australian Dollar 100 1.7 128 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 128 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial instruments continued e. Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units functional currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group, these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australasia, which purchases vehicles and parts in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39, hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$436m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Increase decrease in Effect on exchange equity rate m 2015 Yen 10% 0.1 Yen -10% 0.1 2014 Yen 10% Yen -10% f. Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.
The table below analyses the Groups short-term deposits and derivative assets by credit exposure excluding bank balances and cash in hand: 2015 2014 Derivative Short-term Derivative Short-term assets deposits assets deposits Credit rating of counterparty m m m m AA- 72.7 8.6 0.7 18.2 A 5.9 31.2 26.0 A 52.9 47.5 101.5 76.9 A- 1.0 0.4 9.3 BBB 2.0 5.2 BBB 1.0 1 No rating 45.0 28.9 134.5 138.5 102.6 159.3 1.
Counterparties in certain markets in which the Group operates do not have a credit rating.
com 129 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 335.3m 2014 368.9m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
g. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2015 and 2014 based on expected contractual undiscounted cash flows: Between Less than 3 to 12 Between Greater than 3 months months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total 2015 m m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 459.6 14.2 473.8 Trade and other receivables 249.8 14.4 6.8 0.6 271.6 Available for sale financial assets 0.1 0.1 0.8 0.4 1.4 Derivative financial instruments 13.9 33.3 376.3 423.5 723.4 62.0 383.9 1.0 1,170.3 Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 99.2 18.2 332.2 1.4 451.0 Trade and other payables 1,371.6 88.3 7.8 1,467.7 Derivative financial instruments 3.3 5.5 274.8 283.6 1,474.1 112.0 614.8 1.4 2,202.3 Net outflows 750.7 50.0 230.9 0.4 1,032.0 Between Less than 3 to 12 Between Greater than 3 months months 1 to 5 years 5 years Total 2014 m m m m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 509.8 18.4 528.2 Trade and other receivables 213.9 12.8 5.4 1.1 233.2 Available for sale financial assets 0.2 0.2 0.6 0.4 1.4 Derivative financial instruments 2.1 19.3 375.1 396.5 726.0 50.7 381.1 1.5 1,159.3 Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 111.6 17.3 341.9 1.4 472.2 Trade and other payables 1,051.9 116.9 22.0 1,190.8 Derivative financial instruments 18.0 15.4 279.9 313.3 1,181.5 149.6 643.8 1.4 1,976.3 Net outflows 455.5 98.9 262.7 0.1 817.0 130 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 130 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial instruments continued h. Fair value measurement In accordance with IFRS 13, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2015.

com 131 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2014 15 months.
The nominal principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2015 was 535.3m 2014 746.0m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2015 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2014 15 months.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2015, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m, which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year Private Placement loan notes.
Under these swaps, the Group receives fixed rate US Dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays GBP LIBOR 85bps and GBP LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after the debt reduction in 2009 to offset the nonrequired portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under this swap, the Group pays US Dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives GBP LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Capital management The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.

Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order Inchcape is a participant in an action in the United Kingdom against HM Revenue and Customs HMRC in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO.
There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The action concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
The resolution of test cases is incomplete.
The current status of the test claims is that a judgment on a range of issues of quantification was given in the High Court on 18 December 2014 and permission has been granted to both HMRC and the test claimants to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
The appeal hearing is now expected to take place in June 2016.
Inchcape is not a test case and its specific claim has not been considered by the Courts.
In January 2016, the management judge of the GLO, Henderson J, granted summary judgment to seven other corporate groups in the GLO in relation to their claims for restitution of Advance Corporation Tax ACT paid under the Foreign Income Dividend FID regime which is a subsidiary component of the claims in the FII GLO.
The Judge found that liability for the FID component of the claims has now been conclusively determined in the British American Tobacco BAT test case and that these other FID claims are in an identical position.
Accordingly, the Judge found that those claimants are entitled to summary judgment on that part of their claims save for a portion of compound interest which is still subject to litigation in another case.
In September 2015, Inchcape also filed an application at the High Court for summary judgment in respect of the component of its claim in the FII GLO with a hearing planned for February 2016.
HMRC and Inchcape agreed that Inchcapes application is also to be determined on the basis of the January judgment handed down in respect of the other seven claimants.
Inchcape has therefore also been awarded summary judgment on the FID component of its claim but without the need for a hearing.
The judge refused HMRCs application for permission to appeal the summary judgments on the basis that their case was unarguable.
Notwithstanding this, HMRC has renewed that application to the Court of Appeal.
The amount expected to be paid by HMRC to the Group under the summary judgment is approximately 6.5m.
This amount is calculated partially on a simple interest basis.
The calculation of the amount due is still under dispute and so could change in the future, for example as a result of the resolution of the litigation referred to above in respect of compound interest.
It is also subject to refund if HMRC were granted leave to appeal and that appeal was successful.
The amount due will be subject to the new 45% withholding tax introduced in Finance No.
The legality of this tax is itself also the subject of litigation.
No potential receipts have been recognised in the period to 31 December 2015 in the results of the Group due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome as at that date.
