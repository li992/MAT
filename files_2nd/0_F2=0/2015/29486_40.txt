As noted on page 28, in the second half of 2015, management completed the review of all historic Group companies, a project that commenced a number of years ago.
During this process management identified further capital losses which it is expected will be utilised over the next ten years, albeit the actual rate of utilisation will depend on business growth and external factors, particularly investment market conditions.
Therefore a further deferred tax asset of 74.8 million has been established within the IFRS result.
