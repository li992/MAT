d Tax reconciliation The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate of the home country of the Company as follows: Shareholder Policyholder 2015 Shareholder Policyholder 2014 m m m m m m Total profit loss before tax 1,390 218 1,172 2,339 382 2,721 Tax calculated at standard UK corporation tax rate of 20.25% 2014: 21.5% 281 44 237 503 82 585 Reconciling items Different basis of tax policyholders 174 174 302 302 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior periods 46 46 36 36 Non-assessable income and items not taxed at the full statutory rate 19 19 22 22 Non-taxable loss profit on sale of subsidiaries and associates 1 1 31 31 Disallowable expenses 67 67 76 76 Different local basis of tax on overseas profits 126 126 138 2 136 Change in future local statutory tax rates 82 82 17 17 Movement in deferred tax not recognised 52 52 3 3 Tax effect of profit from joint ventures and associates 6 6 4 4 Other 3 3 9 9 Total tax charged credited to income statement 311 218 93 601 382 983 The tax credit charge attributable to policyholder returns is removed from the Groups total profit before tax in arriving at the Groups profit before tax attributable to shareholders profits.
As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profit and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Groups pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax credit charge attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.
The difference between the policyholder tax credit charge and the impact of this item in the tax reconciliation can be explained as follows: 2015 2014 m m Tax attributable to policyholder returns 218 382 UK corporation tax at a rate of 20.25% 2014: 21.5% in respect of the policyholder tax deduction 44 82 Different local basis of tax of overseas profits 2 Different basis of tax - policyholders per tax reconciliation 174 302 UK legislation was substantively enacted in July 2013 to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015, resulting in an effective rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 20.25%.
As legislated in Finance No 2 Act 2015, which was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, the UK corporation tax rate will reduce further to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
The reductions in rate from 20% to 19% and then to 18% have been used in the calculation of the UKs deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2015.
In addition, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in France and Italy reflect the reduction in corporation tax rates from 38% to 34.43% effective 1 January 2016 and from 34.3% to 30.8% effective 1 January 2017 respectively.
The effect of the reduction in the future corporation tax rates in the UK, France and Italy on the Groups net deferred tax liabilities is 120 million, comprising an 82 million credit included in the income statement and a 38 million credit included in the statement of comprehensive income.
