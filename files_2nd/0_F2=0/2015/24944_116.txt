Notes on the Financial Statements continued 13 Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value 13 Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value Accounting policy All financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received.
However, sometimes the fair value will be based on other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, without modification or repackaging, or on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates.
When such evidence exists, HSBC recognises a trading gain or loss at inception day 1 gain or loss, being the difference between the transaction price and the fair value.
When significant unobservable parameters are used, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures or is closed out, the valuation inputs become observable or HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis.
However, in cases where HSBC manages a group of financial assets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis but the underlying financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the financial statements, unless they satisfy the IFRSs offsetting criteria as described in Note 32.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Valuation of financial instruments The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded principal market.
The fair values of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets held and offer prices for liabilities issued.
When a financial instrument has a quoted price in an active market, the fair value of the total holding of the financial instrument is calculated as the product of the number of units and the quoted price.
The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, but is not restricted to, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads.
The bid offer spread represents the difference in prices at which a market participant would be willing to buy compared with the price at which they would be willing to sell.
Valuation techniques may incorporate assumptions about factors that other market participants would use in their valuations, including: the likelihood and expected timing of future cash flows on the instrument.
Judgement may be required to assess the counterpartys ability to service the instrument in accordance with its contractual terms.
Future cash flows may be sensitive to changes in market rates: selecting an appropriate discount rate for the instrument.
Judgement is required to assess what a market participant would regard as the appropriate spread of the rate for an instrument over the appropriate risk-free rate: and judgement to determine what model to use to calculate fair value in areas where the choice of valuation model is particularly subjective, for example, when valuing complex derivative products.
A range of valuation techniques is employed, dependent on the instrument type and available market data.
Most valuation techniques are based upon discounted cash flow analyses, in which expected future cash flows are calculated and discounted to present value using a discounting curve.
Prior to considering credit risk, the expected future cash flows may be known, as would be the case for the fixed leg of an interest rate swap, or may be uncertain and require projection, as would be the case for the floating leg of an interest rate swap.
Projection utilises market forward curves, if available.
In option models, the probability of different potential future outcomes must be considered.
In addition, the value of some products is dependent on more than one market factor, and in these cases it will typically be necessary to consider how movements in one market factor may affect the other market factors.
The model inputs necessary to perform such calculations include interest rate yield curves, exchange rates, volatilities, correlations and prepayment and default rates.
For interest rate derivatives with collateralised counterparties and in significant currencies, HSBC uses a discounting curve that reflects the overnight interest rate.
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data.
However, certain financial instruments are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them the measurement of fair value is more judgemental.
An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if, in the opinion of management, a significant proportion of the instruments inception profit or greater than 5% of the instruments valuation is driven by unobservable inputs.
Unobservable in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value consensus pricing data may, for example, be used.
Control framework Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that they are either determined or validated by a function independent of the risk taker.
For all financial instruments where fair values are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable pricing inputs to models, independent price determination or validation is utilised.
In inactive markets HSBC will source alternative market information to validate the financial instruments fair value, with greater weight given to information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable.
The factors that are considered in this regard are, inter alia: the extent to which prices may be expected to represent genuine traded or tradeable prices: the degree of similarity between financial instruments: the degree of consistency between different sources: the process followed by the pricing provider to derive the data: the elapsed time between the date to which the market data relates and the balance sheet date: and HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 378 the manner in which the data was sourced.
For fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework may include, as applicable, development or validation by independent support functions of i the logic within valuation models: ii the inputs to these models: iii any adjustments required outside the valuation models: and iv where possible, model outputs.
Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence and calibration before becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.
Changes in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process.
This process disaggregates changes in fair value into three high level categories: i portfolio changes, such as new transactions or maturing transactions, ii market movements, such as changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices, and iii other, such as changes in fair value adjustments see further below.
The majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GB&M.
GB&Ms fair value governance structure is illustrated below as an example: Financial liabilities measured at fair value In certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific instrument concerned, where available.
An example of this is where own debt in issue is hedged with interest rate derivatives.
When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which are either based upon quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an active market for similar instruments.
In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread which is appropriate to HSBCs liabilities.
The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Groups own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer.
Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using a Libor-based discount curve.
The difference in the valuations is attributable to the Groups own credit spread.
This methodology is applied consistently across all securities.
Structured notes issued and certain other hybrid instrument liabilities are included within trading liabilities and are measured at fair value.
The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC reverse over the contractual life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount.
Fair value hierarchy Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy: Level 1 valuation technique using quoted market price: financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
Level 3 valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

HSBC classifies fair value adjustments as either risk-related or model-related.
The majority of these adjustments relate to GB&M.
Movements in the level of fair value adjustments do not necessarily result in the recognition of profits or losses within the income statement.
For example, as models are enhanced, fair value adjustments may no longer be required.
Similarly, fair value adjustments will decrease when the related positions are unwound, but this may not result in profit or loss.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 380 Global Banking and Markets fair value adjustments 2015 2014 $m $m Type of adjustment Risk-related 1,402 1,958 bid-offer 477 539 uncertainty 95 357 credit valuation adjustment 853 871 debit valuation adjustment 465 270 funding fair value adjustment 442 460 other 0 1 Model-related 97 57 model limitation 92 52 other 5 5 Inception profit Day 1 P&L reserves Note 16 97 114 At 31 December 1,596 2,129 Fair value adjustments declined by $533m during the year.
The most significant movement was a decline of $262m in respect of the uncertainty category, driven by the reclassification to model limitation of an adjustment relating to derivative discounting assumptions.
This adjustment reduced significantly following contract renegotiations with certain counterparties.
The debit valuation adjustment increased by $195m as a result of the widening of HSBCs credit spreads.
Risk-related adjustments Bid-offer IFRS 13 Fair value measurement requires use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value.
Valuation models will typically generate mid-market values.
The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding the position.
Uncertainty Certain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data, and or the choice of model itself may be more subjective.
In these circumstances, there exists a range of possible values that the financial instrument or market parameter may assume and an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, market participants would adopt more conservative values for uncertain parameters and or model assumptions than those used in the valuation model.
Credit valuation adjustment The CVA is an adjustment to the valuation of over-the-counter OTC derivative contracts to reflect within fair value the possibility that the counterparty may default and that HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions see below.
Debit valuation adjustment The DVA is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect within fair value the possibility that HSBC may default, and that HSBC may not pay full market value of the transactions see below.
Funding fair value adjustment The funding fair value adjustment FFVA is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio.
This includes the uncollateralised component of collateralised derivatives in addition to derivatives that are fully uncollateralised.
The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where available.
The expected future funding exposure is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure such as the default of HSBC or the counterparty.
The FFVA and DVA are calculated independently.
Model-related adjustments Model limitation Models used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplifying set of assumptions that do not capture all material market characteristics.
Additionally, markets evolve, and models that were adequate in the past may require development to capture all material market characteristics in current market conditions.
In these circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted.
As model development progresses, model limitations are addressed within the valuation models and a model limitation adjustment is no longer needed.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 381 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Notes on the Financial Statements continued 13 Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value Inception profit Day 1 P&L reserves Inception profit adjustments are adopted when the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs.
The accounting for inception profit adjustments is discussed on page 378. Credit valuation adjustment debit valuation adjustment methodology HSBC calculates a separate CVA and DVA for each HSBC legal entity, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure.
HSBC calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default PD of the counterparty, conditional on the non-default of HSBC, to HSBCs expected positive exposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default.
Conversely, HSBC calculates the DVA by applying the PD of HSBC, conditional on the nondefault of the counterparty, to the expected positive exposure of the counterparty to HSBC and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default.
Both calculations are performed over the life of the potential exposure.
For most products HSBC uses a simulation methodology to calculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty.
This incorporates a range of potential exposures across the portfolio of transactions with the counterparty over the life of the portfolio.
The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants such as counterparty netting agreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty.
For certain types of exotic derivatives where the products are not currently supported by the simulation, or for derivative exposures in smaller trading locations where the simulation tool is not yet available, HSBC adopts alternative methodologies.
The methodologies do not, in general, account for wrong-way risk.
Wrong-way risk arises when the underlying value of the derivative prior to any CVA is positively correlated to the probability of default by the counterparty.
When there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade-specific approach is applied to reflect the wrong-way risk within the valuation.
With the exception of certain central clearing parties, we include all third-party counterparties in the CVA and DVA calculations and do not net these adjustments across Group entities.
We review and refine the CVA and DVA methodologies on an ongoing basis.

Level 3 instruments are present in both ongoing and legacy businesses.
Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, certain other derivatives and predominantly all Level 3 ABSs are legacy positions.
HSBC has the capability to hold these positions.
Private equity including strategic investments HSBCs private equity and strategic investments are generally classified as available for sale and are not traded in active markets.
In the absence of an active market, an investments fair value is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investees financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors, as well as by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market, or the price at which similar companies have changed ownership.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 382 Asset-backed securities While quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of these securities, valuation models are used to substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices are required.
For ABSs including residential mortgage-backed securities, the valuation uses an industry standard model and the assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as appropriate.
The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature.
Loans, including leveraged finance and loans held for securitisation Loans held at fair value are valued from broker quotes and or market data consensus providers when available.
In the absence of an observable market, the fair value is determined using alternative valuation techniques.
These techniques include discounted cash flow models, which incorporate assumptions regarding an appropriate credit spread for the loan, derived from other market instruments issued by the same or comparable entities.
Structured notes The fair value of structured notes valued using a valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives.
Level 3 structured notes principally comprise equity-linked notes which are issued by HSBC and provide the counterparty with a return that is linked to the performance of certain equity securities, and other portfolios.
The notes are classified as Level 3 due to the unobservability of parameters such as long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity prices, between equity prices and interest rates and between interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives OTC i. e. non-exchange traded derivatives are valued using valuation models.
Valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon no-arbitrage principles.
For many vanilla derivative products, such as interest rate swaps and European options, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry.
For more complex derivative products, there may be some differences in market practice.
Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing.
Certain inputs may not be observable in the market directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical data or other sources.
Examples of inputs that may be unobservable include volatility surfaces, in whole or in part, for less commonly traded option products, and correlations between market factors such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices.
Derivative products valued using valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs include certain types of correlation products, such as foreign exchange basket options, equity basket options, foreign exchange interest rate hybrid transactions and long-dated option transactions.
Examples of the latter are equity options, interest rate and foreign exchange options and certain credit derivatives.
Credit derivatives include certain tranched CDS transactions.

In 2015 movement of Level 3 available-for-sale assets are driven by ABS activity, predominantly in the securities investment conduits.
Transfers out of Level 3 available-for-sale assets demonstrates increased confidence in pricing and price coverage, and transfers in reflect limited availability of third-party prices.
Increase in Level 3 held for trading assets is driven by an increase in recently-issued syndicated loans.
The decline in Level 3 held for trading liabilities reflects a decline in the outstanding balance of Level 3 equity-linked notes, both as a result of market movement and reduced issuance.
The decline in Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities reflects market movement.

The sensitivity analysis aims to measure a range of fair values consistent with the application of a 95% confidence interval.
Methodologies take account of the nature of the valuation technique employed, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data.
When the available data is not amenable to statistical analysis, the quantification of uncertainty is judgemental, but remains guided by the 95% confidence interval.
When the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the above table reflects the most favourable or the most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.
Key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments The table below lists key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments, and provides the range of those inputs as at 31 December 2015.
The core range of inputs is the estimated range within which 90% of the inputs fall.
A further description of the categories of key unobservable inputs is given below.

Private equity including strategic investments Given the bespoke nature of the analysis in respect of each holding, it is not practical to quote a range of key unobservable inputs.
Prepayment rates Prepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date.
They are an important input into modelled values of ABSs.
A modelled price may be used where insufficient observable market prices exist to enable a market price to be determined directly.
Prepayment rates are also an important input into the valuation of derivatives linked to securitisations.
They vary according to the nature of the loan portfolio and expectations of future market conditions, and may be estimated using a variety of evidence, such as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates and macroeconomic modelling.
Market proxy Market proxy pricing may be used for an instrument for which specific market pricing is not available, but evidence is available in respect of instruments that have some characteristics in common.
In some cases it might be possible to identify a specific proxy, but more generally evidence across a wider range of instruments will be used to understand the factors that influence current market pricing and the manner of that influence.
The range of prices used as inputs into a market proxy pricing methodology may therefore be wide.
This range is not indicative of the uncertainty associated with the price derived for an individual security.
Volatility Volatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price, tending to increase in stressed market conditions and decrease in calmer market conditions.
It is an important input in the pricing of options.
In general, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be.
This reflects both the higher probability of an increased return from the option and the potentially higher costs that HSBC may incur in hedging the risks associated with the option.
If option prices become more expensive, this increases the value of HSBCs long option positions i. e. the positions in which HSBC has purchased options, while HSBCs short option positions i. e. the positions in which HSBC has sold options suffer losses.
Volatility varies by underlying reference market price, and by strike and maturity of the option.
Volatility also varies over time.
As a result, it is difficult to make general statements regarding volatility levels.
Certain volatilities, typically those of a longer-dated nature, are unobservable.
The unobservable volatility is then estimated from observable data.
The range of unobservable volatilities quoted in the table on page 387 reflects the wide variation in volatility inputs by reference market price.
The core range is significantly narrower than the full range because these examples with extreme volatilities occur relatively rarely within the HSBC portfolio.
For any single unobservable volatility, the uncertainty in the volatility determination is significantly less than the range quoted above.
Correlation Correlation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market prices and is expressed as a number between minus one and one.
A positive correlation implies that the two market prices tend to move in the same direction, with a correlation of one implying that they always move in the same direction.
A negative correlation implies that the two market prices tend to move in opposite directions, with a correlation of minus one implying that the two market prices always move in opposite directions.
Correlation is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price.
There is a wide range of instruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations e. g. equity-equity correlation and cross-asset correlations e. g. foreign exchange rate-interest rate correlation is used.
In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations.
Unobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices, proxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships.
The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects the wide variation in correlation inputs by market price pair.
For any single unobservable correlation, the uncertainty in the correlation determination is likely to be less than the range quoted above.
Credit spread Credit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality.
In a discounted cash flow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset.
Credit spreads may be implied from market prices.
Credit spreads may not be observable in more illiquid markets.
