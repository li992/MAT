NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
PRESENTATION, CRITICAL The calculation of the Groups current corporation tax ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement with AND JUDGEMENTS respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with Critical accounting estimates and judgements the relevant tax authority.
The Group holds tax provisions in The preparation of financial statements requires the Group respect of the potential tax liability that may arise on these to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts unresolved items, however, the amount ultimately payable reported for assets and liabilities, as at the year-end, and the may be materially lower than the amount accrued and paid amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
and could therefore improve the overall profitability and cash The nature of estimates means that actual outcomes could flows of the Group in future periods.
The measurement of the Groups net trading revenue is In the Directors opinion, the accounting estimates or predominately based on quoted market prices refer to note judgements that have the most significant impact, on the 35 for the financial instrument valuation hierarchy disclosures measurement of items recorded in the financial statements, and accordingly involves little judgement.
However, the remain the impairment of goodwill refer to note 16, the calculation of the segmental net trading revenue, as the useful economic life applied to the intangible assets, the Group manages risk and hedges on a group-wide portfolio recoverability of amounts owed by clients and the calculation basis, involves the use of an allocation methodology.
This of the Groups current corporation tax charge refer to allocation methodology does not impact on the overall Group note 10 b. net trading revenue disclosed.
The judgements in relation to the assessment of goodwill for 2.
UNDERLYING RESULTS impairment largely relate to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the value-in-use of the US cash generating unit The Directors regard the adjustment of exceptional items as CGU.
The US CGU comprises both the Nadex exchange detailed below necessary to provide a greater understanding and associated market making business the Nadex of the results of the Group for the year.
exchange business as well as the wider commercial use of the exchange technology within the Group.
While the Nadex exchange business remains loss making, the wider commercial use of the technology by the Group provides other significant economic benefits, which taken alone support the carrying value of the goodwill.
For this reason, the Directors consider that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would not cause the units' carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
In the event of the Nadex exchange business failing to generate sufficient profits, the deferred tax asset of US$2.8 million held in relation to carry forward tax losses might suffer impairment.
The assessment of the useful economic life of the Groups internally developed and acquired software, licenses, domain name and generic top-level domain based intangible assets is judgemental and can change due to obsolescence as a result of unforeseen technological developments.
The useful life for licences represents managements view of the expected term over which the Group will receive benefits from the software, and does not exceed the licence term.
For internally developed and acquired software and domain assets the life is based on historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their useful economic life.
The recoverability of amounts owed by clients, particularly following the impact of the actions of the Swiss National Bank in January 2015, is dependent on the Groups ability to collect the remaining outstanding amounts from a small number of individually large debtors.
Provisions have been made where the directors consider there is a risk of non-recoverability refer to note 36 ii b.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 117 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 A UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Exceptional items Swiss franc event impact On 15 January 2015, the Swiss National Bank announced that it had ceased intervention in the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and euro.
This caused a sudden extreme appreciation in the value of the franc, accompanied by a lack of market liquidity which lasted several minutes and resulted in a negative financial impact to the Group to a maximum of 30.0 million.
This was from a combination of 11.8 million of market losses and 18.4 million of gross client credit exposures.
The market related losses occurred where client positions were closed in the Groups systems at a more beneficial level than the Group was able to close its entire corresponding hedge due to the market dislocation.
The precise level of the impact on the Groups profit before taxation is partially dependent on the Groups ability to recover client debts.
The recovery of the outstanding debt is dependent on the ultimate recovery from a small number of debtors.
The Groups approach remains that for clients who are considered to be well positioned and with resources to pay their debts the Group will continue to employ resources to recover the debts.

10 E FACTORS AFFECTING THE TAX CHARGE IN FUTURE YEARS Factors that may affect the Groups future tax charge include the geographic location of the Groups earnings, the tax rates in those locations, changes in tax legislation, future planning opportunities, the use of brought-forward tax losses and the resolution of open tax issues.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement with respect to the recognition of deferred tax assets refer to note 10 d and of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The Group holds tax provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise on these unresolved items, however, the amount ultimately payable may be materially lower than the amount accrued and could therefore improve the overall profitability and cash flows of the Group in future periods.

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the cash-generating units CGUs, as follows: Group 31 May 2015 31 May 2014 m m UK 100.0 100.0 Australia 0.9 0.9 US 5.0 4.6 South Africa 1.2 1.2 107.1 106.7 UK goodwill arose on the purchase of IG Group plc by IG Group Holdings Limited on 5 September 2003.
Goodwill disclosed for Australia arose on the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in IG Australia Pty Limited in the year ended 31 May 2006.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Nadex formerly HedgeStreet and the associated exchange technology and licence, and Ideal CFDs has been allocated to the separate US and South African CGUs respectively.
Impairments during the year ended 31 May 2015 There was no indication of an impairment trigger existing on any of the CGUs 2014: nil, nor any impairment recognised during the year ended 31 May 2015.
Impairment testing at year end The goodwill associated with each CGU has been subject to an impairment test at 31 May 2015 as set out in the following disclosures.
For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, the carrying amount of each CGU is compared to the recoverable amount of each CGU and any deficits are provided.
The carrying amount of a CGU includes only those assets that can be attributed directly, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.
The estimated recoverable amount for the UK CGU of 1.7 billion 2014: 1.3 billion is based upon fair value less costs of disposal.
This is 1.6 billion 2014: 1.2 billion in excess of the carrying amount of the CGU.
The estimated recoverable amount of the US CGU, however, is based upon a value-in-use calculation due to the difficulty in determining a fair value for this CGU.
For the US CGU this is calculated as the total of the present value of projected future cash flows and a terminal value.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL CONTINUED Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The UK, Australian and South African CGUs reported a segment operating profit, after the allocation of central costs, of 107.3 million, 34.4 million and 2.3 million respectively for the year ended 31 May 2015 refer to note 4, Segment information.
Furthermore, the UK CGU represents 53% of the Groups net trading revenue for the year ended 31 May 2015.
The Board approved budget for the financial year ending 31 May 2016 and longer-term strategic plans for the Group forecast at least a similar level of performance for these CGUs to continue.
As a result both the single year operating profit and thus the recoverable amount of the UK, Australian and South African CGUs is significantly in excess of the carrying value.
Accordingly, the outcome of the impairment review for the CGUs is not considered to be sensitive to the assumptions used.
The Directors have performed a sensitivity analysis around the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation of the goodwill associated with the US CGU.
The US CGU comprises both the Nadex exchange and associated market making business the Nadex exchange business as well as the wider commercial use of the exchange technology within the Group.
While the Nadex exchange business remains loss making, the wider commercial use of the technology by the Group provides other significant economic benefits which taken alone support the carrying value of the goodwill.
Key assumptions used in fair value less costs of disposal calculations The fair value less costs of disposal of the UK CGU has been calculated using an earnings multiple determined by reference to the Companys quoted market capitalisation and the Groups segmental operating profit.
As the business model of this CGU is largely synonymous with that of the Group, this methodology is deemed to be appropriate.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations Projected future cash flows for the US CGU were based upon the Board-approved budget for the year ending 31 May 2016.
Forecasts to the year ending 31 May 2020 were then extrapolated from the budget using a range of client recruitment, client retention rates, average trading clients growth month on month and revenue per client assumptions.
These were based upon actual amounts measured in prior periods which were projected forward in accordance with expected trends.
This methodology is consistent with that used for the 31 May 2014 year-end impairment review.
The revenue growth rates, disclosed in the following table, are consistent with the long-term growth rates of other of the Groups businesses measured over a five-year period.
The calculation of value-in-use for the US CGU is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Client recruitment and retention rates Average revenue per client The discount rate The long-term growth rate used for the terminal value calculation Cash flows were translated into sterling using year-end exchange rates.
The cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate as disclosed in the table below.
This was derived using a region specific, market-based cost of equity and debt assumption in order to reflect both the financing cost and risk associated with the US CGU.
The long-term growth rate g used in the terminal value calculation of the US CGU is also disclosed below and is equivalent to, or lower than, the respective long-term growth rate for the US economy.
Average years 1-5 Terminal growth rate Discount rate growth rate g Cash-generating unit 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 US 15.81% 16.8% 58% 44% 1.9% 1.9% On the basis of the results of the above analysis there was no impairment of goodwill during the year.

LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The following section provides an analysis of the Groups available liquidity, the liquidity requirements that result from the Groups business model, and sets out the key measures used to monitor and manage the level of liquidity available.
The key measures used by the Group are explained below: Liquid assets: These are the total liquid assets that the Group can access.
These include cash held at bank both own cash and title transfer funds as well as at brokers, the liquid assets buffer held by the Group and other cash amounts due to the Group.
Own funds: These are liquid assets less title transfer funds.
Title transfer funds are client monies held by the Group under a Title Transfer Collateral Arrangement TTCA.
Available liquid assets: Certain of the Groups funds are not immediately available for the purposes of central market risk management as they are required to provide regulatory capital balances in regulated subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Groups overseas businesses also require working capital balances to both fund daily operations and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to fund the local client segregation requirements.
Available liquid assets are therefore liquid assets less all amounts held in overseas subsidiaries and amounts due from segregation each of which are not considered immediately available for market risk management.
Net available liquidity: This is the remaining liquidity available to the Group after the funding of the broker margin requirement associated with market risk management.
Total available liquidity: This measure is the total of the Groups liquid assets and the Groups undrawn committed banking facilities.
In order to mitigate liquidity risks, the Group regularly stress-tests its three-year liquidity forecast to validate the appropriate level of committed unsecured bank facilities held.
On 15 July 2014 the Group completed the renewal negotiations of the liquidity facility with a syndicate of three banks.
In doing so, the Group has maintained the size of the overall facility at 200.0 million.
Of the total committed banking facility, 120.0 million is available for a period of one year and 80.0 million is available for three years respectively from the facility signing date.
The drawings made under the Groups facility in the year ended 31 May 2014 are disclosed in note 19 c. Additionally, the Groups Japanese business, IG Securities Limited, has a 300.0 million liquidity facility as at 31 May 2015 2014: 300 million.
The following notes have been provided to further explain the derivation of liquid assets, own funds, available liquid assets, net available liquidity and total available liquidity.
The generation of own funds is disclosed in note 19 d. | 136 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 19 A LIQUID ASSETS AND OWN FUNDS Liquid assets, stated net of borrowings, and own funds are the key measures the Group uses to monitor the overall level of liquidity available to the Group.
The derivation of both liquid assets and own funds are shown in the following table: 31 May 2015 31 May 2014 Note m m 1 Cash and cash equivalents 18 148.8 101.5 2 Amounts due from brokers 17 239.2 303.9 3.1 Financial investments held at brokers 21 25.3 3.2 Financial investments liquid asset buffer 21 83.1 82.5 4 Other amounts due to the Group 17, 22 27.6 20.4 Liquid assets 524.0 508.3 Less: Drawdown of committed banking facility 5 Client funds held on balance sheet 22 16.9 21.0 Own funds 507.1 487.3 1 Cash and cash equivalents represent cash held on demand with financial institutions please refer to note 18.
2 Amounts due from brokers represent balances with brokers where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions results in an amount due to the Group.
These positions are held to hedge client market exposures in accordance with the Groups market risk management policy.
3.1 During the year ended 31 May 2015 the Group purchased an additional UK Government Gilt which is held at brokers as collateral to support the hedging of client market exposures in accordance with the Groups market risk management policy refer to note 21.
3.2 The UK Government securities held by the Group in satisfaction of the FCA requirements to hold a liquid asset buffer against potential liquidity stress under BIPRU 12.
4 Other amounts due to the Group include balances that will be transferred to the Groups own cash from segregated client funds on the following working day in accordance with the FCA CASS rules and similar rules of other regulators in whose jurisdiction the Group operates.
5 Client funds held on balance sheet include both Title Transfer funds and client monies deposited with the Groups Swiss banking subsidiary.
These are recognised on the Groups statement of financial position with an associated payable to clients.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 137 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 19 B THE GROUPS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS The Group requires day-to-day liquidity for each of: the full segregation of client monies: the funding of regulatory and working capital in overseas businesses: the funding of margin requirements at brokers to hedge the underlying client positions under both normal and stressed conditions: the funding of a liquid asset buffer: and amounts associated with general working capital.
The available liquid assets measure excludes cash amounts tied up in both the requirement to segregate client funds and in the regulatory and working capital of overseas businesses, as they are not considered to be available for the purposes of central market and liquidity risk management.
These requirements are analysed in the following table: 31 May 2015 31 May 2014 Note m m Liquid assets 19 a 524.0 508.3 Less: amounts required to ensure appropriate client money segregation 17, 22 27.6 20.4 1 Less: amounts required for regulatory and working capital of overseas businesses 58.8 28.8 Available liquid assets 437.6 459.1 2 Less broker margin requirement 17 204.8 285.1 Net available liquidity 232.8 174.0 Of which is: 3.1 Held as a liquid assets buffer 21 83.1 82.5 3.2 Drawdown of committed banking facility 1 In the year ended 31 May 2015 the Group made a regulatory capital injection into its United Arab Emirates and Swiss subsidiaries.
The Groups regulated subsidiaries in Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the US all have minimum cash holding requirements associated with their respective regulatory capital requirements.
Additionally, the Groups regulated business or subsidiaries in Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and the US are required to segregate individual client funds in segregated client money bank accounts.
This daily segregation requirement occurs prior to the release of funds from the UK note: market risk management is performed centrally for the Group in the UK in relation to the associated hedging positions held at external brokers.
Accordingly, cash balances are held in each of the overseas businesses in order to ensure client money segregation obligations are met.
Both the regulatory working capital amounts and customer deposits are not available to the Group for the purposes of central market risk management.
2 Positions are held with external brokers in order to hedge client market risk exposures in accordance with the Groups market risk management policies.
3.1 The liquid assets buffer is not available to the Group in the ordinary course of business, however utilisation is allowed in times of liquidity stress and therefore it is considered as available for the purposes of overall liquidity planning.
3.2 The short term banking facility was undrawn at 31 May 2015 and 31 May 2014.
| 138 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 19 C LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is managed centrally and on a group-wide basis.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its broker margin requirements and other financial liabilities when due, under both normal circumstances and stressed conditions.
The Group has carried out an Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA during the year, and while this applies specifically to the Groups FCA regulated entities, it provides the context in which liquidity is managed on a continuous basis for the whole Group.
The Group does not have any material liquidity mismatches with regard to liquidity maturity profiles due to the very short-term nature of its financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk can, however, arise as individual client funds are required to be placed in segregated client money accounts in all jurisdictions with the exception of Switzerland where the entity has a banking licence.
A result of this is that short-term less than one week liquidity gaps can potentially arise in periods of very high client activity or significant increases or falls in global financial market levels.
During periods of significant market movements the Group may be required to fund margin payments to brokers prior to the release of funds from segregation, and in periods of significant market increases or increased client activity, the Group may be required to fund higher margin requirements at brokers to hedge increased underlying client positions.
These additional requirements are funded from the Groups available liquid assets while these individual client positions are open, as individual client funds remain in segregated client money bank accounts.
In order to mitigate this and other liquidity risks, the Group regularly stress-tests its three-year liquidity forecast to validate the appropriate level of committed unsecured bank facilities held.
These facilities were drawn to a maximum of 25.0 million for a period of 7 days in January 2015, 50.0 million for a period of 30 days in March 2015 and 25.0 million for a further 7 days in May 2015.
On all three occasions, the drawdown was to fund relatively high levels of broker margin due to changes in market conditions.
In the year ended 31 May 2014 the facilities were drawn down to a maximum of 50.0 million for a period of 30 days but partially repaid down to 25.0 million for a further 32 days in October to December 2013, and for 30.0 million for 28 days during February and March 2014 following the reduction in available liquidity after payment of dividends and at a time of relatively high levels of broker margin.
As well as the three-year liquidity forecast, the Group also produces more detailed short-term liquidity forecasts and detailed stress-tests such that appropriate management actions or liquidity facility drawdown can occur prior to a period of expected liquidity requirements.
A number of measures are used by the Group for managing liquidity risk, one of which is the level of total available liquidity.
Forthis purpose, total liquidity is calculated as set out in the following table inclusive of the undrawn committed facility.
31 May 2015 31 May 2014 m m Liquid assets 524.0 508.3 1 Undrawn committed banking facility 200.0 200.0 2 Total liquidity including facilities 724.0 708.3 1 Draw down of the committed banking facility is capped at 80% of the actual broker margin requirement on the draw down date.
The maximum available draw down was 163.8 million at 31 May 2015 2014: 200.0 million based on the broker margin requirements on those dates, of which nil was drawn down as at 31 May 2015 31 May 2014: nil.
2 Stated inclusive of the liquid assets buffer of 83.1 million 2014: 82.5 million that is held by the Group in satisfaction of the FCA requirements to hold a liquid asset buffer against potential liquidity stress under BIPRU 12.
Utilisation of the liquid assets buffer is allowed in times of liquidity stress and therefore it is considered as available for the purposes of overall liquidity planning.
The Groups total liquidity enables the funding of large broker margin requirements when required the total available liquidity that can be utilised for market risk management at 31 May 2015 should be considered in light of the intra-period high broker margin requirement of 293.7 million 2014: 290.3 million, the requirement to hold a liquid assets buffer, the continued growth of the business both for client trading and geographic expansion, the Groups commitment to segregation of individual clients, money as well as the declared final dividend for the year ending 31 May 2015, all of which draw upon the Groups liquidity.

LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 19 D OWN FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS The following cash flow statement summarises the Groups generation of own funds during the year and excludes all cash flows in relation to monies held on behalf of clients.
Additionally, both amounts due from brokers and financial investments have been included within own funds in order to provide a clear presentation of the Groups cash resources.
The derivation of own funds is explained in note 19 a, and is stated net of amounts drawn on the Groups committed banking facility.
Anarrative explanation of the key cash flows disclosed in the following cash flow statement is provided within the Operating and Financial Review.

19 E SUBSEQUENT EVENTS As at 31 May 2015, the Group had 200.0 million in revolving credit facility from a syndicate of three UK banks.
The Group has undertaken a review of its contingent liquidity requirements and, upon approval from the Executive Risk Committee, concluded to reduce the facility to 160.0 million and include a fourth bank in the syndicate.
The inclusion of a fourth bank in the syndicate offers the Group further bank diversification.
This new facility has 100.0 million available for up to a 1-year term with an option to extend for a further year and 60.0 million available for up to 3 years and was signed on 17 July 2015 refer to note 39.
A final dividend of 19.70p per share amounting to 71.8 million was proposed by the Board on 15 July 2015.
In the Directors opinion the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet operational requirements under both normal and stressed conditions.
Liquidity management is also dependent on credit risk management subsequently described in note 36 ii.

EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS The Company operates four employee share plans: a Sustained Performance Plan SPP, a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, a Value-Sharing Plan VSP and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, all of which are equity-settled.
The expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share-based payments including associated social security costs was 6.3 million 2014: 7.1 million.
30 A CURRENT SCHEMES Sustained Performance Plan SPP The SPP award was introduced in the year ended 31 May 2014 to replace the VSP award for the Groups executive directors and other selected senior employees.
The Remuneration Committee approves any awards made under the plan and is responsible for setting the policy for the operation of the plan, agreeing performance targets and participation.
The legal grant of awards under the SPP occurs post the relevant performance period.
At the outset of the financial year the Remuneration Committee approves, and communicates to the participants, performance conditions and a pre-defined maximum monetary award in terms of multiple of salary.
The grant of awards, in the form of equity settled par value options, is based upon three performance conditions: Total Shareholder Return TSR, diluted earnings per share and operational nonfinancial performance.
Awards subsequently vest in tranches over the long-term up to seven years, so the participant retains an ongoing substantial stake in the share price performance of the Company.
The following table shows the number of options awarded in relation to performance for the year ended 31 May 2014: Dividend equivalent Expected Awarded Lapsed Exercised awarded Share price full vesting At the start during the during the during the during the At the end Award date at award date of the year year year year year of the year number number number number number number 4 Aug 2014 609.90p 4 Aug 2020 919,119 104,073 200,217 29,220 644,049 Total 919,119 104,073 200,217 29,220 644,049 Of the above SPP exercised during the year ending 31 May 2015, the average share price at exercise was: Award date Average share price at exercise 4 Aug 2014 615.56p The weighted average exercise price of all SPP awards is 0.005p.
As a shared understanding under IFRS2 is established between the Company and participants at the scheme outset, the costs associated with the SPP are accounted for as share-based payments from this time.
Further information on the Companys SPP awards is given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The awards for the current year SPP will be granted post year-end following the approval of actual performance against targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
A ten-day share price averaging period that will commence after the Companys closed period is utilised to convert notional salary awarded into a number of options refer to the Directors Remuneration Report for performance conditions.
The table below details the number of option awards expected to be awarded for the year ended 31 May 2015: Awards expected during the 1 Award date Share price at 29 May 2015 Expected full vesting date year ending 31 May 2016 number 4 Aug 2015 781.5p 4 Aug 2020 504,832 Total 504,832 1 Closing share price on 29 May 2015.
| 146 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP award has been made available to senior management who are not invited to participate in the SPP.
LTIP awards allow the award of nominal cost options, which vest when specific performance targets are achieved, conditional upon continued employment at the vesting date.
For each award a minimum performance target has to be achieved before any shares vest and the awards vest fully once the maximum performance target is achieved.
The awarded LTIP vests after three years with a predefined number of shares allocated pro-rata based on achieving diluted earnings per share growth of between zero and 9% for the awards made in the year ended 31 May 2014, and between zero and 13% for the the year ended 31 May 2015, with straight line vesting in between.
The maximum number of LTIP awards that can vest under the awards made are: Share price Expected At the start of Awarded during Lapsed during Exercised during At the end Award date at award vesting date the year the year the year the year of the year number number number number number 28 Nov 2013 584.00p 28 Nov 2016 437,733 31,321 406,412 5 Aug 2014 618.50p 5 Aug 2017 454,665 8,403 446,262 Total 437,733 454,665 39,724 852,674 The weighted average exercise price of all LTIP awards is 0.005p.
Share Incentive Plan SIP SIP awards are made available to all UK, Australian and US employees.
The Executive Directors have responsibility for setting the terms of the award which are then approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The UK and Australian awards invite all employees to subscribe for up to 1,800 A$3,000 2014: 1,500 A$3,000 of partnership shares, with the Company typically matching on a two-for-one 2014: one-for-one basis.
All matching shares vest after three years as long as the employee remains employed with the Group for the term of the award.
Shares awarded under the scheme are held in trust in accordance with local tax authority rules.
Employees are entitled to receive dividends on the shares held in trust for as long as they remain employees.
The US award invites employees to invest a maximum of 5% of their salary bi-annually to the award.
The award runs for a six-month period and at the end of this period, the employees are invited to purchase shares in IG Group Holdings plc at a discount of 15% to the scheme price, being the lower of the opening share price and the closing share price for the period.
EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS CONTINUED 30 A CURRENT SCHEMES CONTINUED Of the above SIP awards exercised during the year ending 31 May 2015, the average weighted share price at exercise was: Average share Country of award Award date price at exercise UK 28 Jul 2011 598.00p Australia 1 Aug 2011 607.00p UK 27 July 2012 639.77p UK 26 Jul 2013 630.18p Australia 15 July 2013 575.50p UK 27 July 2014 701.50p The weighted average exercise price of all SIP awards during the year ending 31 May 2015 is 605.16p.
30 B FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY-SETTLED AWARDS The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date at which a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement is reached between the Company and the participants.
The weighted average fair value of the equity-settled awards granted or deemed as such under IFRS2 during the year was 8.9 million 2014: 11.2 million.
For SIP awards, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date, without making an adjustment for expected dividends, as awardees are entitled to dividends over the vesting period.
For LTIP awards, the fair value at grant date is determined by taking the share price at grant date.
An adjustment for the present value of future dividends is not required as dividend equivalents are awarded on options granted under the LTIP.
For potential SPP awards made under the Total Shareholder Return TSR criteria, fair value is calculated using an option pricing model prepared by advisers.
For the SPP awards made under the earnings per share and non-financial operational measures the fair value is determined by taking the share price at deemed grant date less the present value of future dividends for the duration of the performance period.
Dividend equivalents accrue under the SPP on awarded but unvested options post the performance period.
Post vesting minimum holding period dividend equivalents cease to accrue on unexercised options.
The inputs below were used to determine the fair value of the TSR element of the SPP awards granted on 12 September 2014: Date of grant 12 September 2014 Share price at grant date pence 599.00p Expected life of awards years 1 1 Risk-free sterling interest rate % 2 IG expected volatility % 19.78% Benchmark index correlation % 18.08% 3 Interim dividend estimate 8.45p 1 Due to minimal exercise price the risk-free rate has no impact on the fair value calculation.

In the year ended 31 May 2014, however, the VSP awards were replaced by the SPP for executives and selected senior management and LTIP awards for other senior management.
VSP awards were conditional awards made available to Executive Directors and other senior staff.
Participants do not pay to receive awards or to exercise options.
The VSP performance period is over three years with a pre-defined number of shares allocated, for each 10 million of surplus shareholder value created over the three-year period above a hurdle.
Half of the shares vest after three years and can be exercised at that date, with the remaining half being deferred for a further year, conditional upon continued employment at the vesting date.
The VSP is based upon two performance conditions, TotalShareholder Return TSR and profit before taxation.
Legacy Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The historic LTIP awards were made available to Executive Directors and other senior staff in the years ended 31 May 2005 to 31May 2010 and were then replaced by the VSP award.
These historic LTIP awards allowed the award of nil cost or nominal cost shares which were legally classified as options and vested when specific performance targets were achieved, conditional upon continued employment at the vesting date.
For each award a minimum performance target had to be achieved before any options vested and the awards vested fully once the maximum performance target was achieved.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting classifications and fair values Group The table below sets out the classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities and their fair values excluding accrued interest.
The Group considers the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities to be a reasonable approximation of fair value and represents the Groups maximum credit exposure without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.
Trade receivables due from brokers represent balances with brokers where the combination of cash held on account disclosed as loans and receivables and the valuation of financial derivative open positions disclosed as held for trading results in an amount due to the Group.
These positions are held to hedge client market exposures and hence are considered to be held for trading and are accordingly accounted for at fair value through profit and loss FVTPL.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard margin trading activities and are reported net in the Group Statement of Financial Position as the Group has both the legal right and intention to settle on a net basis.
Trade payables due to clients represent balances where the combination of client cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions results in an amount payable by the Group.
Trade payables due to clients are reported net in the Group Statement of Financial Position as the Group adjusts the gross amount payable to clients ie monies held on behalf of clients for profits or losses incurred on a daily basis consistent with the legal right and intention to settle on a net basis.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Responsibility for risk management, including financial risks, resides at all levels within the Group, starting with the Board of Directors.
Our Corporate Governance structure, including details of how the Board delegates responsibility for internal control and risk management to our Audit and Risk committees, is described in detail in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.
The Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP and Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA, while applying specifically to the Groups FCA entities, provide an on-going assessment of the risks the Group considers to have the potential to have a significant detrimental impact on its financial performance and future prospects and describes how the Group mitigates these risks subject to the Groups risk appetite.
Financial risks arising from financial instruments are analysed into market, credit, concentration and liquidity risks, and these are discussed below.
i Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
This is analysed into market price, currency and interest rate risk components.
The Groups market risk is managed under the Market Risk Policy on a group-wide basis and exposure to market risk at any point in time depends primarily on short-term market conditions and the levels of client activity.
The Group utilises market position limits for operational efficiency and does not take proprietary positions based on an expectation of market movements.
As a result not all net client exposures are hedged and the Group may have a residual net position in any of the financial markets in which it offers products up to the market risk limit.
The Groups Market Risk Policy incorporates a methodology for setting market position limits, consistent with the Groups risk appetite, for each financial market in which the Groups clients can trade, as well as certain markets which the Board considers to be correlated.
These limits are determined with reference to the expected liquidity and volatility of the underlying financial product or asset class and represent the maximum long and short client exposure that the Group will hold without hedging the net client exposure.
The Groups real-time market position monitoring system allows it to monitor its market exposure against these limits continuously.
If exposures exceed these limits, the policy requires that hedging is undertaken to bring the exposure back within the defined limit.
There is a significant level of natural hedging arising from the Groups global client base pursuing varying trading strategies which results in a significant portfolio hedging effect.
This reduces the Groups net market exposure prior to the Group hedging any residual net client exposures.
Where the Group has residual positions in markets for which it has not been possible or cost-effective to hedge, the Executive Risk Committee determines the appropriate action and reviews these exposures regularly, subject to the risk management framework approved by the Board.
| 156 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 Binary bets and options are typically difficult or not cost-effective to hedge and there is often no direct underlying market which can be utilised in setting the price which the Group quotes.
The Group normally undertakes no hedging for these markets, but can hedge specific positions if considered necessary.
The Group aims to reduce the volatility of revenue from these markets by offering a large number of different betting opportunities, the results of which should, to some extent, offset each other irrespective of the underlying market outcome.
The overwhelmingly short-term nature of these contracts means that risk on these markets at any point in time is not considered to be significant.
A MARKET PRICE RISK This is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument fluctuates as a result of changes in market prices other than due to the effect of currency or interest rate risks.
Equity market price risk: The most significant market risk faced by the Group is on equity positions, including shares and indices which are highly correlated and managed on a portfolio basis.
During the year, following further development of the back-end risk management systems, a detailed analysis of the risk limits market-by-market was undertaken.
This resulted in increasing certain risk limits, as well as making the main regional and global equity limits dynamic by responding intraday when the market is open and most liquid, when client activity increases or decreases and reducing the limit approaching market closing.
Accordingly, the intraday limit will fluctuate but with a maximum limit set at 100.0 million.
At 31 May 2015 the exposure limit was 30.0 million 2014: 20.0 million and the Groups equity exposure was 2.8 million 2014:2.7 million.
The average equity exposure limit during the year was 26.4 million 2014: 18.2 million.
As noted earlier in this section, the Groups market risk policy requires that when the exposure exceeds the exposure limit, hedging is undertaken to bring the exposure back within that limit as soon as practical.
The Group has no significant concentration of market risk.
No sensitivity analysis is presented for equity market price risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups net trading revenue and equity are not significant, being less than the Groups average daily net trading revenue from financial instruments.
Changes in market risk variables have no direct impact on the Groups equity as the Group has no financial instruments designated in hedging relationships.
Other market price risk: The Group also has market price risk as a result of its trading activities offering bets and Contracts for Difference CFDs on interest rate derivatives and commodities that is hedged as part of the overall market risk management.
The exposure is monitored on a Group-wide basis and is hedged using exchange-traded futures and options.
Exposure limits are set by the Executive Risk Committee for each product, and also for groups of products where it is considered that their price movements are likely to be positively correlated.
The exposure to interest rate derivatives and commodities at the year-end are as follows: 31 May 2015 31 May 2014 m m Interest rate derivatives 11.0 11.2 Commodities 7.4 4.7 No sensitivity analysis is presented for other market price risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups net trading revenue are not significant.
Changes in risk variables have no direct impact on the Groups equity as the Group has no financial instruments designated in hedging relationships.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED B FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign currency risk.
i Translational foreign currency risk Translation exposures arise from financial and non-financial items held by an entity with a functional currency different from the Groups presentation currency.
The functional currency of each company in the Group is that denominated by the country of incorporation as disclosed in note 15.
The Group does not hedge translational exposures as they do not have a significant impact on the Groups capital resources.
ii Transactional foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures represent financial assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity.
Transaction exposures arise in the normal course of business and the management of this risk forms part of the risk policies outlined above.
Limits on the exposures which the Group will accept in each currency are set by the Executive Risk Committee and the Group hedges its exposures as necessary with market counterparties.
Foreign currency risk is managed on a group-wide basis, while the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk is not considered by the Directors to be significant.
The Group monitors transactional foreign currency risks including currency statement of financial position exposures, equity, commodity, interest and other positions denominated in foreign currencies and bets and trades on foreign currencies.
The Groups net exposure to foreign exchange risk based on notional amounts at each year-end was as follows: 31 May 2015 31 May 2014 m m US dollar 4.9 2.4 Euro 9.1 1.8 Australian dollar 2.3 0.9 Yen 2.7 8.8 Other 3.9 3.6 No sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk as the impact of reasonably possible market movements on the Groups net trading revenue are not significant.
C NON-TRADING INTEREST RATE RISK The Group also has interest rate risk relating to financial instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.
These exposures are not hedged.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at each year-end was as follows: Between Within 1 year 2 and 5 years More than 5 years Total 31 May 31 May 31 May 31 May 31 May 31 May 31 May 31 May 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Group m m m m m m m m Fixed rate Redeemable preference shares 1 Financial investments 32.9 50.3 75.5 32.2 108.4 82.5 Floating rate Cash and cash equivalents 148.8 101.5 148.8 101.5 Trade receivables due from brokers 239.2 303.9 239.2 303.9 Trade payables client funds held on 16.9 21.0 16.9 21.0 balance sheet 404.0 434.7 75.5 32.2 479.5 466.9 1 Financial investments are made up of 83.1 million 2014: 82.5 million held by the Group in satisfaction of the FCA requirements to hold a liquid asset buffer against potential liquidity stress under BIPRU 12, and a 25.3 million 2014: nil UK Government Gilt which is held at brokers as collateral to support the hedging of client market exposures in accordance with the Groups market risk management policy refer to note 21.
| 158 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Please refer to note 21 for effective interest rates received.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Trade receivables and payables include client and broker balances upon which interest is paid or received based upon market rates.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis A non-traded interest rate risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on net interest income on segregated client funds, based on the value of client funds held at the year-end, on the basis of a 0.25% 2014: 0.25% per annum fall and a 0.5% 2014: 0.5% rise in interest rates, at the beginning of the year, as these are considered reasonably possible.
The impact of such a fall in interest rates would reduce net interest income on segregated client funds by approximately 2.2 million 2014: 1.6 million per annum.
The impact of such a rise in interest rates would increase net interest income on segregated client funds by approximately 4.5 million 2014: 3.3 million per annum.
Changes in risk variables have no material impact on the Groups equity as the Group has no financial instruments designated in hedging relationships.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to perform its obligations, resulting in financial loss.
The principal sources of credit risk to our business are from financial institutions and individual clients.
The Groups credit risk is managed on a group-wide basis.
A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CREDIT RISK Financial institution credit risk is managed in accordance with the Groups Counterparty Credit Management Policy.
Financial institutional counterparties are subject to a credit review when a new relationship is entered into and this is updated semi-annually or more frequently as required eg on a change in the financial institutions corporate structure.
Proposed maximum exposure limits for these financial institutions are then reviewed and approved by the Executive Risk Committee.
As part of its management of concentration risk, the Group is also committed to maintaining multiple brokers for each asset class.
Where possible, the Group negotiates for its funds to receive client money protection which can reduce direct credit exposure.
In respect of financial institution credit risk, the following key metrics are monitored on a daily basis: Balances held with each counterparty group, against limits approved by the Executive Risk Committee: and Any change in shortand long-term credit rating.
The Group is responsible under various regulatory regimes for the stewardship of client monies.
These responsibilities are defined in the Groups Counterparty Credit Management Policy and include the appointment of and periodic review of institutions with which client money is deposited.
The Groups general policy is that all financial institutional counterparties holding client money accounts must have minimum shortand long-term ratings of A-2 and Arespectively, although in some operating jurisdictions where accounts are maintained to provide local banking facilities for clients it can be problematic to find a banking counterparty satisfying these minimum ratings requirements.
In such cases the Group will seek to use a locally systemically important institution.
These criteria also apply for the Groups own bank accounts held with financial institutions.
The Group also actively manages the credit exposure to each of its broking counterparties settling or recalling balances at each broker on a daily basis in line with the collateral requirements.
In addition, the majority of deposits are made on an overnight or breakable term basis which enables the Group to react immediately to any deterioration in credit quality, and deposits of an unbreakable nature or requiring notice are only held with a subset of counterparties which have been approved by the Executive Risk Committee.
At 31 May 2015 there were no deposits held on an unbreakable basis 2014: nil.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 159 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 36.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED B CLIENT CREDIT RISK The Group operates a real-time mark-to-market trading platform, with client profits and losses being constantly updated on each clients account.
Client credit risk principally arises when a clients total funds deposited with the Group are insufficient to cover any trading losses incurred.
In addition, a small number of clients are granted credit limits to cover open losses and margin requirements as described below.
In particular, client credit risk can arise where there are significant, sudden movements in the market i. e. due to high general market volatility or specific volatility relating to an individual financial instrument in which the client has an open position.
We mitigate, but do not eliminate, client credit risk in a number of ways, including the real time monitoring of client positions via our close-out monitor, the ability of clients to set a level in advance at which the deal will be closed the stop level or guaranteed stop level and the use of tiered margining.
Credit risk is also mitigated in part through increased margin requirements on larger positions, our client suitability criteria, and is supported by an extensive training programme that aims to educate clients in all aspects of trading and risk management which encourages them to collateralise their accounts at an appropriate level in excess of the minimum requirement.
The principal types of client credit risk exposure are managed under the Groups Client Credit Management Policy and depend on the type of account and any credit offered to clients as follows: Clients subject to the Groups close-out monitor The close-out monitor COM is an automated liquidation process whereby accounts which have broken the liquidation threshold are automatically identified.
Where client losses are such that their total equity falls below the specified liquidation level positions will be liquidated, resulting in reduced credit risk exposure for the Group.
Both the close-out monitor and client initiated stops result in the transfer of market risk to the Group.
Market risk arises following the closure of the underlying client position as the Group subject to the market risk limits, discussed in the Market risk section with regards to market risk, may hold a corresponding hedging position that will, assuming sufficient market liquidity, be unwound.
In addition a subset of clients has what are known as Limited Risk accounts.
For such accounts a level is set in advance the guaranteed stop level at which the deal will be closed, meaning a maximum client loss can be calculated at the opening of the trade.
Clients placing trades with guaranteed stop levels pay a small premium on each transaction.
The maximum loss is then the amount the client is required to deposit to open the trade, meaning that in most circumstances the client can never lose more than their initial margin deposit.
Although no longer offered to new clients, the Group still has a significant number of clients with this type of account.
This type of account results in the transfer of an element of market risk to the Group, which is managed under the Groups Market Risk Policy, and only a subset of more liquid products are available to trade.
Clients with any type of account may still choose to use guaranteed stops where available and on payment of the premium.
The majority of client positions are monitored on the Groups real-time COM system or are limited risk accounts with guaranteed stop-losses.
As at 31 May 2015, 99.85% 2014: 99.81% of financial client accounts are subject to the automatic COM procedure or are limited risk accounts.
Credit accounts Clients holding other types of accounts are permitted to deal in circumstances where they may be capable of suffering losses greater than the funds they have deposited on their account, or in limited circumstances are allowed credit.
The Group has a formal credit policy which determines the financial and experience criteria which a client must satisfy before being given an account which exposes the Group to credit risk, including trading limits for each client and strict margining rules.
The Group may offer credit limits with the result that any open loss can be paid subject to agreed credit terms.
These accounts typically only create a credit exposure when the clients loss exceeds their initial margin deposit.
In addition to the waiver of payment of open losses on a trade, the Group may also offer clients credit in respect of their initial margin.
This is a permanent waiving of initial margin requirements while the limit is active on the account subject to the credit limit.
Credit limits are only granted following provision by the client of evidence of their available financial resources and credit accounts limits are continuously reviewed by the Groups Credit Department.
Each client with a credit limit is also assigned a liquidation level, breach of which will result in closure of positions.
Credit accounts are small in number, are not actively promoted and in general they are not made available to new clients.
| 160 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 Risk-based tiered margins The Group applies a tiered-margin requirement for equities and other instruments with risk-adjusted margin requirements dependent on several factors including the volatility and liquidity of the underlying instrument.
This has resulted in potential margin requirement of up to 75% of the value of the notional client position for large client positions but a reduced margin requirement for smaller client positions.
These tiered margins, in addition to the COM discussed earlier, contribute to the further mitigation of the Groups client counterparty credit risk exposure.
Management of client collateral The Group also accepts collateral from a small number of its stockbroking clients in the form of shares or other securities which mitigate the Groups credit risk.
Clients retain title to the securities lodged while their trading account is operating normally, but are required to sign a collateral agreement which will allow the Group to take title and sell the securities in the event of the client defaulting on any margin obligations.
The collateral value assigned to the client account is updated in real time, and each security is assigned a haircut value eg a client is typically allowed to use 90% of a major FTSE 100 current market value.
The analysis of neither past due nor impaired credit exposures in the following table excludes individual client funds held in segregated client money accounts or money market facilities established under the UKs Financial Conduct Authority FCA CASS rules and similar rules of other regulators in whose jurisdiction the Group operates.
Under these rules, client money funds held with trust status are protected in the event of the insolvency of the Group.

The Groups approach remains that for clients whom are considered to be well positioned and with resources to pay their debts the Group will continue to employ resources to recover the debts.
Credit risk Company Held within prepayments and other receivables in the Statement of Financial Position of the Company are amounts payable to the Company from related parties that are unrated.
The Company is not otherwise exposed to material amounts of credit risk.
iii Concentration risk Concentration risk is defined as all risk exposures with a loss potential which is large enough to threaten the solvency or the financial position of the Group.
In respect of financial risk, such exposures may be caused by credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk or a combination or interaction of those risks.
The following table analyses the Groups credit exposures, at their carrying amounts, by geographical region and excludes individual client funds held in segregated client money accounts established under the UKs Financial Conduct Authority FCA CASS rules and similar rules of other regulators in whose jurisdiction the Group operates.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCES Capital management The Group is supervised on a consolidated basis by the UKs Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The Groups operations in Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United States, are also regulated.
Individual capital requirements in these jurisdictions are taken into account when managing the Groups capital resources.
The Groups regulatory capital resources management objective is to ensure that the Group complies with the regulatory capital resources requirement set by the FCA and other global regulators in jurisdictions in which the Groups entities operate.
The Groups capital management policy aims to maximise returns on equity while maintaining a strong capital position to enable the Group to take advantage of growth opportunities, whether organic or by acquisition.
The Group does not seek to generate higher returns on equity by introducing leverage through, for example, the use of long-term debt finance.
The Groups 2014 ICAAP was approved by the Board in December 2014.
There have been no capital requirement breaches during the financial and prior year.
The Group also regularly undertakes three-year stress and scenario testing of its main financial and operational risks to project its future capital and liquidity adequacy requirements.
The disclosures required of the Group under the Capital Requirements Regulation Pillar III will be made on the Groups corporate website iggroup.
These will provide additional information which will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on a firms capital, risk exposures, risk assessment process and hence the capital adequacy of the firm.

IMPACT OF ADOPTING NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Restatement of comparatives IFRIC 21 Levies As outlined in the Groups accounting policies on page 168, during the year ended 31 May 2015, the Group adopted IFRIC 21 Levies and has accordingly restated the prior periods.
The following tables reflect the impact on the Groups financial statements at 31 May 2015 of IFRIC 21 Levies at 1 June 2014.

The Group has undertaken a review of its contingent liquidity requirements and upon approval from the Executive Risk Committee, concluded to reduce the facility to 160.0 million and include a fourth bank in the syndicate.
This new facility has 100.0 million available for up to a 1 year term with an option to extend for a further year and 60.0 million available for up to 3 years and was signed on 17 July 2015.
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS The financial statements of IG Group Holdings plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group for the year ended 31 May 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of the Directors on 21 July 2015 and the statements of financial position signed on the Boards behalf by Tim Howkins and Christopher Hill.
IG Group Holdings plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Companys registered address is 25 Dowgate Hill, London, United Kingdom, EC4R 2YA.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and IFRIC interpretations as they apply to the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the year ended 31 May 2015 and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and liabilities including derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and the Company are set out in note 41.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 167 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 41.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 41.1 Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2015.
As permitted by Section 408 1 b, 4 of the Companies Act 2006, the individual income statement of IG Group Holdings plc the Company has not been presented in these financial statements.
The amount of profit for the year dealt with in the financial statements of IG Group Holdings plc is 62.7 million 2014: 85.8 million.
A statement of comprehensive income for IG Group Holdings plc has also not been presented in these financial statements.
No items of other comprehensive income arose in the year 2014: nil.
Comparatives restatement IFRIC 21 Levies Comparative periods have been restated to reflect the impact of the adoption of IFRIC Interpretation 21: Levies.
The adoption of IFRIC 21 impacts the accounting for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS levy for the year commencing 1 June 2014.
FSCS levies are raised in respect of the financial year of the FSCS that runs from 1 April to the following 31 March.
The levy is payable in its entirety if the Group is in operation under its Financial Conduct Authority FCA licence on 1 April, being the obligating event, and is levied relating to revenues of the Groups prior year.
IFRIC 21 requires the levy to be recognised in full in the income statement on 1 April each year.
The existence of relevant activity in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation, neither does the future operation of the business after 1 April result in the charge being spread over the FSCS financial year, this being the previous accounting treatment adopted by the Group.
Therefore, for each financial year presented the levy has been expensed to the income statement in full on 1 April.
Prior year comparatives have been restated under the IFRIC with an equity reserves adjustment recognised for the FSCS levy as at 1 April 2013.
Full detail of the restatement is provided in note 38.
Before the adoption of IFRIC 21, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS levy was recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the IAS 37, Provisions, contigent liabilities and contingent assets.
Presentation in m In presenting the amounts used in these financial statements the level of rounding has been changed from thousands, which were used in the comparative periods, to millions.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 8, this level of rounding does not omit material information.
1 Going concern The Directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis that requires the Directors to have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
41.2 Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of IG Group Holdings plc and the entities it controls its subsidiaries made up to the reporting date as listed in note 15.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The results, cash flows and final positions of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company and are based on consistent accounting policies.
All inter-company balances and transactions between Group entities, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of consideration paid including an estimate of any contingent or deferred consideration.
Contingent or deferred consideration is re-measured at each statement of financial position date with periodic changes to the estimated liability recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
| 168 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 b Non-controlling interests Where the Group and a non-controlling shareholder enter into a forward contract symmetrical put and call options under which the Group is required to purchase the non-controlling interest for its fair value formulae-based valuation, at the forward date, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets, until expiry of the arrangement.
The forward liability is also recognised for managements best estimate of the present value of the redemption amount with a corresponding entry in equity.
The accretion of the discount on the liability is recognised as a finance charge in the consolidated income statement.
The liability is re-measured to the final redemption amount with any periodic changes to the estimated liability recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On expiry of the forward, the liability is eliminated as paid and any difference in the value of the non-controlling interest to the exercise price deducted from equity.
On an  basis non-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of the non-controlling interest is recorded in equity.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling shareholder in a consolidated subsidiarys equity may exceed the non-controlling interest in the subsidiarys equity.
The excess and any further losses applicable to the non-controlling shareholder, are allocated against the majority interest, except to the extent that the non-controlling shareholder has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
If the subsidiary subsequently reports profits, such profits are allocated to the majority interests until the non-controlling shareholders share of losses previously absorbed by the majority has been recovered.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders equity.
41.3 Foreign currencies The functional currency of each company in the Group is that of the country of incorporation as disclosed in note 15 as this is consistent with the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The Groups most significant functional currency is sterling.
Transactions in other currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying spot exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing on the same date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the statement of financial position date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and are taken directly to a translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
41.4 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based upon estimated useful lives.
Estimated residual value and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and residual values are based on prices prevailing at the statement of financial position date.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements over the lease term of up to 15 years Office equipment, fixtures and fittings over 5 years Computer and other equipment over 2, 3 or 5 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 169 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 41.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 41.4 Property, plant and equipment continued An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
The gain or loss arising on derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
41.5 Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition fair value of consideration paid over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is allocated to cash-generating units for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash-generating units represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the statement of financial position as goodwill and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
41.6 Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination such as a trade name or customer relationship is recognised at fair value outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after all the following criteria are met: The projects technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated The availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have been confirmed and The correlation between development costs and future revenue has been established.
Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised over their expected useful lives, as follows: Development costs straight-line basis over 3 years Software and licences straight-line basis over the contract term of up to 5 years Trade names sum of digits method over 2 years Client lists and customer relationships sum of digits method over 3 years Domain names and generic top-level domains straight-line basis over 10 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
In addition, the carrying value of capitalised development expenditure is reviewed for impairment annually before being brought into use.
| 170 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 41.7 Impairment of non-financial assets At least annually, or when impairment testing is required, the Directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists or at least annually for goodwill, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate.
This rate reflects current market assessments of the time value of money as well as the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, although impairment losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
41.8 Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
1 Classification, Recognition and Measurement The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition in accordance with the categories outlined below and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial instruments are disclosed in note 35 to the financial statements.
a Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and financial liabilities classified as held for trading, or designated as such on inception, are included in this category and relate to the financial derivative open positions included in trade receivables due from brokers and trade payables due to clients as shown in the statement of financial position and related notes.
Financial instruments are classified as held for trading if they are expected to settle in the short term.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to hedge derivative exposures arising from open client positions, which are also classified as held for trading.
All financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with gains or losses recognised in revenue in the consolidated income statement.
Determination of fair value Financial instruments arising from open client positions and the Groups hedging positions are stated at fair value and disclosed according to the valuation hierarchy required by IFRS 7.
Fair values are predominantly determined by reference to third-party market values bid prices for long positions and offer prices for short positions as detailed below: Level 1: Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2: Valued using techniques where a price is derived based significantly on observable market data.
Level 3: Valued using techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data that is significant to the overall valuation.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 171 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 41.
1 Classification, Recognition and Measurement continued b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade payable amounts due to title transfer clients.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intend to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
The Groups available-for-sale assets comprise financial investments.
2 Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expired.
a Financial assets A financial asset is derecognised where the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
b Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
41.10 Trade receivables and trade payables Assets or liabilities resulting from profit or losses on open positions are carried at fair value.
Amounts due from or to clients and brokers are netted against other assets and liabilities with the same counterparty where a legally enforceable netting agreement is in place and where it is anticipated that assets and liabilities will be netted on settlement.
Trade receivables represent balances with counterparties and clients where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions result in an amount due to the Group.
A provision for impairment is established where there is objective evidence of non-collectability.
Reference is made to an aged profile of debt and the provision is subject to management review.
Trade payables represent balances with counterparties and clients where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial derivative open positions results in an amount payable by the Group.
41.11 Prepayments and other receivables Prepayments and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the receivables are derecognised or impaired, and when economic benefit is consumed.
41.12 Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, net cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
| 172 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the client money rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA and other regulatory bodies.
Such monies are classified as either cash and cash equivalents or segregated client funds in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements.
Segregated client funds comprise individual client funds held in segregated client money accounts or money market facilities.
Segregated client money accounts hold statutory trust status restricting the Groups ability to control the monies and accordingly such amounts and are not held on the Groups statement of financial position.
The amount of segregated client funds held at year-end is disclosed in note 18 to the financial statements.
The return received on managing segregated client funds is included within net operating income.
Title transfer funds are held by the Group under a Title Transfer Collateral Arrangement TTCA by which a client agrees that full ownership of such monies is unconditionally transferred to the Group.
Title transfers funds are accordingly held on the Groups statement of financial position with a corresponding liability to clients within trade payables.
Cash and cash equivalents also includes client monies deposited with the Groups Swiss banking subsidiary refer to note 18.
41.13 Financial investments Financial investments are held as available-for-sale and are non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as held for trading, designated at fair value through profit or loss, or loans and receivables.
Financial investments are recognised on a trade date basis.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus directly related transactions costs.
They are subsequently carried at fair value.
Fair value is the quoted market price of the specific investments held.
Financial investments available-for-sale are carried at fair value.
Unrealised gains or losses are reported in equity in the available for sale reserve and in other comprehensive income, until such investments are sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until any such investment is determined to be impaired.
On disposal of an investment, the accumulated unrealised gain or loss included in equity is recycled to the income statement for the period and reported in other income.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined using the average cost method.
Interest on financial investments is included in interest using the Effective Interest Rate EIR method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net-carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment, call and similar options but shall not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate see IAS 18 Revenue, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
At the year-end date the Group considers whether there is objective evidence that a financial investment is impaired.
In case of such evidence, it is considered impaired if its cost exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount for a quoted financial investment is determined by reference to the market price.
A quoted financial investment is considered impaired if objective evidence indicates that the decline in market price has reached such a level that recovery of the cost value cannot be reasonably expected within the foreseeable future.
If a financial investment is determined to be impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit for the period.
41.14 Other payables Non-trading financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant.
41.15 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
41.16 Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at their issue proceeds less transaction costs incurred.
Subsequently, taking into consideration the term of the borrowings, an assessment is made whether to state at amortised cost, with any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 41.17 Employee Benefits a Pension obligations The Group operates defined contribution schemes.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as and when they become payable according to the rules of the schemes.
Once the contributions have been paid the group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions.
b Bonus schemes The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on formulae that take into consideration the revenue or earnings attributable to the Groups shareholders after certain adjustments and also based on operational non-financial measures.
c Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when an employment contract is terminated by the Group.
The Group recognises termination benefits when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.
41.18 Taxation The income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and movements in deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates in the respective jurisdictions that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
41.19 Share capital a Classification of shares as debt or equity When shares are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Group is presented as a liability in the statement of financial position: measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
The corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as interest expense in the income statement.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
b Own shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts Shares held in trust by the Company for the purposes of employee share schemes are classified as a deduction from shareholders equity and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
| 174 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 c Share-based payments The Company operates three employee share plans: a Share Incentive Plan and a Sustained Performance Plan and a Long Term Incentive Plan.
Previously the company operated a Value-sharing Plan, that was all equity settled.
For market-based vesting conditions, the cost of these awards is measured at fair value calculated using option pricing models refer to the share based payment note for additional detail of the models and assumptions used for the various award schemes and are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
For non-market-based vesting conditions, at each statement of financial position date before vesting the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions determining the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous statement of financial position date is recognised in the income statement as part of administrative expenses, with a corresponding entry in equity.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of the subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of the employee services received is recognised over the vesting period as an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
41.20 Revenue recognition Trading revenue represents gains and losses arising on client trading activity, primarily in financial spread betting, contracts for difference or binary options as well as the transactions undertaken to hedge the risk associated with client trading activity.
Open client and hedging positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
The policies and methodologies associated with the determination of fair value have been discussed previously under Financial Instruments.
Trading revenue also includes: - spread, commission and funding charges made to clients in respect of the opening, holding and closing of financial spread bets, contracts for difference or binary options: - commission earned from the execution-only stockbroking service after deducting contracting and trade settlement fees payable to third-party brokers.
Revenue is stated net of sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of trade being placed: and - member fees charged by the Groups regulated futures and options exchange.
The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers under the execution-only stockbroking service, does not act as principal when providing this service and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Trading revenue is reported gross of introducing partner commission as these amounts are directly linked to trading revenue.
Introducing partner commission, along with betting duties and financial transaction taxes paid, is disclosed as an expense in arriving at net operating income.
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Finance revenue or interest income on segregated client funds is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
The effective interest rate is the rate which exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income on segregated client funds is disclosed within revenue and therefore operating profit, as this is consistent with the nature of the Groups operations.
Net trading revenue, disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Notes to the Financial Statements, represents trading revenue from financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss and has been disclosed net of introducing partner commission as this is consistent with the management information received by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established.
41.21 Operating profit Operating profit is the sum of the results of the principal activities of the Group after charging depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortisation of intangible assets, operating lease rentals on land and buildings, foreign exchange differences, profit or loss on sale of property, plant and equipment and other administrative expenses.
| IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 175 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 41.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 41.22 Use of non-GAAP measures The Group believes that the presentation of underlying results provides additional useful information to shareholders on the underlying trends and comparable performance of the Group over time.
These terms are not defined under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.
The term underlying refers to the relevant profit, earnings or taxation being reported excluding exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those items of income and expense that the Group considers are material one-off in nature and of such significance that they merit separate presentation in order to aid the readers understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Such items would include profits or losses on disposal of businesses and costs associated with acquisitions and disposals: major restructuring programmes: significant goodwill or other asset impairments: other particularly significant or unusual items.
Other non-GAAP measures used in these financial statements are return on assets refer to note 37, capital resources refer to note 37 and own funds generated from operations refer to note 19 d. 41.23 Finance costs and interest expense on segregated client funds Finance costs and interest expense on segregated client funds are accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal amount charged at the effective interest rate applicable.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the future expected cash flows to the carrying amount of the liability.
Issue costs are included in the determination of the effective interest rates.
Interest expense on segregated client funds is disclosed within operating profit as this is consistent with the nature of the Groups operations.
41.24 Dividends Dividend distribution to the companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
41.25 Operating leases Leases are classified as operating leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users benefit.
41.26 Segment information The Groups segmental information is disclosed in a manner consistent with the basis of internal reports regarding components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, who for the Group are the Executive Directors, in order to assess the performance and to allocate resources to those operating segments.
The Group has therefore determined its operating segments based on the management information received on a regular basis by the Executive Directors of the IG Group Holdings plc Board as they are considered to be the CODM.
Operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 are aggregated.
The Group envisages that the reportable segments may change as overseas businesses move towards operational maturity, breaking through the quantitative thresholds of IFRS 8.
The segments are therefore subject to annual review and the comparatives restated to reflect any reclassifications within the segmental reporting.
41.27 Changes in accounting policies With the exception of the adoption of IFRIC 21, the accounting policies adopted in the preparation of financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups Annual Report for the year ended 31 May 2014.
41.27.1 New accounting standards and interpretations Effective from 1 June 2014, the Group adopted the following interpretation and amendments to standards: a New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group In addition to IFRIC 21 described in Note 41.1, the following amendments to standards have also been implemented but have not had a material effect on the Groups results: IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements effective 1 January 2013 EU endorsed from 1 January 2014 IFRS 11, Joint arrangements effective 1 January 2013 EU endorsed from 1 January 2014 IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities effective 1 January 2013 EU endorsed from 1 January 2014 IAS 27 revised 2011, Separate financial statements effective 1 January 2013 EU endorsed from 1 January 2014 IAS 28 revised 2011, Associates and joint ventures effective 1 January 2013 EU endorsed from 1 January 2014 | 176 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities effective 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation, on asset and liability offsetting effective 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 36, Impairment of assets on recoverable amount disclosures effective 1 January 2014 Amendment to IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement on novation of derivatives effective 1 January 2014 Annual improvements 2012 effective 1 July 2014 Annual improvements 2013 effective 1 July 2014 Amendment to IAS 19, Employee benefits regarding employee or third-party contributions to defined benefit plans effective 1 July 2014 Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments:Presentation on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
This amendment clarifies that the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event.
It must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in the normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
The amendment also considers settlement mechanisms.
The amendment did not have a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
b New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1June 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of the following new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations below, there are no others which are expected to have a material impact: IFRS 9, Financial instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L.
The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling.
There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.
For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests.
It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes.
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Early adoption is permitted subject to EU endorsement.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact.
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 15.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The list below includes those which will have an immaterial impact on the Group: Amendment to IFRS 11, Joint arrangements regarding acquisition of an interest in a joint operation effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38, Intangible assets regarding depreciation and amortisation effective 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment and IAS 41, Agriculture regarding bearer plants effective 1 January 2016 not EU endorsed at the time of going to print Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 regarding the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture effective 1 January 2016 Amendment to IAS 27, Separate financial statements regarding the equity method effective 1 January 2016 IFRS 14, Regulatory deferral accounts effective 1 January 2016 Annual improvements 2014 effective 1 January 2016 | IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 177
