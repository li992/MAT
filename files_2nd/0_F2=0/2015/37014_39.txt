The role of the reporting accountant requires detailed knowledge of the entities involved.
If a firm other than the audit firm were to undertake this work then they would have to spend a significant amount of additional time becoming familiar with those entities.
PwC was therefore chosen to undertake this work as it was considered to be sensible and more efficient both in terms of time and costs.
For the same reasons, certain elements of the SGS work were undertaken by another firm that had performed the most recent audit for those entities.
2014 also included 118,000 in respect of financial due diligence related to the acquisition of intu Merry Hill, intu Derby and Sprucefield.
PwC was chosen to undertake this work on efficiency grounds given the overall assignment, including reporting accountant work on the rights issue.
Additionally, as for all non-audit work, consideration was given as to whether PwCs independence could be affected by undertaking this work.
It was concluded that this would not be the case.

Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year.
The market value of investment and development property at 31 December 2015 includes 144.4 million 31 December 2014: 74.4 million in respect of property considered to be developments.
These are accounted for as investment property and are valued using the same methodology as other investment property with the exception of certain recently acquired development land as detailed on page 122.
122 intu properties plc Annual report 2015 Notes to the accounts continued 19 Investment and development property continued The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset.
All the Groups significant investment and development property relates to prime shopping centres which are of a similar nature and share characteristics and risks.
Valuation process It is the Groups policy to engage independent external valuers to determine the market value of its investment and development property at both 30 June and 31 December.
The Group provides information to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data along with asset specific business plans.
The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to produce valuations see valuation methodology below.
These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed and reviewed with the Groups asset management team and Directors.
The Group engages independent valuation experts to undertake the Groups property valuations.
A summary of the valuers and the value of property assets they have been engaged to value is given below: 2015 2014 m m Cushman & Wakefield 7,132.8 6,823.5 CBRE 1,275.0 1,248.1 Assets not valued externally 62.9 10.0 8,470.7 8,081.6 In addition to the above, investment properties in the Groups joint ventures were valued by Cushman & Wakefield, Knight Frank and Jones Lang LaSalle.
Assets not valued externally, relates to recently acquired development land, the main element being the site in Malga, Spain.
These amounts have been reviewed internally and it has been concluded that the cost of these assets continues to be in line with market values and so no valuation adjustment is needed.
As the developments advance these will be valued by independent external valuers.
Valuation fees are a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers in advance of the valuation and are not linked to the valuation output.
Valuation methodology The fair value of the Groups investment and development property as at 31 December 2015 was determined by independent external valuers at that date other than certain recently acquired development land as detailed above.
The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below.
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date.
These determine the majority of the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation.
The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent review where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.
The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations.
This is based on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property.
The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
Annual property income as disclosed in the table below reflects current annualised gross income.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties.
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield, annual property income and net initial yield are provided in the glossary.
The valuation output, inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to ensure that they are in line with those of market participants.
A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield in isolation, would result in a significant change in the value of investment and development property.
A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase in the total market value of 953 million 31 December 2014: 874 million, while a 50 basis point increase would result in a decrease in the total market value of 748 million 31 December 2014: 718 million.

The Group holds 50 per cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties.
Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property.
The management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of the property.
This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt of a management fee.
Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations.
The principal place of business of both joint operations is England.

Both companies are incorporated in India.
During 2015 Empire, a subsidiary of Prozone, initiated a rights issue to raise INR1.6 billion.
Prozone did not take up its rights and hence its investment in Empire reduced from 61.5 per cent to 34.7 per cent.
The Group took up these unclaimed rights resulting in a 10 million INR1.0 billion, 26.8 per cent direct holding in Empire.
The rights issue was priced at a discount to the net asset value of Empire resulting in a gain of 8.1 million on acquisition which is recorded through the share of profit of associates.
Conversely the carrying value of the investment in Prozone reduced by 2.6 million reflecting that Companys failure to take up its rights and this is also reflected through the share of profit of associates.
As required by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, the equity method of accounting is applied in accounting for the Groups investments in Prozone and Empire.
The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is not available in time for these financial statements.
Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Groups accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined as at 30 September 2015, by independent professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 19.
The market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2015 was INR32 31 December 2014: INR26, valuing the Groups interest at 16.1 million 31 December 2014: 13.0 million compared to the carrying value of 36.4 million 31 December 2014: 38.0 million.
As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value has been undertaken.
The net assets of Prozone principally comprise investment property which is held at fair value in intus financial statements.
As with other Group investment property, it is subject to independent valuation to fair value and that valuation reflects the future cash flows expected to be generated from those assets.
As such the net asset carrying value recorded in the Groups accounts is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of the value in use of the business and so no adjustment to that carrying value is considered necessary.

The Group substantially eliminates its interest rate exposure to floating rate debt through interest rate swaps as described in note 35.
The market value of investment property secured, either directly or indirectly, as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2015 is 9,473.7 million including 1,118.7 million of investment property held within joint ventures 2014: 8,844.0 million including 824.9 million held within joint ventures.
In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.
The Company had non-current borrowings of 353.7 million at 31 December 2015 consisting of a revolving credit facility expiring in 2020 2014: 230.0 million.
This debt is floating rate, secured and its fair value is equal to book value.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings and CMBS is assessed based on quoted market prices, and as such are categorised as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy see note 35 for definition.
The fair values of unlisted floating rate borrowings are equal to their carrying value.
During the year there were no breaches of these conditions see financial covenants section on pages 162 and 163.

At 31 December 2015 the exchange price was 3.4398 per ordinary share.
intu properties plc has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations including payments in respect of the 2.5 per cent bonds and the obligations of the Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company.
Subject to certain conditions, the 2.5 per cent bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or at the Companys election any combination of ordinary shares and cash.
The 2.5 per cent bonds can be converted at any time from 14 November 2012 up to the 20th dealing day before the maturity date.
The initial exchange price was 4.3752 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 22,856 ordinary shares for every 100,000 nominal of the 2.5 per cent bonds.
Under the terms of the 2.5 per cent bonds, the exchange price is adjusted upon certain events including the rights issue on 22 April 2014 and the payment of dividends by the Company.
The 2.5 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Companys option subject to the Companys ordinary share price having traded at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the 2.5 per cent bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled.
If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the 2.5 per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 4 October 2018.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at fair value with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the changes in fair value of financial instruments line.
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of the 2.5 per cent bonds was 326.4 million 2014: 325.6 million, with the change in fair value reflected in note 13.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange.
During the year interest of 7.5 million 2014: 7.5 million in respect of these bonds has been recognised within finance costs.

These were accounted for as equity at their fair value on issue which totalled 143.7 million.
Following the rights issue on 22 April 2014, the conversion price was adjusted to 3.64 per ordinary share.
On 2 July 2014 a conversion notice was issued for all the bonds resulting in 42,394,779 new ordinary shares being issued.
During 2014 interest of 2.9 million was recognised directly in equity.
This is deducted in arriving at earnings per share see note 17.

In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent.
Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Not later than one year 408.3 416.9 Later than one year and not later than five years 1,210.0 1,263.3 Later than five years 1,287.7 1,423.2 2,906.0 3,103.4 The income statement includes 1.1 million 2014: 3.6 million recognised in respect of expected increased rent resulting from outstanding reviews where the actual rent will only be determined on settlement of the rent review.
The income statement includes 11.7 million 2014: 12.0 million recognised in respect of contingent rents calculated by reference to tenants turnover.
35 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Groups treasury department.
The policies for managing each of these risks and their impact on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt is generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps in order to establish certainty over cash flows.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the financial review on pages 46 to 51.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2015 2015 2014 2014 m m m m 1 Borrowings 2,725.1 1,570.4 2,738.4 1,448.6 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 978.0 978.0 943.9 943.9 Net borrowings profile 3,703.1 592.4 3,682.3 504.7 Interest rate protection 86.2% 87.9% 1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and exclude the Metrocentre compound financial instrument and finance leases.
At 31 December 2015 they include the 353.7 million 2014: 230.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility which incurs interest at a variable rate.
Excluding the revolving credit facility, interest rate protection is 94.0 per cent 2014: 93.1 per cent.
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 2.12 per cent 2014: 2.24 per cent.
co. uk Accounts 137 35 Financial risk management continued Unallocated swaps including certain forward starting swaps are excluded from the above calculation.
The nominal value of these swaps is 746.7 million 2014: 746.7 million of which 125.0 million 2014: 125.0 million are forward starting.
Their fair value of 239.1 million 2014: 242.5 million is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 74.1 million 2014: 83.6 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 79.8 million 2014: 90.2 million in the fair value of derivatives.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to ensure the Groups net exposure to foreign currency is less than 10 per cent of the Groups equity attributable to owners of the Company.
At 31 December 2015 the Groups exposure amounted to 7.9 per cent of equity attributable to owners of the Company 31 December 2014: 6.4 per cent.
The table summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk: 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m INRm INRm US$m US$m Net exposure 170.4 87.0 5,421.4 3,819.3 311.1 288.0 The following foreign exchange rates apply to the Groups foreign exchange risk: 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m INRm INRm US$m US$m Foreign exchange rate 1.3568 1.2886 97.5080 98.4238 1.4739 1.5593 The approximate impact of a 10 per cent appreciation in foreign exchange rates would be positive movement of 43.6 million 2014: 32.3 million to equity attributable to owners of the Company.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of 35.7 million 2014: 26.5 million to equity attributable to owners of the Company.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 31.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years.
As at 31 December 2015, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of eight years 2014: eight years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by doing so prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
138 intu properties plc Annual report 2015 Notes to the accounts continued 35 Financial risk management continued The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2015 is 3.7 million 2014: 3.4 million.
It is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.

The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and compound financial instruments.
The Group aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and interest cover.
The Groups stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 4050 per cent range and interest cover to be greater than 1.60x.
At 31 December 2015 the debt to asset ratio remains within the preferred range and the interest cover ratio continues to be above the preferred level.
As the Groups debt is sometimes secured on its interests in joint ventures, these ratios are monitored for the Group including share of joint ventures.
A reconciliation from the relevant amounts as presented to those including the Groups share of joint ventures is presented in the other information section.

During 2014 CPPIB, who held a 49 per cent non-controlling interest in Parque Principado S. r. l. exercised an option allowing them to acquire an additional one per cent holding and certain rights relating to the management of the business.
This has resulted in intu Asturias renamed from Parque Principado, previously accounted for as a subsidiary, being accounted for as a joint venture from that date.
No gain or loss arose on exercise of the option.
