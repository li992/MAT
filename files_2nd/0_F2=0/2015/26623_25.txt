B A S I S OF P RE P A R AT I ON Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and significant policies are provided below.
The impact, if any of new accounting standards and amendments applicable to the year ended 31 December 2015 and accounting standards that are not yet effective are outlined below.
Consolidated group and presentation currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or Man.
The stand-alone Parent Company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included as separate financial statements, starting on page 135.
The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and funding are denominated in United States Dollars USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
The consolidated financial information contained within these financial statements incorporates the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2015 Note 32.
Subsidiaries are entities including structured entities controlled by Man and are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Man until the date that control ceases.
Control exists when Man has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to significant variable returns and the ability to utilise power to affect those returns.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at the acquisition date of assets transferred, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of an acquisition is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at that date.
Costs relating to acquisitions are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
The acquisition date is the date on which Man effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be recognised in the Group income statement and classified as an adjusting item.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager advisor to fund entities.
Man assesses such relationships on an ongoing basis to determine whether each fund entity is controlled and therefore consolidated into the Groups results.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships with fund entities, the directors are of the opinion that, although Man manages the assets of certain fund entities, where Man does not hold an investment in the fund entity the characteristics of control are not met, and that for most fund entities: the existence of independent boards of directors at the fund entities: rights which allow for the removal of the investment manager advisor: the influence of investors: limited exposure to variable returns: and the arms length nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities, indicate that Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and results should not be consolidated into the Group financial statements.
Assessment of the control characteristics for all relationships with fund entities led to the consolidation of nine fund entities for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: five, as detailed in Note 16.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management FUM and the fees earned from the fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability and this information is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 28 and 30.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates The determination of fair values for contingent consideration in relation to recent acquisitions and the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangibles Note 13, whether the Group controls certain funds through its investments in fund products and is required to consolidate them Note 16.3 and classification of adjusting items Note 2 are the most significant areas of judgement and have been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the year.
The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discusses the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on page 59.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 42, together with the significant risk factors pages 34 to 37.
Mans liquidity and capital positions are set out in Note 15 and 23 respectively.
The directors monitor Mans capital and liquidity positions and forecasts throughout the year, and in addition they have approved a budget, medium-term financial plan, and a capital and liquidity plan, which cover the foreseeable future and include rigorous analysis of stressed capital and liquidity scenarios.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group and Parent financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are held at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale.
The directors have also made a longer term viability statement, as set out on page 34.
Financial reporting controls The Groups systems of internal control aim to safeguard assets, ensure that proper accounting records are maintained, and ensure that the financial information used in the business and published externally is robust and reliable.
The Groups systems of internal controls, including financial reporting controls, comply with the FRCs Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
The Corporate governance report is provided on pages 49 to 56.

The Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20102012 and 20112013 Cycle were adopted by Man in the current year, which have not had a significant impact.
There are no new or revised standards and interpretations issued as endorsed by the EU but not yet effective which are expected to have a significant impact on the Group financial statements of Man.
A D JU ST E D P R OF I T B E F ORE TA X Statutory profit before tax is adjusted to give a better understanding of the underlying profitability of the business.
The directors consider that the Groups profit is most meaningful when considered on a basis which excludes acquisition and disposal related items including non-cash items such as amortisation of purchased intangible assets and deferred tax movements relating to the recognition of tax losses in the US, impairment of assets, restructuring costs, and certain non-recurring gains or losses, which therefore reflects the recurring revenues and costs that drive the Groups cash flow.
The directors are consistent in their approach to the classification of adjusting items period to period, maintaining an appropriate symmetry between losses and gains and the reversal of any accruals previously classified as adjusting items.
These are explained in detail either below or in the relevant note.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m Note 2015 2014 Statutory profit before tax 184 384 Adjusting items: Litigation, regulatory and other settlements 8 6 24 Reassessment of the litigation provision 6 Acquisition and disposal related: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 13 92 72 Impairment of FRM goodwill 13 41 Revaluation of contingent consideration 13 62 17 Unwind of contingent consideration discount 9 17 7 Other costs professional fees and other integration costs 8 4 9 Compensation restructuring 7 3 Recycling of FX revaluation to the Group income statement on liquidation of subsidiaries 8 1 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries and other interests 4 Other costs restructuring 8 7 1 Adjusted profit before tax 400 481 1 Tax on adjusted profit 39 46 Adjusted profit after tax 361 435 Note: 1 The difference of $26 million 2014: $27 million between tax on statutory profit and tax on adjusted profit is made up of a tax credit of $15 million 2014: $19 million credit on adjusting items and a tax credit of $11 million 2014: $8 million relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset which is classified as an adjusting item Note 10.
The credit of $6 million to litigation, regulatory and other settlements in 2015 relates to an insurance recovery of prior year costs incurred in association with legal claims, which were included as an adjusting item in previous years, and the 2014 charge relates to legal claims which are partially linked to this recovery.
In 2014 the $6 million reduction in the litigation provision relates to reassessment of potential legal claims Note 19.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles primarily relates to investment management contracts and brands recognised on the acquisition of GLG, FRM and Numeric.
Amortisation charges relating to Numeric of $18 million are included for a full year in 2015, and $7 million relates to the newly acquired Silvermine, NewSmith and BAML fund of funds business intangibles Note 13.
The FRM goodwill was impaired by $41 million during the first half of the year, largely as a result of lower sales and higher redemptions of fund of funds products than anticipated Note 13.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 101 23978 Man AR15.
A D J U S T E D P R O F I T B E F O R E TA X C O NTI N U E D The revaluation of contingent consideration is an adjustment to the fair value of expected acquisition earn-out payments.
The charge of $62 million in the current year primarily relates to Numeric, with a $61 million increase in the contingent consideration creditor as a result of increased management fee margins compared to forecast, as well as higher than forecast FUM due to flows and performance in 2015.
The revaluation credit in 2014 relates to FRM, primarily as a result of lower than anticipated net management fee run rates since acquisition.
The unwind of the discount on contingent consideration in 2015 primarily relates to Numeric $12 million, with the remainder arising from the FRM, Silvermine, NewSmith, BAML fund of funds and Pine Grove contingent consideration, and is included within finance expense Note 9.
Acquisition related professional fees and other integration costs of $4 million relate to the acquisitions of the Silvermine, NewSmith, BAML fund of funds and Numeric businesses.
In 2014 the acquisition related compensation and other costs relate to staff termination, legal and other advisory fees relating to the Numeric and Pine Grove transactions, as well as the costs of integrating our operating platforms.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan, and include payments in lieu of notice, enhanced termination costs, and accelerated share-based payment and fund product based charges.
In 2015, some of the Groups foreign subsidiaries were liquidated, which had accumulated foreign currency translation reserves of $1 million at the date of liquidation.
Upon liquidation of these subsidiaries the related foreign currency translation gain was recycled to the Group income statement.
The $4 million loss on disposal of subsidiaries and other interests in 2014 is the result of the Group selling two of its subsidiaries to local management in May 2014.
Other restructuring costs principally relate to an increase in the onerous property lease provision relating to Riverbank House our main London office and headquarters, as a result of a contractual market-linked rental increase triggered in 2015, consistent with treatment of this onerous lease as an adjusting item upon initial recognition.
In 2014, the $1 million of restructuring costs relates to an onerous lease on our New York property.
R E V E NUE Fee income is Mans primary source of revenue, which is derived from the investment management agreements that we have in place with the fund entities.
Fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of net asset value NAV or FUM and are typically charged in arrears.
Management fees net of rebates, which include all non-performance related fees and interest income from loans to fund products, are recognised in the year in which the services are provided.
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of the funds managed during the year and are recognised when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and has crystallised.
This is generally at the end of the performance period or upon early redemption by a fund investor.
Until the performance period ends market movements could significantly move the NAV of the fund products.
For AHL, GLG and FRM strategies, Man will typically only earn performance fee income on any positive investment returns in excess of the high water mark, meaning we will not be able to earn performance fee income with respect to positive investment performance in any year following negative performance until that loss is recouped, at which point a fund investors investment surpasses the high water mark.
Numeric performance fees are earned only when performance is in excess of a predetermined strategy benchmark positive alpha, with performance fees being generated for each strategy either based on achieving positive alpha which resets at a predetermined interval, i. e. every one to three years or exceeding high water mark.
I N C O M E O R G A I N S O N I N V E S T M E N T S A N D O T H E R F I N A N C I A L I N S TR U M E NT S The net gains on investments and other financial instruments primarily relate to gains on seeding investments.
D I ST R I B U T I ON C O ST S Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2015 2014 Distribution costs 77 104 Distribution costs paid to external intermediaries are directly related to their marketing activity and the investors serviced by them.
The distribution expense is therefore variable with FUM and the associated management fee income.
Distribution costs of $77 million 2014: $104 million comprise investor servicing fees of $74 million 2014: $89 million and product placement fees of $3 million 2014: $15 million.
Servicing fees, which are paid to intermediaries for ongoing investor servicing and are expensed as incurred, have decreased primarily as a result of the continued mix shift towards institutional assets, particularly in the quant alternatives category, and the roll-off of guaranteed product FUM.
Placement fees, which are paid for product launches or sales and are capitalised and amortised over the expected investment holding period Note 14, have reduced due to limited new payments in recent years and the roll-off of amortisation of the previously capitalised balances.
102 Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 23978 Man AR15.
A S S E T S E R V I C I N G Asset servicing includes custodial, valuation, fund accounting and registrar functions performed by third parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds.
The cost of these services is based on FUM, and vary depending on transaction volumes, the number of funds, and fund NAVs.
C OM P E N S AT I ON Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2015 2014 Salaries 158 136 Variable cash compensation 212 174 Share-based payment charge 18 12 Fund product based payment charge 35 30 Social security costs 33 33 Pension costs 6 6 Compensation costs before adjusting items 462 391 Acquisition related costs Note 2 3 Total compensation costs 462 394 Compensation is our largest cost and an important component of our ability to retain and attract talent at Man.
In the short term the variable component of compensation adjusts with revenues and profitability of the relevant business units.
In the medium term the active management of headcount can reduce fixed compensation, if required.
Compensation costs in total are $462 million 2014: $391 million, before adjusting items, or 43% of net revenue 2014: 36%.
Net revenue is defined as gross management and other fees, performance fees, income or gains on investments and other financial instruments, share of after tax profit of associates, less distribution costs.
Salaries and variable cash compensation are charged to the Group income statement in the year in which they are incurred, and include partner drawings.
The increase in total compensation costs is due to the increase in headcount as a result of the Silvermine and NewSmith acquisitions Note 13, as well as inclusion of Numeric and Pine Grove for the full year in 2015, a less favourable hedged Pounds sterling to USD rate in 2015 1.66 compared to the hedged rate in 2014 1.52, and higher GLG performance related compensation.
The compensation structure for the GLG equity long short strategies teams is based on gross profits, which in 2015 were in excess of performance fees generated by the strategies given they started the year below high water mark.
Additionally, compensation costs include an increased year-on-year charge of $5 million as a result of the 2014 change in application of the accounting policy for deferred compensation, which impacts the charges relating to deferred share and fund awards granted from 2015 onwards.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is detailed in Note 22.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end is $49 million 2014: $22 million, largely increasing as a result of the change in application of accounting policy for deferred awards which weights the related vesting expense more in the future compared to previously, which has a weighted average remaining vesting period of 2.1 years 2014: 1.3 years.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 24.

Income and profits are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit was earned in the UK, Switzerland and the US.
The current effective tax rate of 7% 2014: 5% differs from the underlying rate principally as a result of the incremental recognition of a US deferred tax asset of $11 million 2014: $8 million, as detailed on page 106, and the reassessment of tax exposures in Europe during the year, partly offset by the impairment of the FRM goodwill on which no tax relief is received.
The effective tax rate is otherwise consistent with this earnings profile.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profits Note 2 is 10% 2014: 10%.
The tax on Mans total profit before tax is lower than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective tax rate applicable to profits losses of the consolidated companies as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2015 2014 Profit before tax 184 384 Theoretical tax charge at UK rate: 20.25% 2014: 21.50% 37 83 Effect of: Overseas tax rates compared to UK 8 20 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 17 30 Impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items 9 1 Share-based payments 2 3 Recognition of US deferred tax asset 11 8 Other 5 2 Total tax charge 13 19 In the current year the adjustments to the tax charge in respect of previous periods largely relates to the reassessment of tax exposures in the UK and Switzerland.
In 2014 this primarily related to the release of $25 million due to reassessment of tax exposures associated with our Asia Pacific operations.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates expected to be applied when the deferred tax asset or liability is realised.

The deferred tax asset of $59 million 2014: $47 million principally relates to US tax losses and intangible assets of $19 million 2014: $8 million, defined benefit pension schemes of $9 million 2014: $8 million, employee share schemes of $15 million 2014: $17 million, and tax allowances over depreciation of $11 million 2014: $14 million.
The deferred tax asset income statement credit of $8 million 2014: $8 million relates to the recognition of the deferred tax asset in respect of US losses of $11 million 2014: $8 million, a decrease in the deferred tax asset on employee share schemes of $2 million 2014: $7 million increase, a decrease in the deferred tax asset arising on tax allowances over depreciation of $3 million 2014: $4 million and an increase in the deferred tax asset on other temporary differences of $2 million 2014: $3 million decrease in deferred tax liability.
The credit to other revenue reserves of $4 million 2014: $2 million relates to movements in the pension accrual and unrealised cash flow hedge balance.
The Group has accumulated deferred tax assets in the US of $172 million 2014: $191 million.
These assets principally comprise accumulated operating losses from existing operations and future amortisation of goodwill and intangibles assets generated from acquisitions that will be available to offset future taxable profits in the US.
In the prior year, $8 million of these was recognised for the first time, triggered by the acquisition of Numeric, which gave rise to a higher degree of certainty that the US business will earn taxable profits in future periods.
A deferred tax asset of $19 million has been recognised on the Group balance sheet in the current year, representing amounts which can be offset against probable future taxable profits, an increase of $11 million from that recognised at 31 December 2014.
Probable future taxable profits are considered to be forecast profits for the next three years only, consistent with the Groups business planning horizon.
As a result of the recognised deferred tax asset and the remaining unrecognised available US deferred tax assets of $153 million 2014: $183 million, Man does not expect to pay federal tax on any taxable profits it may earn in the US for a number of years.
Accordingly, any movements in this US tax asset are classified as an adjusting item in Note 2.
E A RN I NG S P E R ORD I N A R Y S H A RE E P S The calculation of basic EPS is based on post-tax profit of $171 million compared to a profit of $365 million in the prior year, and ordinary shares of 1,694,081,544 2014: 1,754,177,715, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the period after excluding the shares owned by the Man Employee Trusts.

G O O D W I L L A N D A C Q U I R E D I N TA N G I B L E S C O NTI N U E D Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is carried on the Group balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
Investment management contracts, distribution channels and brand names Investment management contracts IMCs, distribution channels and brand names are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, which are between three and 13 years.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units For statutory accounting impairment review purposes, the Group has identified four cash generating units CGUs : AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric.
Silvermine Capital Management LLC Silvermine and NewSmith LLP NewSmith were acquired during the year, and have been incorporated into the GLG CGU.
The BAML fund of funds IMCs purchased during the year have been allocated to the FRM CGU.

Calculation of recoverable amounts for cash generating units The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGUs are assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation gives a higher valuation compared to a fair value less cost to sell approach, as this would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute products using its well established distribution channels, which may not be fully available to other market participants.
The value in use calculations at 31 December 2015 use cash flow projections based on the Board approved financial plan for the year to 31 December 2016 and a further two years of projections 2017 and 2018 plus a terminal value.
The valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes, after this three year budget period, no growth in asset flows above the long-term growth rate.
In order to determine the value in use of each CGU, it is necessary to notionally allocate the majority of the Groups cost base, relating to operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions, which are managed on a centralised basis.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are represented by the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the three year budget period and the discount rates and terminal value multiples applied to the modelled cash flows.
The assumptions are derived from past experience and consideration of current market inputs.
The value in use calculations are sensitive to small changes in the key assumptions, in particular in relation to the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the three year forecast period.
Sensitivity analysis of this assumption is given in each of the AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric sections below.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31 December 2018 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples to the forecast cash flows associated with management and performance fees.
A bifurcated discount rate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net management fee income and net performance fee income.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with an equity risk premium and an appropriate beta derived from consideration of Mans beta, similar alternative asset managers, and the asset management sector as a whole.
The Numeric CGU value in use calculation, presented for the first time in the year ended 31 December 2015, has been determined on a pre-tax basis.
We consider that this is the most appropriate basis for Numeric given the complexity involved in determining the value of Numerics future tax obligations, given we do not expect to pay federal tax in the US for a number of years Note 10.
The value in use calculations for AHL, FRM and GLG continue to be presented on a post-tax basis, consistent with the year ended 31 December 2014.
The recoverable amount of each CGU has been assessed at 31 December 2015.
The key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs are shown in the table below, and the results of the valuations are further explained in the following sections.

G O O D W I L L A N D A C Q U I R E D I N TA N G I B L E S C O NTI N U E D AHL cash generating unit The AHL value in use calculation at 31 December 2015 indicates a value of $3.7 billion, with around $3.2 billion of headroom over the carrying value of the AHL business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2015 2014: nil.
The valuation at 31 December 2015 is around $0.7 billion higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2014, primarily as a result of increased opening FUM as a result of lower than forecast redemptions and higher performance fees on this FUM base, partially offset by a decrease in alternatives margins as a result of the continued mix shift towards lower margin alternatives products.
The table below shows scenarios whereby the key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, indicating the modelled headroom or impairment that would result.
Each assumption, or set of assumptions, is stressed in isolation.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.

GLG cash generating unit The GLG value in use calculation at 31 December 2015 indicates a value of $900 million, with around $270 million of headroom over the carrying value of the GLG business.
The valuation at 31 December 2015 is around $100 million higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2014, primarily due to a change in FUM mix, with higher opening alternatives FUM as a result of higher sales than previously forecast, which attracts a higher margin, and lower opening long only FUM as a result of higher redemptions than expected.

2 An increase decrease of $19 million.
3 An increase decrease of $76 million.
FRM cash generating unit For the six months to 30 June 2015 an impairment of $41 million was recognised in relation to the FRM goodwill, largely as a result of lower sales and higher redemptions of fund of funds products than anticipated.
The FRM value in use calculation at 31 December 2015 indicates a value of $200 million, with around $50 million of headroom over the carrying value of the FRM business.
Therefore, no further impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2015.
The valuation at 31 December 2015 is higher than the value in use calculation at 30 June 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in FUM due to higher sales than previously forecast, as well as an increase in management fee margins on new sales.
The table overleaf shows scenarios whereby the key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, indicating the modelled headroom or impairment that would result.

Acquisition of Silvermine On 20 January 2015, Man acquired the entire issued share capital of Silvermine, a Connecticut-based leveraged loan manager with $3.8 billion of funds under management at the date of acquisition across nine active collateralised loan obligation CLO structures.
The consideration to Silvermine owners is comprised of $26 million in cash up-front, including $3 million for acquired working capital, and two deferred amounts, payable following the first up to $17 million and fifth up to $30 million anniversaries of closing, based on run rate management fees at the time valued at $15 million.
The deferred consideration payable is equivalent to an earn-out and deemed to be a financial liability measured initially at fair value, with any subsequent fair value movements recognised through the Group income statement.
Values for the acquired business at the date of acquisition are set out below.
Fair value Provisional $m Book value adjustments value Fees and other receivables 4 4 Intangible assets 17 17 Trade and other payables 1 1 Net assets acquired 3 17 20 Goodwill on acquisition 21 Net assets acquired including goodwill 41 Purchase consideration: Cash consideration 26 Contingent consideration 15 Total consideration 41 The fair value adjustments relate to the recognition of investment management contracts of $16 million and brand of $1 million.
These intangible assets are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows generated from the assets and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected lives of five and ten years respectively.
Goodwill primarily represents the increased footprint in the US and a presence within the CLO market, as well as Silvermines skilled workforce.
Acquisition costs incurred as a result of the Silvermine transaction have been expensed and do not form part of goodwill, and are classified as an adjusting item Note 2.

If Silvermine had been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, the pre-tax profit for Silvermine would have been $9.2 million.
Silvermine revenue for the period since the acquisition date is $16.6 million, and if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the revenue would have been $17.5 million.
Acquisition of NewSmith On 24 April 2015, Man acquired the investment management business of NewSmith, an equity investment manager with $1.2 billion of funds under management at the date of acquisition.

Acquisition costs incurred as a result of the NewSmith transaction have been expensed and do not form part of goodwill, and are classified as an adjusting item Note 2.
The pre-tax profit for the NewSmith business since acquisition date is $5 million, which includes management fee revenues of $6 million and performance fees of $4 million.
BAML fund of funds acquisition In April and May 2015 Man made an asset purchase for the BAML fund of fund investment management contracts valued at $7 million.
These are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows generated from the assets and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected life of three years.

O T H E R I N TA N G I B L E S C O NTI N U E D Placement fees Placement fees are paid to distributors for fund product launches or sales.
The majority of placement fees paid up-front are capitalised as intangible assets which represent the contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The amortisation period is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which Man expects to earn economic benefits from the investor in each product, estimated to be five years on a straight-line basis.
The placement fee intangible is assessed for impairment annually.
Amortisation expense, including any accelerated charges arising from redemptions, is included in distribution costs in the Group income statement.
Capitalised computer software Costs that are directly associated with the procurement or development of identifiable and unique software products, which will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as capitalised computer software.
Capitalised computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life three years and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Amortisation of capitalised computer software is included in Other costs in the Group income statement.
C A S H, L IQU ID I T Y A N D B ORR O WI NG S Liquidity and borrowings Total liquidity resources aggregate to $1,586 million at 31 December 2015 2014: $2,263 million and comprise cash and cash equivalents of $586 million 2014: $738 million, excluding $21 million of cash held relating to consolidated fund entities Note 16, and the undrawn committed revolving credit facility of $1,000 million 2014: $1,525 million.
Cash and cash equivalents at year end comprises $250 million 2014: $291 million of cash at bank on hand, and $336 million 2014: $447 million in short-term deposits, net of overdrafts of nil 2014: nil.
Cash ring-fenced for regulated entities totalled $35 million 2014: $24 million.
Liquidity resources support ongoing operations and potential liquidity requirements under stressed scenarios.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
With the exception of committed purchase arrangements Note 30.1, the funding requirements for Man relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
The liquidity profile of Man is monitored on a daily basis and the stressed scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover current requirements and potential requirements under stressed scenarios.
Cash is invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of liquidity.
Accordingly, cash is held in short-term bank deposits and on-demand deposit bank accounts.
At 31 December 2015 the $586 million cash balance excluding cash held by consolidated fund entities is held with 22 banks 2014: $738 million with 22 banks.
The single largest counterparty bank exposure of $100 million is held with an A rated bank 2014: $100 million with an AArated bank.
At 31 December 2015, balances with banks in the AA ratings band aggregate to $239 million 2014: $284 million and balances with banks in the A ratings band aggregate to $293 million 2014: $453 million.
In September 2014 Man issued $150 million ten year fixed rate reset callable guaranteed subordinated notes Tier 2 notes, with associated issuance costs of $1 million.
The Tier 2 notes were issued with a fixed coupon of 5.875% until 15 September 2019.
The notes may be redeemed in whole at Mans option on 16 September 2019 at their principal amount, subject to FCA approval.
If the notes are not redeemed at this time then the coupon will reset to the five year mid-swap rate plus 4.076% and the notes will be redeemed on 16 September 2024 at their principal amount.

C A S H, L IQU ID I T Y A N D B ORR O WI NG S C O NTI N U E D Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of borrowings is $157 million 2014: $154 million.
The committed revolving credit facility of $1,525 million was refinanced during 2015 and replaced with a new committed syndicated revolving loan facility of $1,000 million which was undrawn at 31 December 2015.
The new facility was put in place as a five year facility and includes the option for Man to request the banks to extend the maturity date by one year on each of the first and second anniversaries.
The participant banks have the option to accept or decline Mans request.
The facility is currently scheduled to mature in June 2020.
To maintain maximum flexibility, the revolving credit facility does not include financial covenants.
Disclosures in relation to financial guarantees and commitments are included in Note 30.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the USD against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $2 million 2014: $6 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
This exposure is based on USD balances held by non-USD functional currency entities and non-USD balances held by USD functional currency entities within the Group.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2015 a 50bp increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $2 million increase or a $1 million decrease 2014: $2 million increase or $1 million decrease in net interest income.
In limited circumstances, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with foreign exchange movements.
Where fixed foreign currency denominated costs are hedged, the associated derivatives may be designated as cash flow hedges.
Effective unrealised gains or losses on these instruments are recognised within the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and, when realised, these are reclassified to the Group income statement in the same line as the hedged item.
The realisation of foreign currency operating cash flows and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts generally arise on a monthly basis.
The fair value of derivatives held in relation to the Groups cash flow hedges at 31 December 2015 is $7 million 2014: $15 million.
The Group also hedges its exposure to net investments in foreign operations through forward foreign exchange contracts where appropriate, with any effective gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment reserve within equity.
The fair value of derivatives held in relation to the Groups net investment hedges at 31 December 2015 is nil 2014: $3 million.
Any ineffective portion of these hedges is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included within the income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.

I N V E S T M E N T S I N F U N D P R O D U C T S A N D O T H E R I N V E S T M E N T S C O NTI N U E D Mans seeding investments are included in various Group balance sheet line items.
In summary, the total seeding investments portfolio is made up asfollows: 31 December 31 December $m Note 2015 2014 Loans to funds 16.1 41 94 Other investments in fund products 16.2 224 209 Less those used to hedge deferred compensation awards 16.2 71 68 Consolidated investments in funds held for sale 16.3 119 153 Consolidated investments in funds line-by-line consolidation 16.3 213 Seeding investments portfolio 526 388 16.1.
Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man guaranteed products, which are made to assist with the financing of the leverage associated with the structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The average balance during the year is $75 million 2014: $80 million.
Loans to fund products have decreased compared to the prior year as guaranteed product FUM has decreased together with the associated leveraging.
The liquidity requirements of guaranteed products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 30 which give rise to loans to funds are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the committed revolving credit facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to this credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product at 31 December 2015 is $7 million 2014: $14 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, but our internal modelling indicates that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of A.
Other investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our ongoing business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products to investors.
These seeding investments are generally held for less than one year.
Where Man is deemed not to control the fund, these are classified as other investments in fund products.
Other investments in fund products are classified primarily at fair value through profit or loss, with movements in fair value being recognised through income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the anticipated redemption horizon of the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the NAVs reported by the external valuation service providers are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to these NAVs where the anticipated redemption horizon or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets is disclosed in Note 28.
Investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore this process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products is $170 million 2014: $51 million.
The market risk from seeding investments is modelled using a value at risk methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one year time horizon.
The value at risk is estimated to be $55 million at 31 December 2015 2014: $26 million.
Fund investment for deferred compensation arrangements At 31 December 2015 investments in fund products included $71 million 2014: $68 million of fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can elect to have their deferral in a designated series of Man fund products.
The changes in the fair value of the fund product awards are recognised over the relevant vesting period, which means the compensation expense changes based on the value of the designated fund products.
The fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the value of the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any gains or losses during the vesting period recognised as income or gains on investments and other financial instruments in the Group income statement.
114 Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 23978 Man AR15.
Consolidation of investments in funds Seed capital invested into funds may at times be significant, and therefore the fund may be deemed to be controlled by the Group Note 1.
The fund is consolidated into the Groups results from the date control commences until it ceases.
The Groups seeding investment portfolio has grown during 2015.
In 2015 nine 2014: five investments in funds have met the control criteria and therefore been consolidated Note 32, either classified as held for sale or consolidated on a line-by-line basis as detailed below.
Held for sale Where the Group acquired the controlling stake exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within a year, the investment in the controlled fund is classified as held for sale.
The seeded fund is recognised in the Group balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale, with the interests of any other parties included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
Amounts recognised are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2015 2014 Non-current assets held for sale 188 186 Non-current liabilities held for sale 69 33 Investments in fund products held for sale 119 153 Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when the fund is no longer controlled by the Group, at which time they are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 16.2.
Loss of control may eventuate through sale of the investment or a dilution in the Groups holding.
If a held for sale fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year, and it is unlikely that the Group will reduce or no longer control its investment in the short-term, it will cease to be classified as held for sale and will be consolidated on a line-by-line basis as below.
Two investments in funds which were classified as held for sale in 2014 have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis for the year ending 31 December 2015.
We expect these seed investments will be sold in the short-term.
Management fee income earned from fund entities classified as held for sale was $1 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: $1 million.
Line-by-line consolidation The investments relating to the three funds 2014: nil which are controlled and are consolidated on a line-by-line basis are included within the Group balance sheet and income statement as follows: 31 December $m 2015 Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents 21 1 Transferrable securities 329 Accounts payable 1 Net assets of line-by-line consolidated fund entities 349 Third-party interest in consolidated funds 136 Net investment held by Man 213 Income statement 2 Net losses on investments 16 3 Management fee expenses 4 Net losses of line-by-line consolidated fund entities 20 Third-party share of losses relating to interests in consolidated funds 9 Losses attributable to net investment held by Man 11 Notes: 1 Included within Investments in fund products and other investments.

Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 115 23978 Man AR15.
Structured entities A structured entity is an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights, for example where contractual arrangements are the dominant factor in affecting an investors returns.
Man has evaluated all exposures and concluded that where Man holds an investment, loan, fees receivable, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund or a collateralised loan obligation, this represents an interest in a structured entity.
The activities of these entities are governed by investment management agreements or, in the case of a collateralised loan obligation, the indenture.
The key considerations in assessing whether the Group controls a structured entity, and therefore should be consolidated into the Groups financial statements, are outlined in Note 1.
Consolidated structured entities are detailed in Note 16.3.
Mans maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated structured entities is the sum total of any investment held, fees receivable and loans to the fund entities, and is $303 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: $394 million.

2 Gross management fee margins are the categorical weighted average.
Performance fees can only be earned after a high water mark is achieved.
For performance fee eligible funds, performance fees are within the range of 10% to 20%.
Support by way of loans provided to unconsolidated structured entities is detailed in Note 16.1, and is included within the maximum exposure to loss above.
Furthermore, on occasion Man agrees to purchase illiquid investments from the funds at market rates in order to facilitate investor withdrawals.
Man has not provided any other non-contractual support to unconsolidated structured entities.
Further information about risks relating to investment funds can be found in Principal risks and mitigants on pages 36 and 37.

Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds net asset values are determined.
All fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances are overdue or delinquent at year end.

The $7 million charge for onerous property lease contracts relates to an increase in the Riverbank House onerous property lease provision as a result of a contractual market-linked rental increase Note 2.
Provisions for onerous property lease contracts represent the present value of the future lease payments that the Group is presently obliged to make under non-cancellable onerous operating lease contracts, less the future benefit expected to be generated from these, including sub-lease revenue where applicable.
The unexpired terms of the onerous leases range from one to 20 years.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan.
I N V E S T M E N T S I N A S S O C I AT E S Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control, and are accounted for using the equity method.
In assessing significant influence Man considers the investment held and its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee through its voting or other rights.
Under the equity method associates are carried at cost plus or minus our share of cumulative post-acquisition movements in undistributed profits or losses.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interests in these entities.
An impairment assessment of the carrying value of associates is performed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and any impairment is expensed in the Group income statement.
Mans investments in associates are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2015 Year ended 31 December 2014 Nephila OFI Nephila OFI $m Capital Ltd MGA Total Capital Ltd MGA Total 1 1 % ownership 18.75% 20% 18.75% 20% At beginning of the year 28 2 30 28 3 31 Share of post-tax profit 3 3 9 9 Dividends received 3 3 9 1 10 At year end 28 2 30 28 2 30 Note: 1 18.75% represents Mans ownership of class B common shares.
Mans participation in the profits of Nephila is governed by the share class rights and therefore does not relate proportionately to the ownership interest held.
Man considers that this equity interest, Mans ability to veto Nephilas annual business plan, and the presence of a Man member on the Nephila board of directors provides Man with the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions, and equates to significant influence.
Nephila Capital Limited is an alternative investment manager based in Bermuda specialising in the management of funds which underwrite natural catastrophe reinsurance and invest in insurance-linked securities and weather derivatives, and OFI MGA is a French asset manager.
Both Nephila Capital Limited and OFI MGA have a 31 December year end.
Man has not provided any financial support to associates during the year to 31 December 2015 2014: nil.
Commission income relating to sales of Nephila Capital Limited products totalled $14 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: $15 million, and is included within gross management and other fees in the Group income statement.

All leasehold improvements and equipment are shown at cost less depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life, which for leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement and for equipment is between three and ten years.
2 2. fide F E RRE D C OM P E N S AT I ON A RR A NG E M E N T S Man operates cash and equity-settled share-based payment schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
Details of these schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 64 to 87.
For compensation plans whereby deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, which is remeasured at each reporting date, and equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at settlement date.
During the year, $53 million 2014: $42 million is included within compensation costs relating to share-based payment and deferred fund product plans, consisting of equity-settled share-based payments of $18 million 2014: $11 million, cash-settled share-based payments totalling nil 2014: $1 million, and deferred fund product plans of $35 million 2014: $30 million.
22.1 Employee Trusts The Employee Trusts have the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Man contributed funds, in order for the Trusts to meet their current period obligations in the year, of $37 million 2014: $21 million.
The Employee Trusts are fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury shares for EPS purposes Note 11.
The shares held by the Employee Trusts are deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
The Employee Trusts are controlled by independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of Man.
At 31 December 2015 the net assets of the Employee Trusts amounted to $80 million 2014: $82 million.
These assets include 22,077,638 2014: 21,113,109 ordinary shares in the Company, $11 million notional value options over Man shares 2014: $32 million, and $29 million of fund units 2014: $33 million to deliver against the future obligations.
The shares are recorded at cost and shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.
During the year the trustees of one of the Employee Trusts waived all of the interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 on each of the 21,509,210 ordinary shares registered in its name at the relevant date for eligibility for the interim dividend 2014 interim dividend: waived on all 21,217,345 shares and all of the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 on each of 21,473,372 of the ordinary shares registered in its name at the relevant date for eligibility for the final dividend 2013 final dividend: waived on all 26,925,242 shares.
22.2 Share-based payments In respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards and options at grant date.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based on historical observable data.
Changes to the original estimates, if any, are included in the Group income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

C A P I TA L MA NA G E M E N T Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our business.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant surplus capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of market volatility.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives our business credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of our business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage which allows us to directly align our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory and economic capital, including monthly reporting to the Risk and Finance Committee and the Board.
Mans dividend policy is that we will pay out at least 100% of adjusted net management fee earnings per share in each financial year by way of ordinary dividend.
In addition, Man expects to generate significant surplus capital over time, primarily from net performance fee earnings.
Available surpluses, after taking into account our required capital including accruals for future earn-out payments, potential strategic opportunities and a prudent buffer, will be distributed to shareholders over time, by way of higher dividend payments and or share repurchases.
Whilst the Board considers dividends as the primary method of returning capital to shareholders, it will continue to execute share repurchases when advantageous.
Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares held through the Employee Trusts are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Ordinary shares 3 7 3 7 Ordinary shares have a par value of 3 US cents per share 2014: 3 US cents per share and represent 99.9% of issued share capital.
All issued shares are fully paid.
The shares have attached to them full voting, dividend and capital distribution including on wind up rights.
They do not confer any rights of redemption.
Ordinary shareholders have the right to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at general meetings.
A holder of ordinary shares is entitled to one vote per ordinary share held when a vote is taken on a poll and one vote only when a vote is taken on a show of hands.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, $175 million shares were repurchased at an average price of 195.6p, buying back 59.0 million shares 2014: 68.8 million shares, which had an accretive impact on EPS of approximately 2%.
$1 million of costs were incurred relating to the repurchase, largely relating to stamp duty.
As at 23 February 2016, Man Group had an unexpired authority to repurchase up to 247,247,179 of its ordinary shares.
A special resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, pursuant to which the Company will seek authority to repurchase up to 254,951,571 of its ordinary shares, representing 14.99% of the issued share capital at 23 February 2016.

P E N S I O N BE NE F I T S Man operates 12 2014: 12 defined contribution plans and two 2014: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $9 million for the year to 31 December 2015 2014: $8 million.
The contributions are recognised as pension costs when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements, Man ultimately underwrites the risks related to the defined benefit plans.
These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as members living longer than expected.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK Plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland the Swiss Plan.
At 31 December 2015, the UK plan comprised 91% 31 December 2014: 91% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 123 23978 Man AR15.
P E N S I O N B E N E F I T S C O NTI N U E D The UK Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from Man and managed by an independent set of trustees.
The trustees are responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the UK Plans assets.
Under UK regulations, Man and the trustees of the UK Plan are required to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the UK Plan.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and has committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan is not over funded.
The latest funding valuation of the UK Plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2014 and indicated a deficit of 11million, after including 59 million of assets in the Reservoir Trust.
To remove the funding deficit, Man agreed to make a cash payment of 11.8million to the UK Plan during 2015 along with a further payment in March 2018 of up to 69.0 million from the Reservoir Trust to cover any remaining funding deficit.
Cash contributions of 15.4 million were made to the UK Plan in the year to 31 December 2015 including 3.6 million of top-up payments to the Reservoir Trust in line with the requirements of the Reservoir Trust.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, Man will need to make further contributions.
For the UK Plan, the Group has concluded that it has no requirement to adjust the balance sheet to recognise either a current surplus or a minimum funding requirement on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future for the UK Plan.
For the Swiss Plan, there is a small asset restriction at the 2015 year end.
The Swiss Plan holds some of its assets in an employer contribution reserve, which can be used to reduce the Groups future contributions into the Plan.
As the employer contribution reserve is less than the measured surplus as at 31 December 2015, the surplus has been restricted to the value of the employer contribution reserve.
The UK plan was closed to new members in May 1999, and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the UK plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
In Switzerland, the Group operates a retirement foundation with assets which are held separately from the Group.
This foundation covers the majority of employees in Switzerland and provides benefits on a cash balance basis.
Each employee has a retirement account to which the employee and the Group make contributions at rates set out in the plan rules based on a percentage of salary.
Every year the pension fund commission composed of employer and employee representatives decides the level of interest, if any, to apply to retirement accounts based on their agreed policy.
At retirement an employee can take their retirement account as a lump sum or have this paid as a pension.
In 2015 two changes were made to the structure of the benefits provided by the Swiss Plan, which led to the recognition of past service credits totalling $4 million in the Groups income statement.
The amounts recognised in the Group balance sheet are determined as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2015 2014 Present value of funded obligations 422 438 Fair value of plan assets 471 483 Surplus 49 45 Amount not recognised due to asset ceiling - Swiss plan see above 1 Net pension asset in the Group balance sheet at year end 48 45 Our economic capital model includes capital in respect of a possible deficit in the pension plans.

These mortality tables are assumed to be projected by year of birth with allowance for future improvements in longevity in line with the 2015 CMI projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.25% pa for males and females 2014: in line with the 2014 CMI projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% pa for males and 1% pa for females.
At both 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015 mortality rates in the Swiss plan are assumed to be in line with the Swiss BVG 2010 generational tables.
Illustrative life expectancies are set out in the table below the UK Plan life expectancies are based on the S2NA tables.

P E N S I O N B E N E F I T S C O NTI N U E D The table below illustrates the impact on the assessed value of the benefit obligations from changing the actuarial assumptions.
The calculations to produce the below figures have been carried out using the same method and data as Mans pension figures.
Each assumption has been varied individually and a combination of changes in assumptions could produce a different result.
As at 31 December 2015: UK Plan Swiss Plan Increase in Increase in $m obligation obligation Discount rate decreased by 0.1% pa 6 1 Inflation rate increased by 0.1% pa 2 One year increase in assumed life expectancy 13 1 The duration of a pension plan is the average term over which the plans benefits are expected to fall due, weighted by the present value of each expected benefit payment.
The duration of the UK plan is approximately 17 years, and the duration of the Swiss plan is approximately 20 years.
The assets held by the two plans as at 31 December 2015 are as follows: UK plan Swiss plan $m % $m % Swiss equities 5 12 Non-Swiss equities 7 17 Index linked government bonds 36 9 Absolute return bonds 48 11 Swiss bonds 7 16 Non-Swiss bonds 11 26 Property 7 15 Hedge funds 1 3 LDI 111 26 Diversified growth funds 108 25 Cash 34 8 2 6 Other 2 5 Reservoir Trust fund of hedge funds 92 21 Total assets 429 100 42 100 The plans do not invest directly in property occupied by Man or in Mans own transferable financial securities.
The UK Plans investment strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in government and corporate bonds the latter through the Absolute return bonds holding, and liability driven investment LDI funds.
These are primarily intended to match the movement in the UK Plans funding liabilities, and therefore remove most of the interest rate risk and some of the inflation rate risk on a Technical Provisions basis.
As the Swiss Plan is essentially a defined contribution plan with guarantees, the assets held aim to be at least as much as the total of the member account balances at any point in time.
Member account balances cannot reduce, but interest is only applied to the account balances when sufficient surplus assets are available.
As such there is no specific asset liability matching strategy in place, but if the liabilities the sum of the member account balances ever exceed the value of the assets, the Company will consider how to remove a deficit as quickly as possible.
S E G M E N TA L A NALY S I S The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management businesses.
As a result, performance is assessed, resources are allocated and other strategic and financial management decisions are determined by the Board and the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins, and distribution costs to allow for the analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.

F A IR V A L U E O F F IN A N C I A L A S S E TS L I A BIL I T IE S Man discloses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities using three levels, as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products and other investments Note 16 4 162 62 228 4 167 42 213 Investments in funds relating to consolidated fund entities Note 16 329 329 Derivative financial instruments Note 17 2 2 3 3 4 493 62 559 4 170 42 216 Financial liabilities held at fair value: Derivative financial instruments Note 18 8 8 15 15 Contingent consideration Note 18 206 206 145 145 8 206 214 15 145 160 During the year, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affected the fair value of Mans financial assets and no significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities held at fair value between categories.
For investments in fund products, Level 2 investments comprise holdings primarily in unlisted, open-ended, active and liquid funds, such as seeding investments, which have weekly or daily pricing derived from third-party information.
A transfer into Level 3 would be deemed to occur where the level of prolonged activity, as evidenced by subscriptions and redemptions, is deemed insufficient to support a Level 2 classification.
This, as well as other factors such as a deterioration of liquidity in the underlying investments, would result in a Level 3 classification.
The material holdings within this category are priced on a recurring basis based on information supplied by third parties without adjustment.
Liquidity premium adjustments of $2 million 2014: $2 million have been applied to gated, suspended, side-pocketed or otherwise illiquid Level 3 investments.
The range of liquidity premium adjustments is from 12% to 33% based on the expected timeframe for exit.
A larger liquidity adjustment is applied where the exit is further in the future.
Reasonable changes in the liquidity premium assumptions would not have a significant impact on the fair value.
The fair value of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale Note 16.3 are equal to the carrying values of $188 million 2014: $186 million and $69 million respectively 2014: $33 million, and would be classified within Level 2 $108 million and Level 3 $11 million.
In 2014 non-current assets and liabilities held for sale would have been classified as Level 2.

F A I R V A L U E O F F I N A N C I A L A S S E T S L I A B I L I T I E S C O NTI N U E D The basis of measuring the fair value of Level 3 investments is outlined in Note 16.2.
The movements in Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2015 Year ended 31 December 2014 Financial Financial assets at fair Available-forassets at fair Available-forvalue through sale financial value through sale financial $m profit or loss assets Total profit or loss assets Total Level 3 financial assets held at fair value At beginning of the year 42 42 66 1 67 Purchases 25 25 2 2 Total gains in the Group statement of comprehensive income 9 9 5 5 Included in profit for the year 9 9 5 5 Included in other comprehensive income Sales or settlements 14 14 14 1 15 Transfers into Level 3 Transfers out of Level 3 17 17 At year end 62 62 42 42 Total gains for the year included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for assets held at year end 9 9 5 5 Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2015 2014 Level 3 financial liabilities held at fair value At beginning of the year 145 44 Purchases 23 118 Total charges gains in the Group statement of comprehensive income 79 7 Included in profit for the year 79 7 Included in other comprehensive income Settlements 41 10 Other adjustments At year end 206 145 Total charges gains for the year included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for liabilities held at year end 79 7 The financial liabilities in Level 3 primarily relate to the contingent consideration payable at 31 December 2015 to the former owners of Numeric $164 million, with the remaining $42 million relating to contingent consideration for other smaller acquisitions.
In 2014 these largely relate to the contingent consideration payable in relation to the Numeric and FRM acquisitions.
For Numeric the contingent consideration relates to an ongoing 18.3% equity interest of Numeric management in the business and profit interests of 16.5%, pursuant to a call and put option arrangement.
The call and put options structure means that it is virtually certain that Man will elect to, or be obliged to, purchase the interests held by Numeric management at five call option or five and a half put option years post-closing.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man in respect of the option consideration is capped at $275 million.
The fair values are based on discounted cash flow calculations, which represent the expected future profits of each business as per the earn-out arrangements.
The fair values are determined using a combination of inputs, such as weighted average cost of capital, high water mark levels, net management fee margins, performance, operating margins and the growth in FUM, as applicable.
The discount rates applied are 11% for management fees and 17% for performance fees.
The most significant inputs into the valuations are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2015 Numeric Weighted average net management fee margin over the remaining earn-out period 0.5% Compound growth in average FUM over the remaining earn-out period 12% 130 Man Group plc Annual Report 2015 23978 Man AR15.
F A I R V A L U E O F F I N A N C I A L A S S E T S L I A B I L I T I E S C O NTI N U E D Changes in inputs would result in the following decrease increase of the contingent consideration creditor: Year ended 31 December 2015 $m Numeric Weighted average net management fee margin: 0.1% increase 34 0.1% decrease 34 Compound growth in average FUM: 1% increase 6 1% decrease 6 Increases decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration creditor would have a corresponding expense gain in the Group income statement.
R E L ATE D P A R T Y TR A N S A CTI O N S Related parties comprise key management personnel and associates.
All transactions with related parties were carried out on an arms length basis.
Refer to Note 20 for details of income earned from associates.
Management fees earned from fund entities in which Man holds a controlling interest are detailed in Note 16.
Contingent consideration payable to Numeric management is detailed in Note 28.
The Executive Committee, together with the non-executive directors, are considered to be the Companys key management, being those directors, partners and employees having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities at Man.
The average key management headcount for the year to 31 December 2015 has increased by around 9% from 2014.
Key management compensation is reported in the table below.

F I NA N C I A L G U AR A N T E E S A N D C O M M I T M E N T S 30.1 Committed purchase agreements CPAs For certain structured products, Man has previously made commitments to buy underlying investments in specific fund products at a discount to net asset value, if requested by the fund board directors, to create liquidity.
Man has the option to defer a purchase, if so called, for three months.
The commitment at 31 December 2015 covers investments in existing fund products totalling $19 million 2014: $34 million.
Given the risk and liquidity management at the portfolio level by the investment manager the residual liquidity and market risk to Man from CPAs is not significant.
The stressed liquidity and risk modelling performed across all structured products includes the CPAs and is provided for in our liquidity and risk management framework.
30.2 Daylight settlement facilities Man from time to time provides a guarantee over certain bank accounts of structured product entities to secure daylight settlement facilities which allow for the efficient movement of cash during the trading day.
In aggregate these guarantees had a notional amount of $50 million 2014: $50 million.
Ordinarily no net exposure exists at the end of any given day and the fair value of these commitments has been determined to be nil 2014: nil.
30.3 Intra-day and overnight credit facilities Man guarantees the obligations under a $500 million intra-day 2014: $500 million and $25 million overnight credit facilities 2014: $25 million, used to settle the majority of the Groups banking arrangements.
As at 31 December 2015, the exposure under the intra-day facility is nil 2014: nil and the overnight facility exposure is nil 2014: nil.
The fair value of these commitments has been determined to be nil 2014: nil.
