b Severance provisions Employment terms at some of the Groups operations provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes toan end.
This is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service and based onfinal salary level.
The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the obligation recognised is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated.
The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the severance indemnity obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in other comprehensive income.
The most recent valuation was carried out in 2015 by Ernst & Young, a qualified actuary in Chile who is not connected with the Group.
