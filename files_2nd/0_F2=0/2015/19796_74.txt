Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 34 Lease commitments continued The Group has lease break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions.
These options are exercisable if the Group exercises an existing option to buy back, at market value and at a specified date, either the leased asset or the equity of the other joint venture partner.
No commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Groups discretion.
The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date, therefore minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date.
The current market value of these properties is 4.7bn 2014: 5.4bn and the total lease rentals, if they were to be incurred following the option exercise date, would be 3.9bn 2014: 4.2bn using current rent values.
The lease break options are exercisable between 2015 and 2023.
The additional lease rentals if incurred following the option exercise date would be as follows: 2015 2014 m m 10 Within one year 372 336 Greater than one year but less than five years 1,095 1,045 Greater than five years but less than ten years 1,084 1,257 Greater than ten years but less than fifteen years 1,349 1,611 After fifteen years 3,910 4,249 Total contingent additional lease rentals Operating lease commitments with joint ventures and associates Since 1988 the Group has entered into several joint ventures and associates and sold and leased back properties to and from these joint ventures and associates.
The terms of these sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture or associate at market value: options within the lease for the Group to repurchase the properties at market value: market rent reviews: and 20 to 30 full-year lease terms.
The Group reviews the substance as well as the form of the arrangements when determining the classification of leases as operating or finance.
All of the leases under these arrangements are operating leases.
Operating lease receivables Group as lessor The Group both rents out its properties and also sublets various leased buildings under operating leases.
At the balance sheet date, the following future minimum lease payments are contractually receivable from tenants: 2015 2014 m m 211 193 Within one year 314 256 Greater than one year but less than five years 297 196 After five years 822 645 Total minimum lease receivables Note 35 Events after the reporting period On 20 March 2015 the Group regained sole ownership of 21 stores which were previously held in a joint venture with British Land Co PLC British Land.
The Group received British Lands share of the 21 stores and cash of 96m.
In exchange, British Land took sole ownership of three shopping centres, three retail parks and three standalone stores which were held in two joint ventures between the two companies as at 28 February 2015.
The Group will continue to lease the stores at these sites at market rents which are not subject to RPI-indexed increases.
