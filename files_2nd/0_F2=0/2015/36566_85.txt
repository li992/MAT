In July 2013, Hansteen Jersey Securities Limited issued 100 million of convertible bonds with a coupon of 4.0%.
The bonds will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, be convertible into ordinary shares of the Company.
The initial conversion price was set at a premium of 22.5% above the volume weighted average share price between launch and pricing, and will be subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the bonds.
Bonds can be converted at the option of the bond holder from 15 July 2016.
The bonds may be converted before this date if Hansteens share price expressed in euro at the current exchange rate is more than 130% of the current conversion price expressed in euro at a fixed exchange rate for a period of 20 consecutive dealing days within the 30 dealing days ending on the day before the last dealing day of any calendar quarter.
Bond holders can only exercise their conversion rights in the quarter following the quarter in which the ratio was above 130% for the required period.
Under the terms of the bonds, the Company will have the right to elect to settle any conversion entirely in ordinary shares of the Company, cash or a combination of shares and cash.
If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the bonds will be redeemed at par in July 2018.
