Other deferred tax assets include temporary differences in respect of share based remuneration provisions and financial instruments.
As a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements.
Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences have only been recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the asset to be recovered.
Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unused trading losses of approximately 57m 2014: 80m carried forward at year end.
The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of these losses is approximately 12m 2014: 19m.
Of the unrecognised losses, 27m 2014: 49m will expire if not utilised within 10 years, and 30m 2014: 31m will expire after more than 10 years.
Deferred tax assets of approximately 8m 2014: 13m have not been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences carried forward of 45m 2014: 65m, which can only be used to offset future capital gains.
11 Earnings per share Accounting policy The shares of RELX PLC and RELX NV are regarded as two separate classes of share which together form the issued consolidated share capital of the Group.
In calculating earnings per share EPS of the Group, the earnings for each class of share are calculated on the basis that earnings are fully distributed.
The Groups usual practice is for only a portion of earnings to be distributed by way of dividends.
Until the end of 2015, dividends paid to RELX PLC and RELX NV shareholders were, other than in special circumstances, equalised at the gross level inclusive of the prevailing UK tax credit available to certain RELX PLC shareholders.
The allocation of earnings between the two classes of shares reflects this differential in dividend payments declared, with the balance of earnings assumed to be distributed as a capital distribution, in equal amounts per share.
The UK government has announced that dividend tax credits will be abolished with effect from 6 April 2016, impacting dividends paid after this date.
As a result of the abolition of this credit, from 2016 reported earnings per share will be equal for each RELX PLC and RELX NV share.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted net profit attributable to shareholders by the total weighted average number of shares for the Group.
