No deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
The Group also has carried forward capital losses and the related potential deferred tax asset of 15.5m 2014: 17.2m which has not been recognised.

Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Balance at start of period 7.3 6.8 Increase in allowance recognised in the income statement 1.0 0.5 Balance at end of period 8.3 7.3 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 27.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then sets credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
These credit limits are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers, the Groups policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result the credit quality of period end trade receivables is considered to be high.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, legal action is taken to recover the receivable.
An allowance for impairment is made for any specific amounts which are considered irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
There is also a separate allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 8.3m 2014: 7.3m consists of a specific provision of 3.3m 2014: 2.9m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 4.2m 2014: 3.7m, and a provision of 5.0m 2014: 4.4m based on sales and on the historic default rate.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
4.7m of debts were written off in the period 2014: 4.6m.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 19.4m before bad debt provision 2014: 16.5m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: 99 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m 130 days past due 10.5 8.9 3160 days past due 1.9 1.7 6190 days past due 1.3 1.0 90 days past due 5.7 4.9 Total overdue amounts, excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 19.4 16.5 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short-term deposit, and is available on demand.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in short-term UK Gilts.
They have maturity dates ranging between 1 and 3 months from the balance sheet date.
They return a fixed rate of interest.
The weighted average effective interest rate on the Gilts held at the balance sheet date is 0.3% pa.
These investments are classified as held-to-maturity, and are held at amortised cost.
The directors estimate that the fair value of these investments at the current period end is equal to their carrying value.
Assets pledged as security In the event that the Group were to use its bank facility, it has pledged its trade receivables as security for any borrowing under the facility.
18 OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade and other payables 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Current liabilities Trade payables 85.7 80.1 Other tax and social security 55.9 51.7 Other payables 8.2 6.9 Accruals and deferred income 47.9 47.4 197.7 186.1 Trade payables, other payables, and accruals principally comprise amounts due in respect of trade purchases and ongoing costs.
Their carrying value in both periods approximates to their fair value.
The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 46 days 2014: 46 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 BORROWINGS 100 Total borrowings 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Current assets Bank borrowings net of prepaid fees 0.6 Current borrowings Current portion of finance lease obligations Non-current assets Bank borrowings net of prepaid fees 0.3 Non-current borrowings Non-current portion of finance lease obligations 0.1 Total net borrowings 0.8 Bank borrowings The bank borrowings are repayable as follows: 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Disclosed under current assets: On demand or within one year Less: prepaid issue fees set against borrowings 0.6 0.6 Disclosed under non-current assets: Prepaid issue fees 0.3 0.3 Total bank borrowings, net of prepaid fees 0.9 During the current period the Group replaced its previous 140m committed borrowing facility, which on inception had contained a small loan element as well as an asset-backed lending facility, with a new 140m committed asset-backed lending facility which contains no loan element.
The previous facility had been due to expire in July 2016, and the new facility expires in July 2019.
Because the previous facility contained a loan element, the prepaid issue fees for that facility fell to be capitalised, set against the related borrowings, and amortised over the life of the facility.
These prepaid loan fees were disclosed in the Balance Sheet as part of borrowings, and were analysed into amounts falling due in less than and more than one year from the Balance Sheet date.
On replacement of this facility during the current period, these prepaid fees were written off.
As the new facility contains no element of a loan, the arrangement fees for the new facility fall to be treated as prepayments rather than as borrowings, and to be written back to the profit and loss account over the life of the new facility.
They are included under prepayments in the Balance Sheet, with the element due over one year from the balance sheet date being shown as a noncurrent prepayment.
At the prior period end, there were no borrowings under the facility, and so the only amounts shown under the heading of borrowings were the debit balances relating to the prepaid fees, as shown above.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 As with the previous facility, the new facility is secured on the trade receivables and stock of the Group.
The carrying values of 101 each of these classes of assets is as presented in the balance sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 140m.
There were no borrowings under any facility at either the current or previous year end.
As at 26 December 2015, the Group had available 118m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 27 December 2014: 112m, in addition to the Groups cash and short-term investments as shown on the Balance Sheet.
If the Group were to use the facility, it would carry interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 125 basis points.
20 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS a Overview of all retirement benefit arrangements Defined contribution: auto-enrolment plan The Group operates an auto-enrolment defined contribution plan for employees, in line with recent UK Government legislation.
Under the terms of this scheme, employees make pension contributions out of their salaries, and the Group also makes additional contributions.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this plan in the current period of 3.3m 2014: 2.7m represents the Groups contributions due and payable in respect of the period.
Due to the timing of payments, 0.2m 2014: 0.3m of this amount was unpaid at the period end, but was paid shortly afterwards.
Defined contribution: other plan The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.
The assets of this plan are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This plan began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this plan in the current period of 0.9m 2014: 0.8m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plan Characteristics and risks of the plan: The Group operates a funded pension plan which provides benefits based on the career average pensionable pay of participating employees.
This plan was closed to new entrants from April 2013.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Group, being held in a trustee-administered pension plan and invested with independent fund managers.
The trustee directors of the plan comprise three member-elected trustees, two independent trustees, and three Group-appointed trustees.
All trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plan beneficiaries.
The plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, and market investment risk.
Accounting and actuarial valuation Contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2014 by the plan actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward the results of the 5 April 2014 valuation to 26 December 2015, and has restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
Funding and estimated contributions The Group has an agreement with the pension plan trustees to make additional deficit contributions to the plan over and above the normal level of contributions of 35m per year until 30 June 2017.
The Groups estimated total cash contributions to the defined benefit plan in the 52 weeks ending 24 December 2016 are 47m.
This assumes that our payment to the Pension Protection Fund remains at a comparable level to 2015.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Differences between the defined benefit pension deficit on an IAS 19 basis and on a funding basis 102 As is mandatory under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group values its pension deficit in these accounts on an IAS19 basis.
As shown below, the IAS19 deficit at the current period end is 49.2m.
On a funding basis also known as a Technical Provisions basis, being the basis on which the triennial actuarial valuations are carried out, the funding deficit at the current period end is estimated at 167.6m, this estimate being based on an approximate roll-forward of the 2014 triennial funding valuation, updated for market conditions.
French post-employment benefits As explained in more detail in note 21, we recognised a provision in 2014 for a post-employment benefit which is payable to employees in our French subsidiaries under French law on retirement.
It is a lump sum payable on retirement, not a recurring pension.
As such, there is no underlying pension plan.
There is no additional liability to recognise in 2015. b Total amounts credited charged in respect of pensions in the period 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Charged to the income statement: Defined benefit plan current service cost 16.2 12.4 Defined benefit plan administration costs 1.6 1.7 Defined benefit plan total operating charge 17.8 14.1 Defined benefit plan net finance charge 4.1 1.5 Defined contribution plans total operating charge 4.2 3.5 French post-employment benefits charge in period 0.2 Total net amount charged to profit before tax 26.1 19.3 Credited charged to equity: Defined benefit plan net actuarial gains losses, net of deferred tax 46.7 95.7 Total credit charge 20.6 115.0 c Other information defined benefit pension plan 52 weeks to 52 weeks to Key assumptions used in the valuation of the plan 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment capped at lower of CPI and 5% 2.05% 2.15% Rate of CARE revaluation capped at lower of RPI and 3% 2.40% 2.45% Rate of increase of pensions in payment: pensions with increases capped at lower of CPI and 5% 2.50% 2.45% pensions with increases capped at lower of CPI and 5%, with a 3% minimum 3.65% 3.55% pensions with increases capped at the lower of LPI and 2.5% 2.25% 2.25% Rate of increase in salaries 4.50% 4.45% Inflation assumption RPI 3.50% 3.45% Inflation assumption CPI 2.50% 2.45% Discount rate 3.75% 3.50% The following mortality tables were used: Mortality before retirement 2014 and 2015: Males AMC00 Ultimate Females AFC00 Ultimate Mortality in retirement for current S2PFA females S2PMA males, with an application of scaling factors and future pensioners 2015: dependent on members socio-economic information and an allowance for future improvements in line with CMI 2013 core projections with a long-term rate of 1.75% Mortality in retirement for current S1PFA females S1PMA males, with an application of scaling factors and future pensioners 2014: dependent on members socio-economic information and an allowance for future improvements in line with CMI 2010 core projections with a long-term rate of 1.5% Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The mortality assumption adopted by the Group in 2014 and 2015 is equivalent to the following life expectancies: 103 2015 2014 Male yrs Female yrs Male yrs Female yrs Non-pensioner age 45 89.4 92.2 89.5 91.8 Pensioner age 65 87.8 89.3 88.6 89.6 Sensitivities If there was an increase decrease in the discount rate of 0.25%, there would be a corresponding decrease increase in the scheme liabilities of around 4.7%, or 50m, and a decrease increase in the total service cost of around 5.4% or 0.9m.
An increase of 0.25% to the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by around 27m, or 2.6%, and would increase total service cost by around 0.4m or 2.4%.
A decrease of 0.25% to the inflation rate would decrease scheme liabilities by around 28m, or 2.7%, and would decrease total service cost by around 0.4m or 2.4%.
The effect of an increase in inflation is not the exact equal and opposite of the effect of a decrease in inflation because of the effect of various caps and collars on various tranches of pension benefits for instance, some pension increases are capped at the lower of LPI and 2.5%, as noted above.
The effect of increasing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 2% or 21m, and would increase total service cost by around 0.3m or 1.8%.
The sensitivities above are applied to the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision at note 3.
The amount of the expected future cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities.
The timing of outflows from the provision is variable, and is dependent on property lease expiry dates, on opportunities to surrender leases, and on the timing of dilapidations assessments and works.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 107 Warranty provision The warranty provision relates to amounts due in respect of product warranties.
As products are sold, the Group makes provision for claims under warranties.
As claims are made, the Group utilises the provision and then uses this historical data to periodically revise the basis on which it makes further provision.
French post-employment benefits This provision relates to a benefit which is payable to employees in our French subsidiaries under French law on retirement.
It will only be payable if any of the eligible employees are employed by our French subsidiaries immediately before their retirement.
The provision represents our best estimate of the potential liability and it is calculated based on several factors, mainly the age profile and salary details of the current workforce in France, and the current rate of staff turnover.

Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 117 a Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to maximise the return to shareholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance, trading-off the benefits of financial leverage with the expected future costs of financial distress.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and short-term investments, the committed borrowing facility discussed further in note 19 if needed and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent including issued share capital and reserves as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and in note 22.
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure regularly, including, but not limited to, at the time of preparing annual budgets, preparing three-year corporate plans, and considering corporate transactions.
As part of this review, the Board reviews the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs, taking on or issuing new debt or repaying any existing debt.
At the period end, the Group had a 140m committed bank facility secured against the assets of the Group and based on two sub-facilities stock and trade receivables.
The facility limit is the lower of 140m and the sum of the sub-facilities.
Under the terms of the facility, none of the Groups principal subsidiary companies can sign up to additional secured borrowings, other than those expressly permitted within the terms of the facility.
The facility i permits normal trade credit granted to it in the ordinary course of business: ii allows up to 10m of additional secured borrowings, and iii allows up to 20m of finance lease borrowing.
During the period the maturity of the facility was extended from July 2016 to July 2019. b Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
c Categories of financial instruments 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Financial assets current and non-current Trade receivables 97.1 102.9 Cash and cash equivalents 166.1 131.9 Current asset investments 60.0 85.0 Financial liabilities current and non-current Trade payables 85.7 80.1 Borrowings 0.8 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued d Financial risk management 118 General The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
The Board has approved and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed, and the quantification of the level of exposure in the balance sheet is shown below subcategorised into credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee.
In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group Treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group Treasury regularly reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying and evaluating financial risks.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual bank deposit or lending arrangements with counterparties that have appropriate credit ratings, as detailed in section e below.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents, which is the term used in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, as defined immediately above, together with any overdrafts repayable on demand and current asset investments.
Arrangements are in place to ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
The prime consideration in the investment of cash balances is the security of the asset, followed by liquidity and then yield.
Current asset investments consist of UK Government Treasury Bills with an initial term to maturity of up to three months.
These investments are held to maturity and, whilst of lower liquidity than cash, will ensure that the primary Group policy objective of asset security is met.
Management of trade receivables is discussed in note 17. e Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash, investments, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in the accounting policies and in note 17.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and investments through adherence to a policy of minimum short-term counterparty credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies Standard & Poors A-1 and Moodys P-1.
However, when accounts are opened in new territories there may be instances where there is no appropriate partner which meets the Groups credit rating conditions.
In such circumstances, arrangements with a counterparty which does not meet the Groups credit rating criteria can be made only at the specific approval of the Board and is subject to a maximum cash holding limit.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 In addition, Group Treasury monitors counterparty risk through regular assesments which take account of counterparties 119 key financial ratios, corporate bond and equity prices together with agency credit ratings.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 97.1 102.9 Cash 166.1 131.9 Current asset investments 60.0 85.0 Total credit risk exposure 323.2 319.8 f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient cash and investment reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities as far as is possible.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
In addition, the Financial Review contains a section describing the interaction of liquidity risk and the going concern review.
Maturity profile of outstanding financial liabilities The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
Within 1 year 23 years Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Capital interest interest Capital interest interest Total At 26 December 2015 m m m m m m m Trade payables 85.7 85.7 Within 1 year 23 years Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Capital interest interest Capital interest interest Total At 27 December 2014 m m m m m m m Trade payables 80.1 80.1 Finance leases 0.1 0.1 80.1 0.1 80.2 Note: it has been assumed that, where applicable, interest and foreign currency exchange rates prevailing at the reporting balance sheet date will not vary over the time periods remaining for future cash flows.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued g Market risk 120 This is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate owing to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, from non-Sterling revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to currency risk is as follows: 26 December 2015 27 December 2014 m m Euro Trade receivables 1.8 1.6 Other receivables 1.4 0.8 Cash and cash equivalents 4.2 4.4 Trade payables 13.2 16.5 Other payables 0.8 0.8 6.6 10.5 US Dollar Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 Trade payables 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.8 TOTAL 7.2 11.3 Interest rate risk The Group does not have any significant exposure to interest rate risk.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 h Financial instrument sensitivities 121 Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points increase is used as this represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit and profit and loss reserve would remain the same 2014: remain the same.
For a decrease of 50 basis points, the current year figures would remain the same 2014: remain the same.
Foreign exchange sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro, and US dollar exchange rates.
The following information details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in pounds Sterling against the Euro, and the US Dollar.

All discontinued operations in the prior period are discontinued exceptional items, and are analysed as follows: 52 weeks to 27 December 2014 Note m Increase to discontinued operations property provision a 2.2 Release of discontinued interest accrual b 0.1 Exceptional item loss on discontinued operations 2.1 Release of tax creditor for discontinued operations c 11.1 Tax credit on increase to discontinued operations property provision a 0.1 Exceptional profit after tax 9.1 a Increase to discontinued property provisions During 2014, we increased the provision for our remaining legacy properties.
b Release of discontinued interest accrual In periods prior to 2014, the Group had been accruing for possible interest which would be due in relation to overdue tax in the event that we were unsuccessful in our dispute with HMRC relating to discontinued operations see c below.
Following the partial resolution of this dispute in the period, we had certainty that some of this accrual would no longer be needed.
We therefore released this amount.
c Release of tax creditor for discontinued operations During 2014, we received a First Tier Tribunal judgement which gave a partial resolution of a dispute with HMRC, regarding the tax treatment of certain expenses relating to our legacy properties which had been incurred in prior periods.
In prior years, we had prepared our tax computations for accounts purposes on the basis that the disputed expense items would not be deductible for tax, and we provided for tax on that basis.
Since the judgement gave us certainty that particular expenses may be treated as deductible for tax, we recognised a credit of 11.1m of tax in 2014.
