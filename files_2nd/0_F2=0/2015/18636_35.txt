Acquisition transaction costs, release of fair value adjustments to inventory and adjustments to contingent consideration collectively acquisition items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Segment profit, before these acquisition items and the other adjustments, is disclosed separately above as this is the measure reported to the Chief Executive for the purpose of allocation of resources and assessment of segment performance.
These adjustments are analysed as follows: 2015 Acquisition items Total Release of amortisation Amortisation Adjustments fair value charge and Disposal of of acquired Transaction to contingent adjustments acquisition operations intangible items note 29 assets costs consideration to inventory Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 3,026 928 538 4,492 4,492 Process Safety Infrastructure Safety 765 486 102 130 1,483 1,076 407 12,156 21 1,581 13,758 354 13,404 Medical Environmental & Analysis 4,007 2,303 1,704 1,704 Total Segment & Group 19,954 1,435 620 668 21,437 1,430 20,007 The transaction costs arose mainly on the acquisitions see note 24 of Rohrback Cosasco Systems Inc. RCS, Advanced Electronics Limited Advanced and Plasticspritzerei AG, which were acquired on 30 May 2014, 14 May 2014 and 2 May 2014 respectively.
The charge of 1,581,000 to contingent consideration related mainly to a revision in the estimate of the remaining MST payable from $6,504,000 to $9,061,000.
The 2,303,000 credit to contingent consideration related to a revision in the estimate of the remaining ASL payable from 2,500,000 to 197,000.
The release of fair value adjustments to inventory arises from revaluing the inventory of RCS and Advanced at acquisition.

Information about major customers The Group had no revenue from a single customer, which accounts for more than 2% of the Groups revenue.
2 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,328,541 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares 2014: 377,805,248.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,475,804 shares 2014: 378,035,662, which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of 147,263 2014: 230,414.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets: acquisition items: profit or loss on disposal of operations: the effects of closure to future benefit accrual of the defined benefit pension plans net of associated costs prior year only : and the associated taxation thereon.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.

The effect of acquisitions made during the financial year has been equalised by adjusting the current year results for pro-rated contributions based on their revenues and profits before taxation at the dates of acquisition.
The results of disposals made in the financial year have been adjusted from the prior year reported revenue and profit before taxation.
The effects of currency changes are removed through restating the current year revenue and profit before taxation at the prior year exchange rates.

Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Process Safety Gas Detection Bursting Discs 7,826 6,977 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 51,826 7,357 59,652 14,334 Infrastructure Safety Fire 22,711 12,172 Doors, Security and Elevators 63,912 68,465 86,623 80,637 Medical Health Optics 125,581 117,571 Fluid Technology 34,746 31,095 160,327 148,666 Environmental & Analysis Water 28,089 27,252 Photonics 58,931 53,184 Environmental Monitoring 12,568 11,205 99,588 91,641 Total Group 406,190 335,278 Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net present value.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2016: Discount rates: Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 123 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 123 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 11 Goodwill continued CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to March 2016 and relate to revenue forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins in each of the operating companies.
The relative value ascribed to each assumption will vary between CGUs as the budgets are built up from the underlying operating companies within each CGU.
A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2016 budget to derive the cash flows arising in the year to March 2017 and a longterm rate is applied to these values for the year to March 2018 and onwards, as described below.
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, using the Groups economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 9.72% 2014: 10.65%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific operating assumptions for each CGU.
This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 10.10% to 12.91% 2014: 10.52% to 13.70% across all CGUs.
CGUs to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant.
The assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGUs are: Risk adjusted discount rate Short-term growth rates Long-term growth rates Significant CGU 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 11.49% 11.24% 7.20% 2.79% Doors, Security and Elevators 10.58% 13.70% 7.20% 5.09% 2.15% 2.14% Health Optics 12.91% 12.88% 7.20% 1.49% 2.35% 2.35% Photonics 11.68% 11.61% 3.26% 2.07% 2.17% 2.16% Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring was not a significant CGU in the prior year.
Short-term growth rates are based on sectoral organic growth rates achieved in the current year, but are capped at the Groups overall current year organic growth rate to ensure that future uncertainties are adequately reflected.
Long-term growth rates are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the Group sells into.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The remaining amortisation periods for these assets are six years, seven years and nine years respectively.
2 Technical know-how assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, estimated to be between three and ten years.
Within this balance the only individually material item relates to RCS which has a carrying value of 10,466,000 2014: nil and nine years remaining to amortise.
3 Trademarks, brands and patents which include protected intellectual property are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between eight and ten years.
There are no individually material items within this balance.
4 Internally generated capitalised development costs are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be three years.
There are no individually material items within this balance, which comprises capitalised costs arising from the development phase of the R&D projects undertaken by the Group.
5 Other intangibles comprise licence and product registration costs amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and five years.
6 The net transfer from property, plant and equipment and computer software to internally generated capitalised development costs relates to project specific assets.

Until its disposal, PSRM was treated as an associate, and not a subsidiary, because the party holding the remaining 50% was considered to exert more control.
On the 14 July 2014, the Group also disposed of 12,517 shares in Optomed Oy Optomed, representing 10.72% of its shareholding in the associate.
The Groups residual interest in Optomed is 33.07%.
As one of the largest shareholders, the Group continues to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the company and so continues to apply the equity method of accounting for its interest.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

Contingent purchase consideration The provision at the beginning of the year comprised 1,389,000 falling due within one year and 6,173,000 falling due after one year.
In the current financial year, the additional provision related mainly to a change in estimate in relation to the acquisition in the prior year of Microsurgical Technologies Limited MST from $6,504,000 to $9,061,000.
6,054,000 was provided on the acquisition of Advanced Electronics Limited Advanced see note 24, of which 2,800,000 was settled during the year.
A payment of 1,000,000 was also made in respect of ASL Holdings Limited ASL, a prior year acquisition.
These payments represent substantially all of the current year utilisation of 4,002,000.
The 2,311,000 release of provision related mainly to a revision to the estimate for the second earn out payment for the acquisition of ASL from 2,500,000 to 197,000.
Of the closing total provision of 9,650,000, 9,484,000 is due within one year mainly for the acquisitions of Advanced and MST, 3,356,000 and 6,123,000 respectively.
The balance, relating mainly to ASL, is due after one year.
The MST balance was settled on 22 May 2015.
Dilapidations and empty property provisions Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them.
The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2015 to 2029, though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period.
The provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.

The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

A further reduction in the UK tax rate to 20%, effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted in the UK Finance Act 2013.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK.
However, 19,422,000 2014: 21,532,000 of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3,399,000 2014: 3,143,000 of which only 757,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
At 28 March 2015 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 479,000 2014: 479,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Changes during the year in the issued ordinary share capital were as follows: Issued and fully paid 000 At 29 March 2014 37,902 Share options exercised 63 At 28 March 2015 37,965 The total consideration received in cash in respect of share options exercised amounted to 893,000 2014: 194,000.

Share incentive plan Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plans trustees at the time of the award and are held in trust until their transfer to qualifying employees: vesting is conditional upon completion of three years service.
The costs of providing this Plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting period.
Share option plans At the beginning of the year, the Group had outstanding issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under a share option plan, approved by shareholders in 1999.
This share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option, both of which were subject to performance criteria.
No further awards have been made under the Company share option plan since 3 August 2005.
All options lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
There are no remaining options over ordinary shares at 28 March 2015.
Options over 626,810 ordinary shares were exercised in the year.
No options over ordinary shares lapsed in the year.
The fair value of the options granted has been recognised in full, and accordingly there is no charge in the current or prior year.
Performance share plan The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans from which no further grants can be made.
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Groups relative Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE 250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital measure.
Awards which do not vest on the third anniversary of their award lapse.
A summary of the movements in share awards granted under the performance share plan is as follows: 2015 2014 Number of Number of shares shares awarded awarded Outstanding at beginning of year 3,587,492 3,802,315 Granted during the year 1,077,286 1,068,785 Vested during the year pro-rated for good leavers 983,228 1,198,568 Lapsed during the year 570,206 85,040 Outstanding at end of year 3,111,344 3,587,492 Exercisable at end of year The weighted average share price at the date of awards vesting during the year was 585.8p 2014: 557.7p.

24 Acquisitions In accounting for acquisitions, adjustments are made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their fair values to the Group.
Acquired inventories are valued at fair value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading are recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition are included and accounting policies are aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.

The remainder was satisfied by the issue of 657,000 of loan notes.
Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired shown above approximate to the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 revised.
None of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The three acquisitions in the year contributed 36,110,000 of revenue and 6,695,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 28 March 2015.
If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 6,843,000 and 1,146,000 higher respectively.
The combined fair value adjustments made for all acquisitions, excluding acquired intangible assets recognised and deferred tax thereon, resulted in net adjustments to goodwill of 3,831,000.

This was subsequently adjusted by an additional US$569,000 340,000 which was paid in July 2014 based on the final agreed value of the net tangible assets at the acquisition date.
RCS forms part of the Process Safety sector and specialises in the design, manufacture and sale of pipeline corrosion monitoring products and systems into diverse industries including oil, gas, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and utilities.
The acquisition of RCS expands Halmas portfolio of critical safety products which are sold into the Energy and Utility markets to protect life and operational assets.
The existing RCS management team remain in place and will continue to operate the business.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer related intangibles of 14,697,000: marketing and technology related intangibles of 10,869,000: with residual goodwill arising of 39,537,000.
The goodwill represents: a the technical expertise of the acquired workforce: b the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halmas businesses: and c the ability to exploit the Groups existing customer base.
The RCS acquisition contributed 22,038,000 of revenue and 3,705,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 28 March 2015.
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 5,525,000 and 771,000 higher respectively.

Contingent consideration is payable over a two year period based on the profits of the company for the twelve months to April 2014 and eleven months to March 2015.
The total estimated payable was 6,054,000, of which 2,601,000 has been paid in cash and 199,000 in loan notes in the year.
The remainder, subject to actual performance, is payable in June 2015.
The maximum contingent consideration payable is 10,100,000.
Managements current best estimate of the likely total payable has been increased by 102,000 to 6,156,000 based on performance observed to date.
Advanced forms part of the Infrastructure Safety sector and specialises in the manufacture of networked fire detection and control systems.
Advanceds controllers can be integrated into system solutions using field devices and products from a broad spectrum of suppliers, meeting the increasing diversity of regulatory requirements across the world.
Its main manufacturing facility is located near Newcastle in the UK with a dedicated electronics and software development facility in Barnsley.
It has additional commercial offices in the UK, the USA and Dubai.
Advanced brings to Halma complementary products that help capture the international growth opportunity in the increasingly regulated Fire market.
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer related intangibles of 5,306,000: marketing and technology related intangibles of 1,462,000: with residual goodwill arising of 9,824,000.
Included in the 5,458,000 fair value adjustment to intangible assets shown above is a reduction of 1,310,000 to the carrying value of capitalised development costs resulting from the application of Halma accounting policies to the acquisition date balance.
The residual goodwill represents: a the technical expertise of the acquired workforce: b the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halmas businesses: and c the ability to exploit the Groups existing customer base.
The Advanced acquisition contributed 13,936,000 of revenue and 2,301,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 28 March 2015.
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 1,318,000 and 323,000 higher respectively.

Initial consideration paid for the company was CHF8,403,000 5,678,000 including the consideration of CHF903,000 610,000 received for the Groups disposal of its 50% ownership interest in its associate PSRM Immobilien AG PSRM and CHF2,687,000 1,815,000 paid for the industrial segment of Plasticspritzerei.
The Group then immediately sold the industrial segment of the business to a third party, resulting in a net cash cost to the Group of CHF4,813,000 3,253,000, CHF5,716,000 3,863,000 excluding the proceeds from the PSRM disposal.
These transactions have resulted in the Group owning only those assets which support Medicels business.
Plasticspritzerei will be operated by Medicels management within Halmas Medical sector, further expanding the Groups manufacturing excellence in ophthalmic diagnostic and surgical instrumentation.
No customer relationship intangibles were recognised as part of this transaction because Medicel is the sole customer for the Plasticspritzerei business acquired and the fair value of any customer relationship is therefore eliminated from a Group perspective.
Goodwill of 3,665,000 was recognised as part of this transaction, representing the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the assets acquired and is attributable to: a the technical expertise of the acquired workforce: b the opportunity to secure and advance the supply chain of Medicel AG: and c the ability to exploit the Groups existing customer base.
The Plasticspritzerei acquisition resulted in intercompany sales to Medicel of 2,176,000 and external sales of 136,000 for the period ended 28 March 2015 and contributed 689,000 to profit after tax for the Group for the same period.
If this acquisition had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated that the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been nil and 52,000 higher respectively.

The 9,151,000 net cash acquired comprised 9,619,000 cash and 468,000 of bank loans, and net overdraft disposed related to the Monitor overdraft of 36,000.
The net of the above 4,000,000 cash outflow, 9,619,000 net cash acquired and 36,000 net overdraft disposed is equal to the increase in cash and cash equivalents of 5,655,000 in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.

No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographic locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition of income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting Policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer-term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 186,936,000 2014: 160,848,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Liquidity risk The Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility of 360m with its core group of five banks extending to November 2018.
This facility is the main source of long-term funding for the Group.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 141 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 141 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 26 Financial instruments continued The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 561,000 2014: 505,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a 214,000 2014: 207,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 28 March 2015.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 998,000 at 28 March 2015 2014: 1,742,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 92,000 2014: 92,000, and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of 906,000 2014: 1,650,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 40,232,000 2014: 32,789,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, loan notes and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 142,124,000 at 28 March 2015 2014: 109,027,000.
All bank loans bear interest at floating rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
The loan notes outstanding at 28 March 2015 attract interest at 1%.
The Groups weighted average interest cost on net debt for the year is 1.80% 2014: 1.59%.
2015 2014 000 000 Analysis of interest bearing financial liabilities Sterling denominated bank loans 132,000 97,000 Swiss Franc denominated bank loans 7,762 7,891 Total bank loans 139,762 104,891 Overdrafts principally Sterling and US Dollar denominated 1,705 1,405 Sterling denominated loan notes 657 2,731 Total interest bearing financial liabilities 142,124 109,027 For the year ended 28 March 2015 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Groups profit before tax by 1,675,000 2014: 1,520,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the contingent purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The contractual contingent purchase consideration due after one year of 166,000 2014: 6,173,000 falls due between one and two years.
No amounts are payable after more than two years 2014: nil.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,694,000 2014: 1,569,000 due between one and two years, 1,197,000 2014: 1,308,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of nil 2014: 2,000 due after more than five years.
Deferred government grant income due after more than one year includes 124,000 2014: 28,000 due between one and two years, 146,000 2014: 47,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 595,000 2014: 610,000 due after more than five years.
The Groups bank loans are revolving credit facilities and the amount and timing of future payments and drawdowns is unknown.
It is therefore not possible to calculate the interest arising on these loans and we have therefore not disclosed the maturity of the gross cash flows including interest in relation to these liabilities.

The Group has additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facilities of 16,892,000, which mature in June 2015 and were undrawn at 28 March 2015.
Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 28 March 2015 and 29 March 2014 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value of floating and fixed rate borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature within one year and therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months: Average exchange rate Foreign currency Contract value Fair value 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 000 000 Forward contracts not in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.51 1.65 4,780 5,186 3,163 3,139 67 15 Euros 1.34 1.21 1,881 1,951 1,407 1,613 34 Other currencies 4,721 515 87 25 9,291 5,267 54 10 Forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge US Dollars 1.59 1.60 7,313 7,993 4,593 4,982 320 173 Euros 1.29 1.18 12,289 10,334 9,563 8,724 527 174 Czech Koruna 35.73 32.82 73,251 109,844 2,050 3,347 93 27 Other currencies 3,282 1,028 265 19 15,388 11,387 379 339 Total forward contracts US Dollars 1.56 1.62 12,093 13,179 7,756 8,121 387 188 Euros 1.29 1.19 14,170 12,285 10,970 10,337 561 174 Czech Koruna 35.73 32.82 73,251 109,844 2,050 3,347 93 27 Other currencies 8,003 1,543 352 6 24,679 16,654 433 329 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 180 147 Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure 253 182 433 329 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 143 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 143 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 26 Financial instruments continued The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a 1,069,000 2014: 496,000 asset and 636,000 2014: 167,000 liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Any movements in the fair values of the contracts are recognised in equity until the hedge transaction occurs, when gains losses are recycled to finance income or finance expense.

With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, Mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
The carrying amount of the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 US Dollar 169,047 142,678 42,793 32,433 Euro 61,741 64,525 15,488 14,818 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 Profit 5,153 4,633 1,964 1,899 Other equity 11,478 10,022 4,205 4,519 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar and Euro because more of the Groups profits are earned in these currencies.

Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2015 and August 2029 and the latter between April 2015 and March 2020.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2015 2014 2015 2014 000 000 000 000 Within one year 8,611 6,566 429 453 Within two to five years 19,495 13,989 503 856 After five years 6,151 2,257 34,257 22,812 932 1,309 28 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan both UK have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002 03.
During the prior year, following consultation with members, it was decided that future benefit accruals for existing members of these sections would cease from 1 December 2014.
From that date, the former defined benefit members joined the existing defined contribution section within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
This closure to future benefit accruals resulted in a curtailment gain in the prior year of 4,246,000 before closure costs of 298,000, which was included in the Adjustments column in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution plans, with the exception of three small defined benefit plans in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG, Robutec GmbH and Plasticspritzerei AG, which was acquired during the year.
Defined contribution plans The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution plans was 5,616,000 2014: 4,042,000 and represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group may be reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit plans The Groups significant defined benefit plans are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The plans are funded plans.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2011 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2012 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
The actuarial valuations as at 1 December 2014 and 1 April 2015 for the two plans are currently being conducted.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 145 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 145 Notes to the Accounts continued Notes to the Accounts continued 28 Retirement benefits continued An alternative to the projected unit credit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the plan liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the plan.
The Group estimates that this would amount to 430m 2014: 390m.

Under the current arrangements, cash contributions in the region of 7m per year would be made for the immediate future with the objective of eliminating the pension deficit.
However, the schedule of future contributions is currently under discussion.

In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension plan.
The results of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the plan.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the plans investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of plan assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of its defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.

The Group estimates the plan liabilities on average to fall due over 20 and 27 years, respectively, for the Halma and Apollo plans.
29 Disposal of operations On 30 May 2014, the Group disposed of Monitor Elevator Products, Inc. Monitor from its Infrastructure Safety sector.
The total consideration was US$6,243,000 3,716,000, of which US$5,514,000 3,282,000 was received in cash at completion, before subsequently being reduced by US$171,000 102,000 for the final agreed closing net asset value.
The remaining US$900,000 was retained in escrow to be released to Halma on the second anniversary of the transaction subject to any valid warranty indemnity claims being made by the purchaser.
The Directors estimate that the entire US$900,000 held in escrow will be received.
The profit on disposal was US$1,808,000 1,076,000, which is net of 189,000 of cumulative foreign exchange losses reclassified to the Income Statement and 273,000 of disposal costs.
No goodwill was disposed of or impaired as a result of this transaction.
The Groups partial disposal of Optomed during the year for 876,000 695,000 resulted in a profit on disposal of 223,000.
Further details are included in Note 14.
The Groups disposal of its 50% ownership interest in PSRM Immobilien AG PSRM for CHF903,000 610,000 resulted in a fair value gain being recognised in the Income Statement of 131,000.
This represented the excess of the fair value of the Groups interest in the associate over its carrying value.
The 4,248,000 cash inflow on disposal of operations shown in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement represents the 3,180,000, 695,000 and 610,000 proceeds from the sale of the shares in Monitor, Optomed, and PSRM respectively plus the 36,000 overdraft in Monitor less the disposal costs of 273,000.
The total profit on disposal of operations shown in note 1 of 1,430,000 comprises 1,076,000 for the disposal of Monitor, 223,000 for the partial disposal of shares in Optomed and 131,000 for the fair value gain recognised in relation to the disposal of PSRM.
In the prior year, the loss on disposal relates to late transaction costs and a revision to amounts recoverable on the disposals by the Group, in 2012, of its Asset Monitoring businesses and Volumatic Limited.
The 1,917,000 cash inflow related mainly to a release from escrow.
Further details are provided on page 143 of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts.
30 Events after the balance sheet date On 19 May 2015 the Group acquired the entire membership interest of Value Added Solutions, LLC VAS for an initial cash consideration of $5,000,000, adjustable based on the closing date working capital.
Additionally, a performance payment of up to $1,500,000, based upon results achieved in the period to 1 October 2016, will be paid on 1 April 2017.
VAS will operate as a bolt-on to Diba Industries Inc. within Halmas Medical sector.
Diba Industries creates innovative fluid handling solutions that are invaluable to device OEMs, while VAS specialises in precision plastic machining, production of thermally bonded manifolds, and fluid component integrations.
VAS will add complementary expertise, capabilities, and products that will allow Diba to provide broader solutions to its existing customers, as well as expand its customer base.
VASs production facility is located in Berlin, CT USA.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, it is impractical to provide further information.
