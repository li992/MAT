They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced disclosure framework and the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Interserve Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on page 41.
The Company meets the definition of qualifying entity under FRS 100 Application of financial reporting requirements.
Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2015, the Company has changed its accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS 101.
In doing so, the Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 1.6 - 33 and related appendices, but has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 101 September 2015 not to present a third statement of financial position.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced disclosure framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The prior year financial statements were restated for material adjustments on adoption of FRS 101 in the current year.
For more information see note Q.
The Companys financial statements are included in the Interserve Plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions in preparing these financial statements, as permitted by FRS 101 Reduced disclosure framework: the requirements of paragraphs 45 b and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 Share-based payment: the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures: the requirements of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement: the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements to present comparative information in respect of: - paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: - paragraph 73 e of IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment: and - paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible assets: the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: the requirements of paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of cash flows: the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors: the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 Related party disclosures: the requirements in IAS 24 Related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group: the requirements of paragraphs 134 d to 134 f and 135 c to 135 e of IAS 36 Impairments of assets.
These financial statements are separate financial statements.
The Company is exempt from the preparation of consolidated financial statements because it is included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements of the Group.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Annual Report and Financial Statements of the Group as shown in notes 1 to 33.
Adoption of new and revised standards As explained above, the Company has adopted FRS 101 for the first time in the current year.
As part of this adoption, the following Standards and Interpretations have been applied in the current year.
The impact of the application of these specific Standards and Interpretations on the financial statements is shown in note Q.
Going concern The directors have made enquiries and have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.

Leases are negotiated for an average term of 10 years and rentals are fixed for an average of five years with a break option to extend at five years.
Leases of land and buildings are typically subject to rent reviews at five-yearly intervals and provide for the lessee to pay all insurance, maintenance and repair costs.
Foreign currency The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates its functional currency.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, calculated to write off the cost or valuation over its expected useful life, at rates ranging between: Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold property Over period of lease Computer hardware and software 33.3% Furniture, office and plant equipment 10% to 33.3% Useful lives are reviewed at the end of every reporting period.
The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in respect of guarantees given to the Companys subsidiaries, associated undertakings, joint ventures and pension scheme.
Due to the nature of the guarantees it would be difficult to reliably measure the Companys potential obligation and the Company considers it unlikely that there will be requirement to make a financial settlement as a result of these guarantees.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less any impairment at the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Company participates in, and is the sponsoring employer of, both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff.
For the defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised directly in equity and recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss because is excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that is it no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Finance costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Differences between borrowing costs payable in the year and costs actually paid are shown in accruals in the balance sheet.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
Debtors Debtors are initially measured at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the profit and loss where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly-liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
bank and other borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans, intercompany loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Creditors Creditors are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is taken out and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as, and effective as, hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in the profit and loss.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled through the profit and loss in the same period in which the underlying hedged item is recognised in the profit and loss.
However, when the transaction that is being hedged results in a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of that asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Until then, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss for the period.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the profit and loss as they arise.
These derivative instruments are designated as fair value through the profit and loss.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Movements in hedging reserve in equity are detailed in the changes in equity statement.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity-based and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees of the Group headed by the Company.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value for grants pre-2006 was measured by the use of the Black-Scholes model and subsequently a stochastic model was used.
Note 29 to the Group consolidated financial statements sets out details of the share-based payments.
Share-based payments to employees of subsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant employer and the recharged income is credited to the profit and loss account of the Company.
For cash-settled share-based payment a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance sheet date.
For equity-settled share-based payment the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Company accounting policies, which are described above, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period which the estimate is revised if the revisions affect only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
There are no critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates which are dealt with separately below, that the directors have made in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries Determining whether the Companys investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments value in use.
The value in use calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments.
The carrying amount of the investments in subsidiaries at the balance sheet was 462.9 million 2014: 463.9 million with 1.0 million 2014: nil of impairment losses recognised in 2015.
Retirement benefit obligations In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the Company has disclosed in note L the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit obligations.
In the calculation a number of assumptions around future salary increases, increase in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation and discount rates have been made.
Small changes in these assumptions can lead to significant changes to the overall scheme liabilities, as disclosed in note L. Judgement is also exercised in establishing the fair value of retirement benefit assets, most notably the valuation of the buy-in contract to insure some of the benefits of a subset of the pension membership of the Scheme provided by the insurer.
B Profit on ordinary activities after taxation Interserve Plc reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 of 14.9 million 2014: 30.3 million.
The auditors remuneration for audit services to the Company was 0.2 million 2014: 0.2 million.
C Employees The average number of persons employed, being full-time equivalents, by the Company during the year, including directors, was 239 2014: 153.

The pension scheme valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP LCP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2015.
As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in other comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The Company contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the Interserve Pension Scheme, where benefits are generally related to service and final salary.
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for new hires, with membership of the defined benefit arrangements only permitted when specific contract terms require defined benefit provision.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangements are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to profit and loss.
The current funding target for the Companys defined benefit scheme is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits based on projected salaries where relevant.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and the Company to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Company that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Company to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.

In practice any movement in assumptions is likely to be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net liability asset is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts above.

This additional exposure is 120.9 million of equity performance as at 31 December 2015 2014: 109.4 million.
The collateral for these futures is held in gilts and cash: the gilt values shown are after the deduction of the collateral amount backing the futures.
Around 65% of the Companys direct equity investments are in relation to UK equities 2014: 70%.
Holdings in Government bonds are predominantly index-linked.
Alternative investments include diversified growth funds, fund of hedge funds and emerging market multiasset funds primarily unquoted.
During 2014 the Trustee of the Interserve Pension Scheme secured an insurance policy which protects the Company from certain risks associated with approximately 35% of the Schemes defined benefit obligation.
The policy aims to closely match the pension payments to the Schemes pensioner members who are above age 65 in July 2014.
The policy is not an exact match for the benefits in certain areas, notably: pension increases if price inflation falls below 0%: differences between the increase in the Consumer Prices Index and the Retail Prices Index: and the eligibility criteria for dependants pensions.
The element of the policy that does not provide an exact match for the benefits covers 280.3 million of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2015.
The policy covers a further 8.8 million of the defined benefit obligation which precisely matches the benefits in respect of certain dependants in receipt of pension.
Except for the element of the policy which precisely matches the benefits around 3% of the total policy value, the policy has been valued as the estimated replacement cost at the accounting date by the Companys actuarial advisers, LCP, in accordance with the fair-value requirements of IFRS 13.
The small matching element has been valued at the same amount as the defined benefit obligation in respect of the matched benefits.
The infrastructure holding predominantly consists of the remaining portfolio of PFI investments originally transferred by the Company to the Interserve Pension Scheme in November 2009 and January 2013.
This holding reduced over the year due to the sale of part of the portfolio for 31.5 million.
The schemes have not directly invested in any of the Companys other financial instruments nor in other assets or properties used by the Company.

This includes deficit contributions to the Interserve Pension Scheme of 13.3 million.
The timing and outflow of these provisions will depend on when claims are settled.
The Company aims to close out old insurance years on a regular basis if favourable pricing can be obtained from the market in order to avoid holding on to unnecessary provisions.

The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognised a pension liability of 8.0 million in the Companys FRS 101 balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 and a deferred tax asset of 1.6 million.
The net balance is recognised in other comprehensive income.
2 FRS 101 requires that all provisions, whether short or long term, are disclosed separately on the balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP provisions were disclosed as creditors falling due within one year and after more than one year.
At 1 January 2014 0.1 million of onerous lease and 13.1 million of insurance provisions were included in creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
This has been redisclosed as a non-current asset.
