TSRs are generated for BT Group plc and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT Group plc share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
