OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTS & OTHER INFORMATION AGGREKO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 127 17 Trade and other receivables continued The Group assesses credit quality as explained below: Power Solutions Industrial This is a high transaction intensive business and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business and there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in this business.
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible as a percentage of total gross debtors was 1% 2014: 2%.
Power Solutions Utility This business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Customers are mainly state owned utilities in emerging markets.
In many instances the contracts are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk prole and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bonds and guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
Contracts are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the customer and country risk.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the Power Solutions Utility business although the risk of a major default is high.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2015 for our Power Solutions Utility business was 223 million 2014: 208 million.
Within this balance, receivable balances totalling 59 million 2014: 83 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
This payment cover guards against the risk of customer default rather than the risk associated with customer disputes.
The risk associated with the remaining 164 million 2014: 125 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable in a cost effective manner.
