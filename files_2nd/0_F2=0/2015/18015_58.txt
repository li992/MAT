Details of the schemes are as follows: Deferred Annual Bonus Plan This scheme is applicable to Executive Directors and Divisional Executive Directors.
The award made in February 2015 in respect of 2014, is only applicable to Executive Directors.
Under this scheme, awards are made annually consisting of only Deferred Shares, which are linked to the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme details of which are contained in the Directors remuneration report on pages 88 to 104.
The value of Deferred Shares is determined by the payout under the Annual Bonus Scheme: half of the annual bonus is paid in cash and the remainder is compulsorily deferred into Deferred Shares.
Directors have the option to defer up to 100% of their annual bonus into Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares are held for a period of 3 years from the date of award, during which they are not forfeitable, except in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
For awards made in 2014 and earlier, participants were awarded conditional matching awards at the same time as the award of Deferred Shares, where participants received 2 Matching Shares for every Deferred Share.
Following the award made in February 2014, it is not planned to award any further matching awards.
The vesting conditions for matching awards made in 2014 were such that 33% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS is equal to growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 4% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 12% per annum.
