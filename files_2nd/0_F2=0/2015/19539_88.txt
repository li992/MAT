The difference between the statutory effective tax rate and the underlying tax rate relates to an impairment which is not deductible for tax purposes.
The underlying effective tax rate is higher than the UKs statutory rate of tax due to the geographic profile of the Group.
In addition, there is an obligation to account for local business taxes in the corporate tax charge.
These additional tax charges are offset by research and development tax credits which are a government incentive in a number of operating territories.
The 2014 tax reconciliation has been restated to show the relationship between the groups statutory profit before income tax and income tax expense, rather than the relationship between underlying profit before tax and underlying tax charge, as presented in the 2014 financial statements.
5 Earnings per share This note shows how earnings per share EPS is calculated.
EPS is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each ordinary share.
Basic EPS is calculated on profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS shows what the impact would be if all outstanding, exercisable share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at the year-end.
This note also provides a reconciliation between the statutory profit figure, which ties to the consolidated income statement on page 104, and the Groups internal measure of performance, underlying profit.
See note 3.6 for details of the adjustments made between statutory and underlying profit, and note 4 for the tax impact on these adjustments.
Accounting policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held as treasury shares, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, exercisable at the end of the year.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
They are share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
