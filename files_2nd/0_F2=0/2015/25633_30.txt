Segment information Management has determined its operating segments based on the analysis used to make strategic decisions.
Business segment analysis The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments: Risk & Insurance, Employee Benefits and Head Office & Other operations.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Risk & Insurance segment comprises JLTs global specialist, wholesale, reinsurance broking, personal lines and SME activities.
The Employee Benefits segment consists of pension administration, outsourcing and employee benefits consultancy, healthcare and wealth management activities.
Certain Risk & Insurance and Employee Benefits operating segments have been disclosed within the reporting segments given their individual size.
The Head Office & Other segment consists mainly of holding companies, central administration functions, the Groups captive insurance companies and the Groups investments in associates.
The JLT Asia Employee Benefits segments is now disclosed as reportable segments to meet the quantitative threshold required by IFRS 8.
Lloyd & Partners was merged into JLT Specialty at the beginning of the year.
The businesses located in the United States, the Nordic region and the Netherlands previously reported under JLT Specialty have been reclassified respectively to JLT USA and JLT EMEA both included in Other Risk & Insurance.
The Healthcare business previously reported under JLT Specialty has been reclassified to JLT Re.
Segment results Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based upon a measure of underlying trading profit.
Segment results include the net income or expense derived from the trading activities of the segment together with the investment income earned on fiduciary funds.
Interest income on the Groups own funds and finance costs are excluded since the trading activities of the Groups primary segments are not of a financial nature.
Income tax expense and the charge in respect of non-controlling interests are excluded from the segmental allocation.
Segment assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments and are therefore all reported within Head Office & Other.
Investments in associates The Group owns the following stakes in its principal associates: 20% of GrECo, which operates mainly in Austria and Eastern Europe: 25% of MAGJLT, which operates mainly in Italy and 25% of March-JLT, which operates mainly in Spain.

Equivalent average cash and investment balances during the year amounted to 766 million 2014: 719 million denominated principally in US dollars 55%, Sterling 17% and Australian dollars 11%.
Based upon average invested balances each 1% movement in the average achieved rate of return would impact anticipated interest income by some 7.7 million.

Where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge or match these interest rate exposures.
The Groups policy is to continue to manage net interest rate exposures arising from the Groups cash including fiduciary funds and borrowings.
Each 1% movement in the average achieved interest rate impacts interest expense by approximately 5.5 million based on average net borrowings in 2015.

Employee information continued Key management personnel are defined as persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly, including any director of the Group.
This represents the Group Board of Directors and the Group Executive Committee only.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments comprise the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013, Senior Executive Share Scheme, Executive Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Schemes.
JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 The Group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility PDMRs.
The scheme was renewed in 2013.
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced options and are satisfied using market-purchased shares.
The awards vest in full or in part depending on satisfaction of the performance conditions which are set out on pages 72 and 74 of the Directors Remuneration Report.
The awards have a 3 year performance period and have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Senior Executive Share Scheme The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees.
The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the Group.
Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
The awards have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme Options were granted at a fixed price usually market price and are exercisable after the vesting period usually 3 years.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or market-purchased shares.
Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise.
This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29th September 2006.
Sharesave Scheme The Sharesave Scheme is open to all employees and are exercised after 5 years from the date of grant.
The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the market price on the date preceding the date of invitation.
All Sharesave Schemes options have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee remains in employment with the Group.
All options must be exercised within 6 months of the vesting date.
Fair value of awards Under IFRS 2 the fair value of awards granted during the year, calculated using a Black-Scholes model, is set out below: Black-Scholes model assumptions Exercise Share price on Dividend Risk free Fair value of price Performance grant date Volatility yield Maturity interest rate one award pence period pence % % years % pence JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2013 Senior Executive Share Scheme 2015 25 March - 2015 - 18 1,052.00 18.34 - 1 - 3 0.60 1,052.00 2015 1 April - 2015 - 18 1,032.00 18.35 - 3 0.62 1,032.00 2015 10 September - 2015 - 18 1,030.00 18.62 - 1 - 3 0.67 1,030.00 2015 21 September - 2015 - 18 1,022.00 18.58 - 1 - 3 0.72 1,022.00 The option holders who have awards under the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Assuming that the dividend yield is zero and that the options are issued with no cost to the employees, then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using a 3 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Groups employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
For Executive Share Option and Sharesave Schemes this is 20%.
For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee.

The UK Government introduced a 1% reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax from April 2015.
This reduction reduced the UK tax rate from 21% to 20%.
In July 2015, the UK Government announced further measures in relation to the UK corporation tax rate, reducing the headline rate of corporation tax to 19% from April 2017 and then to 18% from April 2020.
As at 31st December 2015 these further rate reductions have been enacted.
The impact of these further rate reductions has therefore been incorporated into the income tax expense for the year ended 31st December 2015, taking into consideration when timing differences are expected to reverse.

A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period and are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital.
2 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations were: The budgeted trading profit growth: management determines budgeted trading profit based on past experience and its expectation for market development.
The budgeted IBA interest income growth:- this is based on past experience and long-term interest rates projections.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segment and country of operation.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with long-term economic forecasts in the countries of operation.
The value-in-use is compared to an adjusted goodwill.
The adjusted goodwill is the goodwill grossed up to reflect a 100% ownership by the Group.
The key sensitivity analysis are: A decrease of 1% on the growth rate resulted in a reduction of 19% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.
An increase of 2% on the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 38% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.

Instruments included in level 1 are financial instruments traded in active markets for which the fair value is based upon quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
Instruments included in level 2 are financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives and for which the fair value is determined by using internal and external models.
These models maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 2 includes derivatives used for hedging.
The valuations of which are performed using a discounted cash flow methodology incorporating observable market forward foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2.
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
Instruments included in level 3 are financial instruments for which one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data.
In respect of deferred and contingent consideration and Redemption liabilities option contracts, unobservable inputs include managements assessment of the expected future performance of relevant acquired businesses and are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology.
A 1% movement in the discount rate applied in the calculation of the redemption liability in respect of JLT Specialty Insurance Services Inc. the largest item within the redemption liability, would result in a change of the overall redemption liability of 9%.
A reconciliation of the movements in level 3 is provided below: Assets Liabilities Level 3 Level 3 000 000 At 1st January 2015 4,088 19,383 Exchange differences 216 150 Additions 1,964 - Companies acquired - 24,539 Utilised in the year - 4,264 Charged to income statement 143 880 At 31st December 2015 6,125 40,388 Of the 143,000 charged to the income statement, 131,000 is included in net finance costs and 12,000 in other operating costs.

b In line with IAS 19 Revised the expected return on scheme assets assumption is the same as the discount rate assumed for the liabilities.
c Mortality assumptions for the UK scheme are based on 105% of the S2PxA tables, with improvements based on CMI 2015 tables with a 1.25% p. a. long-term rate of improvement.
Mortality assumptions for the US Scheme and US Stable Value Plan are based on the RP2014 Mortality Table with MP2015 Projections.
Mortality assumptions for the Canadian Scheme are based on the CPM-2014 Private Table with generational projection using scale CPM-B1D2014.
Mortality assumptions for the Irish Scheme, assume that deaths after retirement will be in accordance with standard mortality tables 90% PxA92C 2004 with allowance for expected future mortality improvements.
There is assumed to be no pre-retirement mortality.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Change to assumptions obligation Discount rate decrease of 0.1% increase of 2.0% Inflation rate increase of 0.1% increase of 1.0% Life expectancy increase of 1 year increase of 4.0% The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
Note this sensitivity is for defined benefit obligations only and does not consider the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the assets, in particular the assets held in respect of the insured pensioners.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous year.

Significant management judgement is required to comply with this guidance.
The Group analyses its litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.

Pending the outcome of the UK Financial Conduct Authoritys review a provision has been created for the estimated administration costs of completing the work for this review.
It is too early to determine if there is any other liability.
Subsequent events At the date of this report, the Group is planning to restructure its UK Employee Benefits business with a flatter structure that is better able to respond to the current dynamic marketplace.
The Group estimates, that the cost of this will be in the region of 12 million.
