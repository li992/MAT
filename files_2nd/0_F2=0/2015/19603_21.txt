com 177 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Non-GAAP financial information These Financial Statements include financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
These measures, which include trading profit, trading profit margin, EPSA and underlying growth, exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash items that Group management believes are not related to the underlying performance of the Group.
These non-IFRS financial measures are also used by management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparisons of performance to historical results on both a business segment and a consolidated Group basis.
Non-IFRS financial measures are presented in these Financial Statements as the Groups management believe that they provide investors with a means of evaluating performance of the business segment and the consolidated Group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which the Groups management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group may not be excluded when preparing financial measures under IFRS.
These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Revenue Underlying growth in revenue is used to compare the revenue in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis.
This is achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired in material business combinations and for movements in exchange rates.
Underlying growth in revenue is not presented in the accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS and is therefore a measure not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a non-GAAP measure.
The Group believes that the tabular presentation and reconciliation of reported revenue growth to underlying revenue growth assists investors intheir assessment of the Groups performance in each business segment and for the Group as a whole.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence of local management.
The Groups management uses this non-GAAP measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business segment and a consolidated Group basis.
Revenue growth at constant currency is important in measuring business performance compared to competitors and compared to the growth ofthe market itself.
The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local managements efforts with respect to the business in the year of acquisition.
Depending on the timing of the acquisition, there will usually be a further step change in the following year.
A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from acquisitions.
The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate centre in line with strategic objectives.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure isthat it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately have a significant impact on total revenues.
The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation.
In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated.
The Groups management considers that the non-GAAP measure of underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of growth in revenue are complementary measures, neither of which management uses exclusively.
Underlying growth in revenue reconciles to growth in revenue reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the constant currency exchange effect and the acquisitions and disposals effect, described below.
The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales and is measured as the difference between: 1 the increase decrease in the current year revenue translated into US Dollars at the current year average exchange rate and the prior revenue translated at the prior year rate: and 2 the increase decrease being measured by translating current and prior year revenues into US Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The acquisitions and disposals effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired material business combinations and recent material business disposals.
This is calculated by comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue which include acquisitions and exclude disposals from the relevant date of completion with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, adjusted to include the results of acquisitions and exclude disposals for the commensurate period in the prior year.
These sales are separately tracked in the Groups internal reporting systems and are readily identifiable.
Reported revenue growth, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to underlying growth in revenue as follows: 2015 2014 2013 % % % Reported revenue growth 0 6 5 Constant currency exchange effect 8 1 1 Acquisitions Disposals effect 4 5 2 Underlying revenue 4 2 4 SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.
com 178 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Trading profit, trading profit margin and trading cash flow Trading profit, trading profit margin and trading cash flow are trend measures, which present the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability and cash flows.
The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively: acquisition and disposal related items arising in connection with business combinations, including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets, impairments and integration costs: restructuring events: gains and losses resulting from legal disputes: and significant uninsured losses.
In addition to these items, gains or losses that materially impact the Groups profitability or cash flows on a short-term or one-off basis, are excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, respectively.
Underlying growth in trading profit and trading profit margin trading profit expressed as a percentage of revenue and trading cash flow are measures, which present the growth trend in the long-term profitability of the Group.
Underlying growth in trading profit is used to compare the period-on-period growth in trading profit on a like-for-like basis.
This is achieved by adjusting for the impact of material business combinations and disposals and for movements in exchange rates in the same manner as underlying revenue growth is determined, as described above.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share EPSA EPSA is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the post-tax impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability.
The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends.
Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure and is determined by adjusting attributable profit for the items that are excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit and items that are recognised below operating profit that affect the Groups short-term profitability.
The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is earnings per ordinary share EPS.

Transactional and translational exchange The Groups principal markets outside the US are, in order of significance, Continental Europe, UK, Australia and Japan.
Revenues in these markets fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on consolidation.
During the year, the average rates of exchange against the US Dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro weakened from 1.33 to 1.09 18%, Sterling weakened from 1.65 to 1.48 10%, the Swiss Franc weakened from 1.09 to 1.00 8%, the Australian Dollar weakened from 0.90 to 0.73 18% and the Japanese Yen weakened from 105.84 to 120.38 14%.
The Groups principal manufacturing locations are in the US, Switzerland, UK and China.
The majority of the Groups selling and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase finished products from these locations.
As a result of currency movements compared with the previous year, sales from the US became relatively more profitable to allof these countries.
The Groups policy of purchasing forward a proportion of its currency requirements and the existence of an inventory pipeline reduce the short-term impact of currency movements.

Provisions that do not relate to contractual obligations are not included in the above table.
The agreed contributions for 2016 in respect of the Groups defined benefits plans are: $36m for the UK including $29m of supplementary payments, $20m for the US Plan and $6m for other funded defined benefit plans.
The table above does not include amounts payable in respect of 2016 and beyond as these are subject to future agreement and amounts cannot be reasonably estimated.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change in control of the Company or the Group following a takeover, such as bank loan agreements and Company share plans.
None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole.
In addition, there are service contracts between the Company and its Executive Directors which provide for the automatic payment of a bonus following loss of office or employment occurring because of a successful takeover bid.
Further details are set out on page 100.
The Company does not have contracts or other arrangements which individually are essential to the business.
2014 Financial highlights Revenue Group revenue increased by $266m 6% on a reported basis, from $4,351m in 2013 to $4,617m in 2014.
The underlying increase is 2%, after adjusting for the 5% impact of the acquisitions of ArthroCare and a Brazilian distributor and 1% attributable to the unfavourable impact of currency movements.
Despite flat growth in the Established Markets, growth of 17% in the Emerging & International Markets contributed to this underlying increase of 2%.
Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold increased by $62m 6% on a reported basis from $1,100m in 2013 to $1,162m in 2014.
The underlying movement is 5% after adjusting for the net impact of 4% from the ArthroCare acquisition and 3% attributable to the unfavourable impact of currency movements.
The movement in underlying costs of goods sold of 5% is largely attributable to the increase in underlying trading.
During 2014, $12m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses 2013 $12m and $23m of acquisition related costs 2013 $5m were charged to cost of goods sold.
Selling, general and administration expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $261m 12% on a reported basis from $2,210m in 2013 to $2,471m in 2014.
The underlying movement is 5% after adjusting for the net impact of 7% from the ArthroCare acquisition.
Currency movements had no impact.
The underlying increase of 5% is due to the promotion of new product and costs associated with the RENASYS distribution hold and HP802 termination and the underlying increase in trading.
In 2014, administrative expenses included $62m of amortisation of other intangible assets 2013 $64m, $49m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses 2013 $46m, an amount of $129m relating toamortisation of acquisition intangibles 2013 $88m and $95m ofacquisition related costs 2013 $26m.
com 182 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Research and development expenses Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue remained broadly consistent at 5.1% in 2014 2013 5.3%.
Actual expenditure was $235m in 2014 compared to $231m in 2013.
The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate it from competitors.
Operating profit Operating profit decreased by $61m to $749m from $810m in 2013.
This comprised an increase of $6m in Advanced Surgical Devices and a decrease of $67m in Advanced Wound Management.
The movement in Advanced Surgical Devices is attributable to the continuing pressure on margins and its investment in the Emerging & International Markets.
Advanced Wound Management has been adversely impacted by the costs associated with the RENASYS distribution hold and the impairment and costs associated with the termination of the HP802 programme.
Net interest receivable payable Net interest receivable increased by $26m from net $4m receivable in 2013 to a net receivable of $22m in 2014.
This movement is primarily due to an increase in interest payable as a result of financing the ArthroCare acquisition.
Interest receivable also decreased following the repayment by Bioventus LLC of their loan note in October 2014.
Other finance cost Other finance costs in 2014 remained at $11m and principally relate tocosts associated with the Groups retirement benefit schemes.
Taxation The taxation charge decreased by $33m to $213m from $246m in 2013.
The reported rate of tax was 29.9%, compared with 30.5% in 2013.
After adjusting for specific transactions that management considers affect the Groups short-term profitability, restructuring and rationalisation expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles, acquisition related costs and legal and other items, the tax rate on trading profit was 27.7% 2013 29.2%.
Commentary on the Group balance sheet Non-current assets Non-current assets increased by $1,303m to $4,866m in 2014 from $3,563m in 2013.
This is principally attributable to the following: Property, plant and equipment increased by $75m from $816m in 2013 to $891m in 2014.
Depreciation of $222m was charged during 2014, assets with a net book value of $15m were disposed of and $14m was impaired relating to HP802.
These movements were offset by $298m of additions relating primarily to instruments and other plant & machinery and $62m of additions arising on acquisitions of ArthroCare.
The balance relates to unfavourable currency movements totalling $34m.
Of this movement, $829m arose on the acquisition of ArthroCare and $15m on the acquisition in Brazil.

Intangible assets decreased by $693m from $1,054m in 2013 to $1,747m in 2014.
Intangible assets totalling $817m and $16m arose on the acquisition of ArthroCare and Brazil respectively.
Amortisation of $191m was charged during the year and assets with a net book value of $1m were disposed of.

The movement relates to the following: Inventories rose by $175m to $1,181m in 2014 from $1,006m in 2013.
This movement is principally attributable to the acquisitions of ArthroCare and distributor in Brazil which increased inventory by $70m and $36m relating to the purchase of an advanced quantity of an ingredient to ensure continued supply of REGRANEX.
The level of trade and other receivables increased by $53m to $1,166m in 2014 from $1,113m in 2013.
The movement primarily relates to the increase in underlying revenues and $54m from the ArthroCare acquisition offset by $75m of unfavourable currency movements.
