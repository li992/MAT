Group consolidation and operating segments continued 4b.
Segment reporting The Group has four reportable segments, as described below.
These segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly reported to the Groups Board of Directors, which is considered to be the Groups chief operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
UK Car Insurance The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and other products that supplement the car insurance policy.
It also includes the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting car insurance in the UK.
The Directors consider the results of these activities to be reportable asone segment as the activities carried out in generating the revenue are not independent of each other and are performed as one business.
This mirrors theapproach taken in management reporting.
International Car Insurance The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting car insurance outside of the UK.
It specifically covers the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, Lolivier assurance auto in France and Elephant Auto inthe US.
None of these operations are reportable on an individual basis, based on the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Price Comparison The segment relates to the Groups price comparison websites: Confused.
com in the UK, Rastreator in Spain, LeLynx in France and compare.
Each of the Price Comparison businesses are operating in individual geographical segments but are grouped into one reporting segment as Rastreator, LeLynx and compare.
com do not individually meet the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Other The Other segment is designed to be comprised of all other operating segments that do not meet the threshold requirements for individual reporting.
Itincludes UK household insurance, the Groups commercial van insurance broker, Gladiator, and commercial van insurance.
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation to the Consolidated Income Statement andConsolidated Statement of Financial Position.
An analysis of the Groups revenue and results for the year ended 31 December 2015, by reportable segment, is shown below.
The accounting policies ofthereportable segments are consistent with those presented in the notes to the financial statements for the Group.

Segment revenues The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external policyholders.
Revenue within these segments isnot derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% or more of the Groups total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is 14.2 million which has been eliminated on consolidation.
In 2014 the total of price comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments was 9.5 million and was not eliminated on the grounds ofmateriality.
In2015, the intra-group trading amount has grown to 14.2 million.
The Directors have therefore decided to amend the accounting policy suchthat this has been eliminated for the year ended 31 December 2015, and this policy will be adopted for future periods.
There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Revenues from external customers for products and services are consistent with the split of reportable segment revenues as shown on page 81.
Information about geographical locations All material revenues from external customers, and net assets attributed to a foreign country, are shown within the International Car Insurance reportable segment shown on the previous pages.

These assets and liabilities are not regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in the reportable segment format.
There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Car Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment profits.
This is consistent with regular reporting to the Board of Directors.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in insurance and other receivables.
The segment assets and liabilities at 31 December 2014 are as follows: As at 31 December 2014 UK Car International Car Price Insurance Insurance Comparison Other Eliminations Total m m m m m m Property and equipment 29.0 2.5 0.7 0.1 32.3 Intangible assets 89.6 12.2 2.9 2.5 107.2 Reinsurance assets 677.5 137.9 14.4 829.8 Insurance and other receivables 532.2 21.7 11.7 3.7 134.0 435.3 Financial investments 1,892.3 98.6 0.1 1,990.8 Cash and cash equivalents 101.8 38.6 49.0 16.4 205.8 Reportable segment assets 3,322.4 311.5 64.3 37.0 134.0 3,601.2 Insurance contract liabilities 1,839.4 228.7 29.3 2,097.4 Trade and other payables 900.7 42.4 7.4 15.3 965.8 Reportable segment liabilities 2,740.1 271.1 7.4 44.6 3,063.2 Reportable segment net assets 582.3 40.4 56.9 7.6 134.0 538.0 Unallocated assets and liabilities 42.9 Consolidated net assets 580.9 ADMIRAL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 83 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 5.
Premium, claims and profit commissions 5a.
Accounting policies i Revenue premiums Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue, net of insurance premium tax, proportionally over the period of cover.
Premiums with an inception date after the endofthe period are held in the statement of financial position as deferred revenue.
Outstanding collections from policyholders are recognised within policyholder receivables.
ii Revenue profit commission Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which motor premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be earned on a particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios.
The commission is dependent on the ultimate outcome of any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and expense ratios used in the preparation of the financial statements move below a contractual threshold.
iii Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets Premiums The proportion of premium receivable on in-force policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets as the unearned premium provision gross and reinsurers share respectively.
Claims Claims and claims handling expenses are charged as incurred, based on the estimated direct and indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising on events occurring up to the balance sheet date.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not.
Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the income statement for the period in which the adjustments aremade and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums net of deferred acquisition costs to meet future claims and related expenses.
Co-insurance The Group has entered into certain co-insurance contracts under which insurance risks are shared on a proportional basis, with the co-insurer taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion of each claim.
As the contractual liability is several and not joint, neither the premiums nor claims relating to the co-insurance are included in the income statement.
Under the terms of these agreements the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the costs of acquiring and administering the business.
Reinsurance assets Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on the insurance contracts issued by the Group are classified as reinsurance contracts.
A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant insurance risk transfer between the insured and the insurer.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated inaconsistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be written down to its recoverable amount.
On the commutation of reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer is discharged from all obligations relating to the contract.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities relating to the commuted contracts are settled in the period in which the commutation agreement is signed.

Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities i Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk The Group is involved in issuing motor insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its underwriting partners.
Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
Reserving risk is the risk that the value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, whether reported or unreported.
Other risks include inadequate pricing and reinsurance policies, and inappropriate claims management processes and controls.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 6, it has delegated the detailed oversight of risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Group also has a Reserving Committee which comprises senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions.
The Reserving Committee primarily recommends the approach for UK Car Insurance reserving but also reviews the systems and controls in place to support accurate reserving and material reserving issues such as Periodic Payment Order PPO and claims inflation, which represent the key uncertainties in the amount ortiming of claims settlements.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group.
These include pricing policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and coand reinsurance arrangements as detailed below.
Reserving policies and controls Reserving risk is mitigated through a series of processes and controls.
The key processes are as follows: Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of management information and exception reporting of significant movements.
Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the uncertainty isincreased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation for the cost of future care of the claimant.
Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques, including reviews of the potential ranges around best estimates.
Use of a reserving policy which informs managements reserving decisions for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
As described in note 3, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the policy determines that reserves should be set within a range above projected best estimate outcomes toallow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
Co-insurance and reinsurance As noted in the Strategic Report, the Group shares a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated with external underwriters.
In 2015, 40% ofthe UK risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the primary risk is borne by the co-insurer.
A further 35% of the UK risk was ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts.
Co-insurance and reinsurance contracts are also used in the International Car Insurance businesses.
Further detail can be found in the Strategic Report on page 28.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Concentration of insurance risk The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group has historically written only one significant line of UK insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base.
The introduction of the international car insurance businesses in recent years and the launch of UK household business in 2012 will further contribute to the diversification of the Groups insurance risk as these businesses grow.

The increase in net claims reserve from 1,057.8 million at 31 December 2014 to 1,180.2 million at 31 December 2015 is partly as a result of the increase in the size of gross claims reserves but largely due to the impact of commutations of reinsurance contracts in the UK Car Insurance business.

Accounting policies i Investment income and finance costs Investment income from financial assets comprises distributions as well as net realised and unrealised gains on financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, interest income and net realised gains from assets classified as available for sale, and interest income on holdings in term deposits and gilts.
Finance costs from financial liabilities comprise interest expense on subordinated notes, calculated on the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability or group of financial assets or financial liabilities and allocates the interest income or expense over the expected life of the asset or liability.
ii Financial assets investments and receivables Initial recognition Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, Available for Sale AFS assets, loans and receivables or held tomaturity investments.
At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and classified according to the purpose for which they were acquired.
The Groups investments in money market liquidity funds are designated as FVTPL at inception.
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds are managed as a group of assets andinternal performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis.
The Groups holdings in Fixed Income and Asset Backed Securities are classified as available for sale AFS investments, which is consistent with the intention for which they were purchased.
The Groups deposits with credit institutions and gilts are classified as held to maturity investments, which is consistent with the intention for which they were purchased.
Transaction costs associated with the purchase of all financial assets are expensed within the income statement as incurred.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant realised or unrealised gain or loss recognised through the income statement.
AFS fixed income and asset backed securities are stated at fair value.
Unrealised changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income OCI.
Interest income on debt securities is recognised within profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Deposits and gilts with fixed maturities, classified as held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement, as are any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method.
Impairment losses are recognised through theincome statement.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held at fair value or amortised cost are impaired.
Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset, may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset.
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty.
Identified impairments of financial assets are recognised in the income statement, except in the case of assets classified as available for sale where unrealised gains have been recognised through OCI.
In this instance, impairments of the asset are first set against the unrealised gain in OCI with any excess being recognised in the income statement.
fide-recognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset and all the attaching substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term deposits with original maturities of three months orless.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.
iii Financial liabilities Initial recognition The Groups financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes and other financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Subsequent measurement Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement.
fide-recognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under that liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
iv Fair value measurement of assets held at amortised cost The fair value of gilts and subordinated notes held at amortised cost is calculated with reference to quoted market valuations.
See note 6d for a comparison of fair value and carrying value at the statement of financial position date.
The Groups deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the capital is not expected.
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The Group has the option to defer interest payments on the notes but to date has not exercised this right.
The aggregate fair value of subordinated dated notes at the balance sheet date is disclosed in the table on page 91.
The Group holds a revolving credit facility of 100 million which expires in July 2018.
As at 31 December 2015, 20 million was drawn under this agreement and is included as other borrowings in the table above.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Fair value measurement The measurement of investments at the end of the period, for investments held at fair value and short term debt securities held at fair value, is based onactive quoted market values level one.
The measurement of available for sale debt securities at the end of the period is also based on active quoted market values level one.
The deposits are held with well rated institutions: as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the capital isnotexpected.
There is no quoted market for these holdings and as such a level two valuation is used.
The book value of term deposits is 267.6 million 2014: 263.1 million.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities The Groups activities expose it primarily to financial risks of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in full in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
Credit risk The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables.
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite and, during 2015 and historically, no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds and the parameters set for managing the Fixed Income Mandates.
Both forms of investment hold a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions.
The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the Investment Committee.
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions, the Group only conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength ratings.
In addition, many reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group withholds the cash received as collateral.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous highand low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2015 is 3,323.3 million 2014: 3,047.4 million, being the carrying value of financial investments and cash, and the excess of reinsurance assets over amounts owed to reinsurers under funds withheld arrangements.
The Group does not use credit derivatives orsimilar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2015 and 2014 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2015 or 2014.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 Rating m m Financial institutions Credit institutions AAA 247.8 291.1 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 679.4 625.8 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 1,230.3 1,216.0 Financial institutions Credit institutions BBB and below 234.0 119.6 UK Government gilts AA 198.2 199.1 Reinsurers AA 266.8 207.8 Reinsurers A 9.2 16.3 Interest rate risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
As noted above, the Group invests the following asset types: Money market liquidity funds and cash plus liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
Term deposits with well rated institutions are short in duration one to five years.
These are classified as term and valued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the carrying value of the asset, nor the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
Available for sale debt securities.
These securities are held within two segregated mandates.
The guidelines of the investments retain a similar credit quality of the money market funds all holdings are investment grade.
The duration of the securities is relatively short and similar to the duration of the on book claims liabilities the average duration is three years.
Therefore neither the capital value of the gilts, nor the interest return, will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group also holds a financial liability in the form of 200 million of subordinated notes with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon of 5.5%.
This liability is valued at amortised cost and therefore neither the carrying value of the deposits, nor the interest payable, will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.

Financial assets and liabilities continued Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, orcan only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments is immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups other financial liabilities, trade payables and other payables is shown in note 10.
The subordinated notes have a ten year maturity whereas all trade and other payables will mature within three to six months of the balance sheet date.
Referto the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Ofthe total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 764.7 million 2014: 756.5 million, 554.3 million 2014: 585.7 million is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 5.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cash flows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore, considered tobesignificant.
Foreign exchange risks Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas.
Although the relative size of the international operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held inthe currency of the liabilities: however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Groups exposures to net assets held in euros and dollars at the balance sheet date were 9.0 million and 87.3 million respectively 2014: 2.2 million and 72.0 million.
Fair value For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
For assets held at fair value through profit and loss, their value equates to level one quoted prices in active markets of the fair value hierarchy.
For gilts and subordinated notes, the fair value is calculated with reference to the quoted market valuation.
This is compared to carrying value earlier in this note.

Accounting policy i Contribution from additional products and fees and Other Revenue Contribution from additional products and fees and Other Revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of products supplementing the core motor insurance policy, administration and other charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies paid by instalments and vehicle commission charges paid by coand reinsurers.
Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Groups obligations to provide services.
Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is recognised immediately.
An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and broking commission earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying insurance policy.

Accounting policies i Acquisition costs and operating expenses Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over the period in which those premiums are earned.
All other operating expenses are charged to the income statement in the period that they are incurred.
ii Employee benefits Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees.
The contributions payable to these schemes are charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the equity settled schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liability.
For equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares granted as determined at the grant date excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market conditions such as profitability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
For cash settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the closing Admiral Group share price at the end ofthe period.
Prior to the vesting of each scheme, the closing share price at the end of the reporting period is used as an approximation for the closing share price at the end of the vesting period.
As with equity settled schemes, non-market vesting conditions also impact on the total charge expensed over the vesting period.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change in the assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 8f for further details on share schemes.

i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualified for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The current maximum award for each year is 3,600 per employee 2014: 3,000 per employee.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and, hence, no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the Directors Remuneration Report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2015 scheme is 3,017,900 2014 scheme: 2,684,798.
The amount of 2014 award that actually vests is based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the three year period the award applies to.
For the 2014 scheme, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject to these performance conditions.
The range of awards is as follows: If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest.
EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests.
To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
For awards in 2015 and onwards there are now three performance conditions which the 50% not guaranteed to vest are subject to.
These are three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 excluding investment companies, and ROE, weighted equally.
Performance range Performance measure Threshold Maximum EPS growth vs. LIBOR Growth in line with LIBOR Growth of 10% p. a. in excess of LIBOR TSR vs. FTSE 350 excluding investment companies Median Upper Quartile ROE 25% 55% Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the Directors Remuneration Report.

Accounting policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
It is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The principal temporary differences arise from carried forward losses, depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges.
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge.
Any excess is recognised directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
The probability of the availability of future taxable profits is determined by a combination of the classification of the status of the businesses holding cumulative tax losses and the business plan profit projections for that business, subject to appropriate stress testing.

This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2015 has been calculated based on the rate at which each timing difference is most likely to reverse.

Deferred income tax asset continued Analysis of deferred tax asset continued The deferred tax asset relating to carried forward losses of 9.9 million 2014: 13.4 million relates to losses incurred in the Groups US price comparison business compare.
com, and is calculated at the local US rate of tax 35%.
Elephant Auto asset recognised: nil: unprovided asset: 20.7 million the asset is not expected to be recovered over the next seven years.
Whilst profits areexpected to be available after 2022, the Group considers these longer term forecasts to be more uncertain and has therefore not recognised an asset thatwould only be supported by profits beyond the seven year period.
com asset recognised: 9.9 million: unprovided asset: 10.6 million the asset is expected to be fully recovered over the next five years.
The recognised asset has been limited to the amount supported by forecast cash flows over the next five years.
The forecasts and underlying assumptions have been reviewed and approved by the Board.
In addition, the forecasts have been stressed for both revenue and profit reductions and the asset remains recoverable under the stressed scenarios.
The Group considers full recovery of this asset to be probable.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had unused tax losses amounting to 89.6 million 2014: 33.3 million relating to these businesses, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Other assets and other liabilities 10a.
Accounting policy i Property and equipment, and depreciation All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives.
These useful economic lives are as follows: Improvements to short leasehold buildings four to ten years Computer equipment two to four years Office equipment four years Furniture and fittings four years Motor vehicles four years ii Impairment of property and equipment In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If any such indications exist, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value.
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the assets value in use.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
iii Leased assets The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classed as finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner as equivalent owned assets.
Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors and the finance costs are spread over the periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.

Accounting policy continued iv Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, and represents thedifference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 First time adoption.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs according to business segment andis reviewed annually for impairment.
The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2015 is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment.
Impairment of goodwill The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount by allocating the goodwill to CGUs and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections in the value in use calculations is 5.9% 2014: 6.8%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which is in line with the market source: Bloomberg.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses incurred during the period.
Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes in the market.
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that correspond to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date.
This balance is held as an intangible asset.
It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned.
Software Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life generally the licence term.
Internally generated software isrecognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs incurred in the development stage capitalised.
The internally generated software assets are amortised over the expected useful life of the systems and amortisation commences when the software is available for use.
The carrying value of software is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any impairment exists.
Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.
iv Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of an event that occurred before the balance sheet date, when a cash-outflow relating to this obligation is probable and when the amount can be estimated reliably.
Where an obligation exists, but the likelihood of a cash out flow or the amount is uncertain, or where there is a possible obligation arising from a past event that is contingent on a future event, a contingent liability is disclosed.
Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.
Where it is probable that a cash inflow will arise from a contingent asset, this is disclosed.

As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
Allannual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised.

Excess capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up to the Group holding company inthe form of dividends on a regular basis.
The Groups dividend policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held a for regulatory purposes: b to fund expansion activities: and c as a further buffer against unforeseen events.
This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the Groups capital.
The Groups regulatory capital requirements are discussed in the Group Financial Review within the Strategic Report.

At the same point, the Group began charging its panel of coand reinsurers a vehicle commission.
The substance of these changes meant that the total premiums written increased by the amount of revenue that was previously earned from the sale of non-optional legal protection policies.
The vehicle commission included within Other Revenue is therefore eliminated from the turnover measure to avoid double counting.
Other reconciling items represent co-insurer and reinsurer shares of Other Revenue in the Groups International Car Insurance businesses.
