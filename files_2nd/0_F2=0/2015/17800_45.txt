As at 31 December 2014, the Group held a 17.2% stake in Duluth Metals Limited Duluth, accounted for as an available-for-sale investment.
As at 31 December 2014, Duluth held a 60% interest in Twin Metals Minnesota Limited Twin Metals, with the Group holding the remaining 40% interest in Twin Metals.
As disclosed in Note 19, in November 2014 Antofagasta entered into a binding letter of agreement to acquire 100% of Duluth.
The acquisition completed subsequent to the 2014 year end following approval from Duluths shareholders in January 2015.
Movements in the fair value of the available-for-sale investment in Duluth had previously been recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The agreed acquisition terms indicated a final fixed value for the Duluth shares, and that there had therefore been an impairment in the value of the Duluth shares to this amount.
Accordingly, an impairment charge of $26.3 million was recognised in 2014 in respect of this available-for-sale investment, with fair value losses previously recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income being transferred to the income statement and recognised within this impairment loss.
This impairment change was largely offset by the related $28.6 million disposal gain recognised in 2014 in respect of the temporary loss of control of the Twin Metals project as set out in Note 17.
The fair value through profit or loss line represents the fair value gains relating to liquid investments.
