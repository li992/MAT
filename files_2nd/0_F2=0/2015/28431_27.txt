In setting the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee considers a range of factors including: Conditions elsewhere in the Group Across the Group, remuneration is reviewed regularly with the intention that all employees are paid appropriately in the context of their local market and given their individual skills, experience and performance.
Each business units salary increase budget is set with reference to local market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee considers salary increase budgets in each business unit when determining the salaries of Executive Directors.
Prudential does not consult with employees when setting the Directors remuneration policy.
Prudential is a global organisation with employees, and agents in multiple business units and geographies.
As such, there are practical challenges associated with consulting with employees directly on this matter.
As many employees are also shareholders, they are able to participate in binding votes on the Directors remuneration policy and annual votes on the annual report on remuneration.
Shareholder views The Remuneration Committee and the Company undertake regular consultation with key institutional investors on the remuneration policy and its implementation.
This engagement is led by the Remuneration Committee Chairman and is an integral part of the Companys investor relations programme.
The Committee is grateful to shareholders for their feedback and takes this into account when determining executive remuneration.

Additionally, a number of resolutions in writing were approved by the Committee between these meetings relating to new and promoted Executive Directors remuneration arrangements and separation arrangements for those Executive Directors who stepped down from the Board.
The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee also had the benefit of advice from: Group Chief Risk Officer: Chief Financial Officer: Group Human Resources Director: and Director of Group Reward and Employee Relations.
Individuals are never present when their own remuneration is discussed and the Committee is always careful to manage potential conflicts of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management about executive remuneration proposals.
During 2015, Deloitte LLP was the independent adviser to the Committee.
Deloitte was appointed by the Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
As part of this process, the Committee considered the services that Deloitte provided to Prudential and its competitors as well as other potential conflicts of interests.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operate under their code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.
Deloitte regularly meet with the Chairman of the Committee without management present.
The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Prudential that may impair their independence and objectivity.
The total fees paid to Deloitte for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2015 were 77,700 charged on a time and materials basis.
During 2015, Deloitte also gave Prudential management advice on remuneration, as well as providing guidance on Solvency II, taxation, internal audit, real estate and other financial, risk and regulatory matters.
Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within Deloitte.
In addition, management received external advice and data from a number of other providers.
This included market data and legal counsel.
This advice, and these services, are not considered to be material.
During the year, the Company has complied with the appropriate provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding directors remuneration.

When the Committee took these decisions it considered: The salary increases awarded to other employees: The performance and experience of each executive: The relative size of each directors role: and The performance of the Group.
Salary increases for the wider workforce vary across our business units, reflecting local market conditions: in 2015 salary budgets increased between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent for the wider workforce.
To provide context for this review, information was also drawn from the following market reference points: Executive Role Benchmark s used to assess remuneration Pierre-Olivier Boue Group Chief Risk Officer FTSE 40 Jackie Hunt Chief Executive, UK & Europe FTSE 40 International Insurance Companies Michael McLintock Chief Executive, M&G McLagan UK Investment Management Survey International Insurance Companies Nic Nicandrou Chief Financial Officer FTSE 40 International Insurance Companies Barry Stowe Chief Executive, PCA Towers Watson Asian Insurance Survey Tidjane Thiam Group Chief Executive FTSE 40 International Insurance Companies Mike Wells President & CEO, JNL Towers Watson US Financial Services Survey LOMA US Insurance Survey As reported in last years report, after careful consideration the Committee decided to increase salaries by 3 per cent for all Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asia, whose salary was increased by 5 per cent to reflect the inflationary environment in Asia.
The Committee also approved changes to 2015 incentive opportunities for two Executive Directors: the Chief Executive, Prudential Corporation Asias maximum AIP and LTIP awards were increased to 180 per cent and 250 per cent of salary, respectively.
This reflects the importance of Prudential Corporation Asias strategic initiatives which are crucial to the achievement of Group-wide objectives.
The Chief Executive, Prudential UK & Europes maximum AIP and LTIP awards were increased to 175 per cent and 250 per cent of salary, respectively.
This reflects the fact that the scope of the incumbents role had increased due to the Groups expansion into Africa.
Additionally, this reflects the ambition of the UK & Europe business as it relates to the Groups growth and cash ambitions.

2015 AIP performance measures and achievement Financial performance The financial performance measures set for 2015 are shown below.
Prior to the start of the year, the Committee set stretching performance ranges for each of these measures in line with the Groups business plan targets.
The Committee reviewed performance against these ranges at its meeting in February 2016: in all of our bonus performance metrics, other than the new measure of ECap surplus, the Groups 2015 results exceeded its stretch plan targets.
The Committee also considered a report from the Group Chief Risk Officer which confirmed that these results were achieved within the Groups and business units risk appetite and framework.
The Group Chief Risk Officer also considered the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls, and specific actions taken to mitigate risks, particularly where these may be at the expense of profits or sales.
The Group Chief Risk Officers recommendations were taken into account by the Committee when determining AIP outcomes for Executive Directors.
The performance measures, their weightings and the achievement compared to the performance range, is illustrated below.

In deciding the portion of the awards to be released, the Committee considered actual financial results against these performance targets.
The Committee also reviewed underlying Company performance to ensure vesting levels were appropriate.
The Directors' remuneration policy contains further details of the design of Prudentials long-term incentive plans.
Prudential Long-Term Incentive Plan PLTIP and Group Performance Share Plan GPSP In 2013, all Executive Directors were made awards under the PLTIP or GPSP.
The awards were subject to challenging targets.
The weightings of these measures are detailed in the table below: Weighting of measures IFRS profit 1 2 Executive Group TSR Group or business unit Michael McLintock 100% Jackie Hunt 50% 50% business unit target Barry Stowe 50% 50% business unit target Mike Wells 50% 50% business unit target All other Executive Directors 50% 50% Group Notes 1 Group TSR is measured on a ranked basis over three years relative to peers.
2 IFRS profit is measured on a cumulative basis over three years.
Under the Group TSR measure, 25 per cent of the award vests for TSR at the median of the peer group increasing to full vesting for performance within the upper quartile.
The peer group for the awards is: Aegon Aflac AIA AIG Allianz Aviva AXA Generali Legal & General Manulife MetLife Munich Re Old Mutual Prudential Financial Standard Life Sun Life Financial Swiss Re Zurich Insurance Group Prudentials TSR performance during the performance period 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 was in the upper quartile of the peer group above ranked 5.
The portion of the awards related to TSR therefore vested in full.
Under the IFRS measure, 25 per cent of the award vests for meeting the threshold IFRS profit set at the start of the performance period increasing to full vesting for performance at or above the stretch level.
The table below illustrates the cumulative performance achieved over 2013 to 2015 compared to the Group targets set in 2013: Cumulative Cumulative target achievement Overall Group 2013-15 2013-15 vesting IFRS operating profit 8,329 million 10,147 million 100% The Committee determined that the cumulative IFRS operating profit target established for the PLTIP should be expressed using exchange rates consistent with our reported disclosures.
All the individual business units exceeded their stretch performance target and achieved 100 per cent vesting, other than Asia which exceeded plan performance, but not stretch performance, and therefore vested at 95 per cent.
The individual business unit IFRS targets have not been disclosed as the Committee considers that these are commercially sensitive and disclosure of targets at such a granular level would put the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.
The Committee will keep this disclosure policy under review based on whether, in its view, disclosure would compromise the Companys competitive position.
M&G Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan The phantom share price at vesting for the 2013 M&G Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan award is determined by the increase or decrease in M&Gs profitability over the three-year performance period with adjustments for the investment performance of its funds.

Recruitment arrangements In making decisions about the remuneration arrangements for those joining the Board, the Committee worked within the Directors remuneration policy approved by shareholders and was mindful of: The skills, knowledge and experience that each new Executive Director brought to the Board: The need to support the relocation of executives to enable them to assume their roles: and Its commitment to honour legacy arrangements.
Appointing high-calibre executives to the Board and to different roles on the Board is necessary to ensure the Company is well positioned to develop and implement its strategy and deliver long-term value.
As the Company operates in an international marketplace for talent, the best internal and external candidates are sometimes asked to move location to assume their new roles.
Where this happens, the Company will offer relocation support.
The support offered will depend on the circumstances of each move but may include shipping services, the provision of temporary accommodation and other housing benefits.
Executives may receive support with the preparation of tax returns, but no current Executive Director is tax equalised.
Barry Stowe and Mike Wells changed Board roles during the year.
As both these changes resulted in those Executive Directors relocating to enable them to assume their roles, relocation support in line with the approved Directors remuneration policy was provided.
Details of this support are included in the notes to the 2015 Single Figure table.
During the year, a relocation payment was made to Nic Nicandrou in line with a commitment made to him when he joined the Company in 2009 and disclosed in the 2009 annual report on remuneration.
Details of this payment are included in the notes to the 2015 Single Figure table.
Penny James and Tony Wilkey were promoted to the Board during the year.
Their outstanding share awards under deferred bonus plans and long-term incentives awarded before their appointment to the Board will continue to vest on the normal timescale and subject to the original conditions.
In addition, each of Barry Stowe, Mike Wells and Tony Wilkey received an additional LTIP award following the changes to their roles as detailed in the Long-term incentives awarded in 2015 table.
Payments to past directors and payments for loss of office During the year, the Committee considered the application of the Company's payments on loss-of-office policy.
The objective was to ensure that the application of the policy was aligned to individual circumstances and ensure there was no reward for failure.
The Committee's approach when exercising its discretion under the policy is to be mindful of the particular circumstance of the departure and the contribution the individual had made to the Group.
