Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Group holds cash balances, partly to meet payments as they fall due but also when appropriate to offset the long-term borrowings that it has in place.
The Group finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through debenture stock and secured bonds that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
