12 Share-based payments As at 4 July 2015, the Company operated one share award plan: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP There were 2,000 exercisable options under this scheme as at 4 July 2015 2014: nil.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP was approved by the Board in 2006 enabling the Group to award shares to particular individuals, normally in the form of nominal cost options.
The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee.
One grant was made in the period, to the Executive Directors and senior management.
These grants are exercisable in November 2016, dependent on the level of growth in Group EPS relative to RPI, as well as continuing employment.
The maximum life of options under the LTIP is ten years from the date of grant.
Full details of this plan are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 53.
On 30 June 2015, all non-exercisable share options were modified in order to protect option holders from the possible dilution to the value of their options following the return of capital to shareholders made in March 2015.
The Board requires that any adjustment made to options results in: the total market value of shares subject to option immediately prior to and immediately after the adjustment being substantially the same: and the exercise price payable under the option immediately prior to and immediately after the adjustment being substantially the same.
This was done by increasing the number of shares by 6.79% and decreasing the exercise price per share by 6.36%.
The fair value of options granted during the period was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
The significant inputs into the model are detailed below.
The volatility is measured at the standard deviation of share returns based on the daily share price over the twenty days prior to the grant date.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: October October November 2014 2013 2012 Share price at date of grant 861.0p 876.5p 641.5p Volatility 35.11% 40.00% 29.23% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 2.5% Option life 3years 3years 3years Risk-free interest rate 1.44% 1.35% 0.84% Discount factor, based on dividend yield to vesting date 0.670 0.670 0.779 Fair value of option 577.0p 587.4p 499.5p Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 4 July 2015 115 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements CONTINUED For the 53 weeks ended 4 July 2015 12 Share-based payments continued The fair value of the additional options granted in the modification and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: October October November 2014 2013 2012 Share price at date of grant 861.0p 876.5p 641.5p Volatility 32.78% 32.78% 32.78% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 2.5% Remaining option life 27 months 15 months 5 months Risk-free interest rate 1.40% 1.40% 1.40% Discount factor, based on dividend yeild to vesting date 0.690 0.718 0.831 Fair value of option 594.0p 629.5p 533.20p The number and weighted average exercise price of options under the LTIP at 4 July 2015 is as follows: Weighted Number of Weighted Number of average shares average shares exercise under exercise under price option price option 2015 2015 2014 2014 Outstanding at beginning of the period - 794,753 - 866,561 Granted during the period - 50,494 - 117,307 Adjusted during the period - 10,747 -- Exercised during the period - 249,168 - 163,962 Lapsed during the period - 437,768 - 25,153 Outstanding at end of the period - 169,058 - 794,753 The total income expense recognised in the income statement arising from share-based payments is as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 LTIP 894 1,036 Details of LTIP awards lapsing during the period, causing the current period credit, are included in the Remuneration report.
