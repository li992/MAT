NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Segmental analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODMs primary focus for review and resource allocation is the Group as a whole.
All revenue streams for the business are managed centrally by functional teams e. g. Demand, Supply, Procurement and Finance that have responsibility for the whole of the Groups product portfolio.
Although some discrete financial information is available to provide insight to the management team of the key performance drivers, the product group profit is not part of the CODMs review.
Management has judged that the Group comprises one operating segment under IFRS 8.
As such, disclosures required under IFRS 8 for the financial statements are shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Voluntary disclosure To assist the readers of the financial statements, management considers it appropriate to provide voluntary disclosure on a basis consistent with historical reporting of the product groups.
In disclosing the product group profit for the year, certain assumptions have been made when allocating resources which are now centralised at a group level.
Share of associates net profit forms a separate product group whose results are reviewed on a post-tax basis.
The Other product group comprises revenue earned from distributing product for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the other product groups.
Generally, central costs less external other revenue are recharged back into the product groups such that their result reects the total cost base of the Group.
Other operating profit therefore is nil.
The results under the historic segmentation basis for the year ended 31 March 2015 and for the year ended 31 March 2014 and the reconciliation of product group measures to the respective line items included in the financial information are as follows: Year ended 31 March 2015 2014 Note m m External revenue Cheese 274.4 264.6 Spreads 170.0 177.4 Dairies 881.6 944.8 Other 3.8 4.2 Total product group external revenue 1,329.8 1,391.0 Product group profit Cheese 33.1 39.3 Spreads 33.8 16.8 Dairies 1.8 18.8 Share of associate's net profit 14 0.3 Total product group profit 68.7 75.2 Finance costs 5 8.1 9.9 Adjusted profit before tax 60.6 65.3 Acquired intangible amortisation 2 0.4 0.4 Exceptional items 4 36.3 10.4 Other finance expense pensions 20 1.8 0.3 Group profit before tax 22.1 54.2 Total assets Cheese 292.4 266.2 Spreads 158.5 156.7 Dairies 229.8 268.5 Investments and share of associate 0.5 2.5 Other 42.7 37.4 Total product group 723.9 731.3 Unallocated assets 65.3 74.7 Total assets 789.2 806.0 profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles.

Group treasury has always been centrally managed andexternal interest income and expense are not allocated to product groups.
Further analysis of the Group interest expense is provided inNote5.
Tax costs are not included in the measure of product group profit.
Product group assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, receivables, assets in disposal group held for sale and investments in associates using the equity method and deferred consideration but exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets and deferred tax assets.
Other product group assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in the principal groups.
Inter-product group revenue comprises the sale of nished Cheese and Spreads products to the Dairies product group on a cost plus basis and is included in the product group result.
Other inter-product group transactions principally comprise the transfer of cream from the Dairies product group to the Spreads product group for the manufacture of butters.
Cream transferred into Spreads is charged by reference to external commodity markets and is adjusted regularly so as to reect the costs that the Spreads product group would incur if it was a stand alone entity.
Revenue from inter-product group cream sales is not reported as revenue within the Dairies product group but as a reduction to the Dairies product groups input costs.
Product group depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 0.4 million 2014: 0.4 million as these costs are not charged in the product group result.
Product group additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

As a result of this consolidation, the site at Crudgington, Shropshire ceased production in December 2014.
The exceptional costs incurred in the year were 16.7 million 2014: 3.8 million, including duplicate running, commissioning and redundancy costs.
The tax credit on this exceptional charge for the year was 3.2 million 2014: 0.8 million.
Rationalisation of operating sites In September 2014, the Group announced it was starting consultation with employees and their representatives regarding the closure of its glass bottling dairy in Hanworth, West London and its specialist cream potting facility in Chard, Somerset.
The Hanworth site is expected to remain operational until 2016.
An exceptional charge of 2.5 million has been incurred in the period, primarily comprising accelerated depreciation of assets following an assessment of their useful economic lives as well as other associated closure costs.
The Chard site is to be closed on economic grounds in the second half of 2015.
As a result a 7.8 million impairment charge has been recognised to write the assets down to nil being their net realisable value after selling costs which is lower than their value in use and a charge of 1.5 million in relation to redundancy and closure costs has also been recognised.
The tax credit on these exceptional costs in the year was 2.1 million.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2015 87 The numbers NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4 Exceptional items continued Business reorganisation In February 2013 the Group announced plans to reorganise the business into a single management and operational structure from 1April2013.
This reorganisation has resulted in exceptional redundancy costs in the year of 0.3 million.
In the year ended 31 March 2014 a 4.4 million exceptional charge was taken comprising redundancy costs and the write-down of an intangible asset.
The tax credit in the year on this exceptional charge was 0.1 million.

The tax effect of this exceptional charge was nil.
Deferred tax adjustment for change in UK corporation tax rate With effect from 1 April 2015, the corporation tax rate which was enacted on 2 July 2013 was reduced to 20%.
The deferred tax calculations based on the lower rate resulted in a deferred tax benefit of 1.9 million in the year ended 31 March 2014.
Due to the size and one-off nature of this significant amendment in the enacted rate, it was classied as an exceptional deferred tax credit in the year.

The effective tax rate continues to be below the headline rate of UK corporation tax due to the property profit income stream, on which the tax charges are sheltered by brought forward capital losses or roll-over relief.
The higher proportion of property profits this year has reduced the effective rate of tax but we expect the effective tax rate to increase next year.
UK corporation tax rate reduced to 21% from April 2014.
A further 1% reduction has been enacted, taking the rate to 20% from April 2015.
Owing to the availability of brought forward trading tax losses, the Group did not expect any taxable profits to arise before 1 April 2015, accordingly deferred tax was provided on all temporary differences in the prior year, as well as the current year, at 20%.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit from continuing operations by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the difference between the number of ordinary shares issued and the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued at the average market price of ordinary shares during the year.
Note that in the circumstances where there is a basic loss per share, share options are anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted losses per share.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the Directors opinion reects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share has been calculated.
The computation for basic and diluted earnings per share including adjusted earnings per share is as follows: Year ended 31 March 2015 Year ended 31 March 2014 Weighted Weighted average no Per share average no Per share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount m million pence m million pence Basic EPS from continuing operations 20.5 136.7 15.0 48.8 136.5 35.8 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 0.9 0.1 1.6 0.5 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 20.5 137.6 14.9 48.8 138.1 35.3 Adjusted EPS from continuing operations profit from continuing operations 20.5 136.7 15.0 48.8 136.5 35.8 Exceptional items net of tax 29.7 21.7 6.4 4.7 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets net of tax 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.2 Pension interest expense net of tax 1.4 1.1 0.2 0.1 Adjusted basic EPS from continuing operations 51.9 136.7 38.0 55.7 136.5 40.8 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 0.9 0.3 1.6 0.5 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations 51.9 137.6 37.7 55.7 138.1 40.3 Basic EPS from discontinued operations 136.7 1.4 136.5 1.0 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 0.9 1.6 Diluted EPS from discontinued operations 137.6 1.4 138.1 1.0 Basic EPS on profit for the year 20.5 136.7 15.0 50.2 136.5 36.8 Effect of dilutive securities: Share options 0.9 0.1 1.6 0.4 Diluted EPS on profit for the year 20.5 137.6 14.9 50.2 138.1 36.4 There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of signing of these financial statements.

With regard to the Dairies CGU, goodwill was fully impaired in 2011 12, however, given the low margins in this business and the challenging market conditions in 2014 15, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment within this CGU has been reviewed along with its value in use.
The impairment methodology and key inputs for all CGUs are as set out in Note 11.
For the Dairies CGU, consideration was taken of the future cash ows on an on-going basis and also the impact of the potential disposal of the Dairies operations to create a risk weighted value in use calculation of the CGU.
The discount rate applied to the value in use calculation was 7.8% 2014: 9.3%.
The key input assumptions in performing the impairment test were the profits expected from property sales, the allocation of corporate costs, the projected profit margin growth and the timing and cash consideration of any potential Dairies operations disposal.
The impairment review has not indicated any required write down of carrying value of property, plant and equipment in the year ended 31 March 2015.
The value in use calculations resulted in a low level of headroom compared to the carrying value and any movement in the input assumptions above could lead to an impairment.
During the year 9.2 million of assets were impaired.
The Chard site is to be closed on economic grounds in the second half of 2015, a 7.8 million impairment charge has been recognised to write the assets down to nil being their net realisable value after selling costs which is lower than their value in use.
In addition, 1.4 million of exceptional accelerated depreciation has been charged in relation to Hanworth see Note 4.
2013 14 In 2013 14, the Group impaired 1.8 million of property, plant and equipment relating to the strategic review of FoodTec UK Limited 0.3million, the closure of Proper Welsh Milk dairy 0.5 million and the consolidation to a single UK spreads production site 1.0 million.

At March 2012 goodwill in relation to the Dairies CGU was fully impaired and the carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2015 is nil.
All groups of CGUs with goodwill are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8.8% for Spreads 2014: 9.8% and 8.9% for MH Foods and Cheese 2014: 9.4%.
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specic risk factors.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the three-year period for MH Foods, Cheese and Spreads is nil 2014: 2% Cheese and MH Foods, nil Spreads.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2015 is: MH Foods 6.7 million 2014: 6.7 million Spreads 65.5 million 2014: 65.5 million Cheese 2.1 million 2014: 2.1 million Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, initiatives implemented and associated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year time frame.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU where appropriate and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
2014 15 and 2013 14 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those units to exceed their recoverable amount.

Dened benefit Pension Scheme The Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund the Fund is a final salary dened benefit pension scheme, which was closed to future service accrual from 1 April 2010 and had been closed to new joiners from 30 June 2006.
This pension scheme is a final salary scheme.
The Fund is administered by a corporate trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees directors are comprised of representatives of both the employer and employees, plus a professional trustee.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneciaries and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the benets.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a long term strategy for reducing investment risk as and where appropriate.
This includes an assetliability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets which perfrom in line with the liabilities of the plan so as to protect against ination being higher than expected.
In December 2008 and June 2009, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts.
During the financial year the Fund has introduced a Pension Increase Exchange PIE at retirement, an offer which enables members to exchange pension increases on their pensions accrued before April 1997, excluding Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP for a higher non-increasing pension.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2013 by the Funds independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
This valuation resulted in a deficit of 145.0 million compared to the IAS19 deficit of 56.3 million reported at that date.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out in 2016 17 on the 31 March 2016 position.
From October 2009, the Group has been making additional funding contributions to the scheme of 20.0 million per annum.
Under the latest schedule of contributions, which was signed in March 2014, the level of contributions will reduce to 13.0 million per annum for 2014 15 and 2015 16, increasing to 16.0 million per annum in 2016 17 and 20.0 million per annum for 2017 18 through to 2019 20.
These annual contributions include 2.8 million per annum of rental payments for land and buildings that are subject to a sale and leaseback agreement between the Group and the Fund as part of the schedule of contributions.
The Fund duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the Fund as a whole, the duration is around 18 years reecting the approximate split of the dened benefit obligation including insured pensioners between deferred members duration of 24 years, current non-insured pensioners duration of 15 years and insured pensioners duration of 11 years.
The principal risks associated with the Groups dened benefit pension arrangements are as follows: Asset Volatility The liabilities are calculated using the discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperfom this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Fund holds a significant proportion in a range of return-seeking assets which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to return-seeking assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Funds long terms objectives.
Changes in Bond Yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Funds liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the funds bond holdings.
Ination Risk A significant portion of the Funds benefit obligations are linked to ination, and higher expected future ination will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inationary increases are in place to protect against extreme ination.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with ination, meaning that an increase in expected future ination will also increase the deficit.
Longevity Risk The majority of the Funds obligations are to provide benets for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of GMP.
The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in higher benets for some members.
This would increase the dened benefit obligation of the Fund.
At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.

Includes obligations to deferred members of 551.6 million 2014: 498.6 million and non-insured members of 238.8 million 2014: 215.7 million.
The Group is entitled to any surplus on winding up of the Fund albeit refunds are subject to tax deductions of 35% at source.
Based on the present value of committed cash contributions at 31 March 2015 and the IAS 19 valuation at that date of 24.5 million, 16.9 million would be deducted from any notional surplus returned to the Group and this has been recognised as an additional liability in accordance with IFRIC 14.
However, it should be noted that cash contributions are determined by reference to the triennial actuarial valuation, not the IAS 19 valuation.
The actuarial deficit is greater than that recognised under IAS 19 since liabilities are discounted by reference to gilt yields rather than high quality corporate bond yields.

The Group does not use any of the pension fund assets.
i This is debt issued by emerging market countries denominated in the emerging markets domestic currency.
The debt is almost entirely issued by governments and not by corporations.
Investors benefit from higher yields on the bonds due to the additional risks of investing in emerging market countries, compared to developed countries and it is also expected that emerging market currencies will appreciate over time relative to developed countries.
ii Multi Asset Credit strategies invest globally in a wide range of credit-based asset classes which include bank loans, high yield bonds, securitised debt, emerging market debt and distressed debt of non-investment grade.
The investment strategies will also allocate amounts in investment grade credit, sovereign bonds and cash for defensive reasons.
The strategies are opportunistic and allocate dynamically to the best opportunities within the credit market from an asset allocation and individual security selection perspective.
iii Insurance linked securities are event-linked investments which allow investors outside the insurance industry to access insurance premiums for assuming various forms and degrees of insurance risk.
The underlying risk premium is a type of investment risk where the event is linked to natural or man-made catastrophes.
The premium paid to the investor represents compensation for the expected loss due to the uncertainty around the size and timing of the insured event.
iv Absolute Return Bond strategies are designed to deliver a positive return in all market environments and will take advantage of numerous alpha opportunities within the xed income universe.
The objective of the strategy is to capture returns from active management in a number of areas within xed income including interest rates, currencies, asset allocation and security selection.
The strategy will have long and short positions and employ a degree of leverage.
The strategies tend to have low sensitivity to the direction of interest rates and credit.
v Insight have been appointed to manage the Liability Driven Investment LDI portfolio for the Fund.
The objective is to hedge a proportion of the Funds liabilities against changes in interest rates and ination expectations by investing in assets that are similarly sensitive to changes in interest rates and ination expectations.
Insight will seek to add interest and ination exposure to the LDI portfolio over time in line with parameters that have been set by the Trustee.
Insight are permitted to use a range of swaps and gilt based derivative instruments as well as physical bonds to structure the liability hedge for the Fund.
In addition, Insight are responsible for monitoring market yields against a number of pre-set yield triggers and will increase the level of hedging as and when the triggers are met.
The principal assumptions used in determining retirement benefit obligations for the Fund are shown below: 2015 2014 2013 % % % Key assumptions: Price ination RPI 3.1 3.6 3.5 Price ination CPI 2.0 2.6 2.5 Pension increases Pre 1993 RPI to 7% annum 3.1 3.6 3.5 Pension increases 1993 to 2006 RPI to 5% annum 3.0 3.4 3.3 Pension increases Post 2006 RPI to 4% annum 2.8 3.1 3.0 Life expectancy at 65 for a male currently aged 50 years 23.9 23.8 22.6 Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old retired male years 22.4 22.3 21.7 Life expectancy at 65 for a female currently aged 50 years 26.8 26.7 25.3 Average expected remaining life of a 65 year old retired female years 24.6 24.5 24.1 Discount rate 3.4 4.3 4.6 The financial assumptions reect the nature and term of the Funds liabilities.
The mortality assumptions are based on analysis of the Fund members, and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates.
It has been assumed that members exchange 25% of their pension for a cash lump sum at retirement and 30% of deferred members take the PIE option at retirement.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, ination and mortality.
If different assumptions were used, this could have a material effect on the results disclosed.
The sensitivity of the results excluding unrecoverable notional surplus to these assumptions is as follows: Expected Expense for 15 16 Service Net Total P&L March 2015 Cost Interest Charge deficit m m m m Current Figures excluding unrecoverable notional surplus 0.8 0.6 1.4 24.5 Effect of a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate 0.5 0.5 16.0 Recalculated value 0.8 1.1 1.9 40.5 Effect of a 0.1% increase in the ination assumption 0.4 0.4 12.0 Recalculated value 0.8 1.0 1.8 36.5 Effect of a 1 year increase in life expectancy 1.0 1.0 30.0 Recalculated value 0.8 1.6 2.4 54.5 104 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2015 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued The above sensitivities assume that, with the exception of the annuity contracts, the Funds assets remain unchanged due to changes in assumptions, but in practice changes in market interest and ination rates will also affect the value of the Funds assets.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a long term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate.
This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the Fund by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the Fund.
In December 2008 and June 2009, certain obligations relating to retired members were fully hedged by the purchase of annuity contracts.
The Funds other investments include matching assets which protect against changes in bond yields and against ination risk.
The respective interest rate and ination hedge ratios for these assets as at 31 March 2015 were both 26% of those obligations not covered by annuity contracts.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income and expense in relation to the Fund.

26 Share based payment plans Group The Group has five share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long term incentive scheme under which awards are made to Directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder returns TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in adjusted basic earnings per share.
From 2009, the TSR element was increased from 50% to 60% of the awards granted.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of 7 years.
There were no awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2015 2014: nil.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme, which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
In June 2014, 1,467,484 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme at a price of 376 pence June 2013: nil.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP From 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares and from 2011 in share options with a vesting period of 3 years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares is charged over 4 years being the year the bonus was earned and the three-year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued or from 2011 over which nil cost options are granted and the share price at the date of issue.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, 65,086 deferred shares were awarded in relation to the year ended 31 March 2014 2014: nil.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2015 107 The numbers NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26 Share based payment plans continued The Dairy Crest Long Term Alignment Plan LTAP The LTAP replaced the LTISP in the year ended 31 March 2014.
This is a long term incentive scheme under which awards are made to Directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 50% of the award after 4 years and 50% after 5 years.
Pre-grant performance criteria determine the amount of any initial grant after which there are no significant performance conditions prior to vesting.
As such, these options are fair valued at 100% of the price at the date of the grant.
The Transformational Incentive Award TIA The TIA was granted, under the rules of the LTISP, in December 2014.
The TIA is a nil price option to acquire ordinary shares subject to certain performance objectives being met in addition to continuing employment.
The performance objectives relate to three categories detailed below: 1 managing the competition approval process relating to the proposed Dairies operation disposal: 2 appropriate reshaping of the Group, taking into account the competition approval process: and 3 establishing a successful future business, by reference to the development of the Group, including delivering value to shareholders.
The vesting period is three years from the date of grant.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2015 111 The numbers NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash ows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2014 and 2015, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objectives are: t to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at least 12 months: t to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years: t to maintain exibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds eg use of non-bank markets such as private placements : and t to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 19.
At 31 March 2015 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 393.3 million 2014: 414.0 million excluding finance leases of nil 2014: 1.8 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and Euro loan notes of 13.9 million 2014: 2.1 million.
The facilities at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 consisted of: t 170 million plus 90 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in October 2016: and t loan notes totalling 158.2 million repayable between April 2016 and November 2021.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2015 amounted to 130.1 million 2014: 208.4 million.
Effective headroom including cash and short term deposits amounted to 180.7 million 2014: 275.7 million.
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and by monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short term and long term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long term debt obligations with a oating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
The Groups long term strategy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at xed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued xed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps from time to time on a portion of its oating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between xed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash ow obligations.
In the short-term the proportion of xed and oating rate borrowings can go outside the long term range.
At 31 March 2015, 60% of the Groups borrowings were at a xed rate of interest 2014: 83%.
Following the maturity and repayment of loan notes in April 2014 and April 2013, the amounts drawn under revolving credit facilities have increased in 2014 15 and the xed rate percentage of borrowings has fallen.
In addition, there have been significant one-off cash ows in the year in relation to the Demineralised Whey and GOS and Spreads restructuring projects.
In the medium term we expect the xed proportion of borrowings to be in the target range.
The Groups borrowing facilities require minimum interest cover of 3.0 times.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 31.
Foreign currency risk The Group has no significant operations outside the UK.
However it buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
It can be seen in Note 16 that the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in US Dollar 2015: 1.9 million and Euro 2015: 1.3 million.
112 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2015 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be xed.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2006, 2007 and 2011 the Group issued loan notes denominated either in $US, or.
Cross-currency swaps were implemented as required to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash ows.
These have the effect of xing the liability and coupon in Sterling.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US or note debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassication of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy, which is generally contracted one season in advance for both summer and winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Commodity Risk Committee comprising senior operational and finance management and external advisers.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
The Dairies doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 153.6 million 2014: 189.3 million.
All revolving credit facility borrowings are through banks with long term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
At 31 March 2015 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 1.97 times March 2014: 1.31 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2015 or the prior year.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The analysis of net debt is included in Note 33.
The gearing ratio at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Net debt 198.7 142.2 Shareholders funds 289.8 289.4 Gearing ratio 69% 49% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 1.5 and 2.5 times.
The final proposed dividend for 2014 15 is 15.7 pence up 0.3 pence from last year 2014: 15.4 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2015 amount to 21.7 pence 2014: 21.3 pence.

Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classied as xed rate is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash ow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2015, 60% of Group borrowings were at xed rates of interest 2014: 83% see Note 30.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative xed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative oating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash ow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative oating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative xed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to oating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.

The table below summarises the maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2015 and 2014 based on contractual undiscounted payments of interest and principal.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts and the fair values of all of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements are the same, with the exception of the loan notes.
The carrying amount of the loan notes was 158.2 million and the fair value was 155.1 million.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
Cross currency swaps The notional principal amount of the outstanding $US GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2015 was $204.4 million 137.7 million 2014: $204.4 million 122.4 million.
These cross currency swaps have both legs at xed interest rates, are designated as cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
Any gains losses arising from fair value adjustments deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next one to eight years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2015 was 10.7 million 7.7 million 2014: 41.3 million 36.5 million.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement finance costs during the next year being the life of the swaps.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2015 115 The numbers NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 Financial instruments continued Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and any gains or losses deferred will then be reclassied to the income statement operating costs.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2015 of 130.1 million 2014: 208.4 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.
Undrawn facilities expire in October 2016.
