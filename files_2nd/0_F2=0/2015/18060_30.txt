Blasted material is laid on a slightly sloping, impervious pad and uniformly leached by the percolation of the leach liquor trickling through the beds by gravity to ponds.

An indicated mineral resource will be based on more data and therefore will be more reliable than an inferred resource estimate inferred resource As defined in the JORC Code, is that part of a mineral resource for which the tonnage and grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence.
It is inferred from the geological evidence and has assumed but not verified geological and or grade continuity.
It is based on information gathered through the appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards JORC Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and the Minerals Council of Australia LFSP Loan funded share plan LTI Lost time due to injury LTIFR Lost time injury frequency rate mill Equipment used to grind crushed rocks to the desired size for mineral extraction mineralisation Process of formation and concentration of elements and their chemical compounds within a mass or body of rock Moz Million ounces Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 151 Centamin plc Annual report 2015 sHaReHOlDeR inFORmatiOn Mt Million tonnes MTIFR Medical treatment injury frequency Mtpa Million tonnes per annum net production surplus or profit share Revenue less payment of the 3% royalty to Arab Republic of Egypt ARE and recoverable costs NCI Noncontrolling interest Nyota Nyota Minerals plc open pit Large scale hard rock surface mine ore Mineral deposit that can be extracted and marketed profitably ore body Mining term to define a solid mass of mineralised rock that can be mined profitably under current or immediately foreseeable economic conditions ore reserve The economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility studies, have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be reasonably justified.
