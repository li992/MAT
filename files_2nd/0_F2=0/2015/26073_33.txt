Financial statements 138 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the European embedded value Supplementary financial statements 1 Basis of presentation The Groups primary financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS asadopted by the European Union.
The Group has also prepared these supplementary financial statements inaccordance with the European Embedded Value Principles.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the EEV Principles issued in May 2004 by the European Insurance CFO Forum CFO Forum, and supplemented by the Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures published in October 2005.
The Directors believe that the supplementary statements appropriately reflect its underlying profitability whilst continuing to adhere to EEV Principles.
The Directors view is that embedded value reporting provides shareholders with additional information on the financial position and current performance of the Group to that otherwise provided in the primary financial statements.
Under the EEV method, the total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as that recognised under alternative reporting bases, but the timing of recognition is different.
The Group uses EEV methodology to value all lines of insurance business within Just Retirement Limited JRL or the Company, the covered business of the Group.
No other Group companies contain any covered business and the value of these companies has been included in the Group EEV at IFRS net asset value less the value of goodwill and intangibles to the extent that their recovery is supported by future profits.
The Directors of the Group are responsible for the preparation of these supplementary financial statements.
2 Methodology The following methodology applies to the covered business of the Group.
A. Embedded value overview In reporting under the EEV Principles, the Group has chosen to adopt a bottom-up approach to the allowance for risk.
The approach makes an explicit allowance for part of the spread that part being referred to as liquidity premium expected to be earned on corporate bonds and lifetime mortgages.
This has been achieved by increasing the discount rate used for valuing Retirement Income liabilities by that liquidity premium.
The embedded value is the sum of adjusted net worth of the Group companies, plus the value of in-force covered business, this being the present value of profits that will emerge over time.
The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the long-term business fund.
The shareholders net assets in respect of the life company have been derived from the annual regulatory returns submitted to the PRA.
The net worth represents the market value of the assets of the life company in excess of the insurance and non-insurance liabilities of the life company as assessed on the regulatory basis.
For other Group companies, the net worth is the IFRS net asset value less the value of goodwill and intangibles to the extent that their recovery is supported by future profits.
The value of in-force business is the present value of projected after-tax profits emerging in future from the current in-force business less the cost arising from holding the required capital to support the in-force business.
The future cash flows are projected using best estimate assumptions for each component of the cash flow.
The value of new business is the present value of projected after-tax profits emerging in future from new business sold in the period less the cost arising from holding additional capital to support this business.
The figures shown also include the additional expected return between the point of sale and the reporting date.
Covered business The business to which the EEV Principles have been applied is defined as the covered business.
The covered business includes all business written by the life company.
In particular: Long-term business operations.
This is business falling under the definition of long-term insurance business for UK regulatory purposes and principally comprises: Pension Guaranteed Income for Life Solutions: Defined Benefit fide-risking contracts: Capped Drawdown pension business contracts: and Care Plans.
In addition, some purchased life annuity business has been written, but this has not been written in significant volumes.
Although it has been allowed for in the calculations, it has not been explicitly modelled.
The impact of this approximate treatment is not material.
These are held as investments to back the pension GIfL and DB contracts.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 | 139 2 Methodology continued C. New business All of the covered business is written on a single premium basis.
New business is defined to be all single premiums received in the period in respect of Retirement Income policies completed in the period and all cash advances made during the period in respect of lifetime mortgages.
No allowance is made in the embedded value for the value of any future new business written after the reporting date.
For the value of new business, the Group has used economic assumptions determined at point of sale and has generally used opening period non-economic assumptions.
The Group considers point-of-sale economic assumptions, rather than economic assumptions determined at either the opening or closing dates, to be more appropriate given the nature of its business.
Any changes to non-economic assumptions and methodology in respect of new business are introduced at the reporting date.
The impact of these changes on the value of new business at the end of the year is therefore included within the analysis of the embedded value profit in the operating assumption changes.
D. Components of value The values of in-force business and new business each comprise four components: i Certainty equivalent value: less ii Time value of financial options and guarantees: less iii Allowance for non-market risk: less iv Cost of capital.
i Certainty equivalent value The certainty equivalent value is the value of the future cash flows, excluding the time value of financial options and guarantees.
It is calculated assuming assets earn the reference rate and the cash flows are discounted at the reference rate.
The future cash flows are those arising from the assets backing the liabilities as assessed on a regulatory basis and from the liabilities themselves.
The projection of the regulatory liabilities assumes the continuation of the bases used to calculate the liabilities at the valuation date.
The regulatory equivalent of the value of the provision for the guarantee described in ii below is included in the shareholders net assets and this is reversed out in the certainty equivalent value.
ii Time value of financial options and guarantees The only material financial options and guarantees within the covered business arise from the no-negative equity guarantee under the lifetime mortgage business.
Under this guarantee, the amount recoverable by the Group on termination of the mortgage is generally capped at the net sale proceeds of the property.
Circumstances where this guarantee does not apply are those where the mortgage redemption is not accompanied by a sale of the underlying property.
This could occur when, for example, the property is remortgaged with another provider.
This guarantee is explicitly allowed for in the calculations.
The value of this guarantee has been estimated using a variant of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula.
The formula incorporates a number of assumptions, including those for risk-free rates, future property growth and property volatility.
The value of the financial options and guarantee shown in the presentation is the total value of this guarantee, net of tax, assessed on a realistic basis it includes any intrinsic value in the option.
iii Allowance for non-market risk The key non-market or diversifiable risks faced by the Company are mortality including longevity, early redemptions on lifetime mortgages and operational risks.
In principle no explicit adjustment is required for non-market risks because the capital markets do not require an additional return for risks which can be diversified away.
However, this is only true if the assumptions made as regards future experience are set so as to give the mean of the expected outcome including allowing for the tails of the distribution and that all cash flows have been allowed for.
The Company has set the assumptions in respect of mortality and lifetime mortgage early redemptions with the intention that they give the mean of the expected outcome, including allowing for the tails of the distribution.
As such, no further adjustment has been made in respect of these risks.
However, the certainty equivalent value and the time value of financial options and guarantees make no allowance for the cost of possible operational risks and the Company has made an explicit allowance for these risks.
In the valuation approach used, the market or non-diversifiable risks faced by the Company are allowed for directly in the valuation of the cash flows.
Financial statements 140 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the European embedded value continued Supplementary financial statements continued 2 Methodology continued iv Cost of capital In addition to holding assets to back the covered business, the Company also has to hold additional shareholder capital to support the business.
The amount of capital has been assessed taking into account the Companys own internal assessment of its capital requirements and the amount required under the UK Solvency I regulatory environment.
The cost of capital represents the frictional costs of having to retain this capital.
The Group has taken these frictional costs to be any tax payable in respect of future investment returns earned on this capital and the associated investment management costs.
The required capital is provided by the retained surplus in the long-term business fund and the retained earnings and issued share capital in the shareholder fund.
E. Valuation of cash flows Within the calculation of the value of in-force business, the reference rate used for valuing the Retirement Income cash flows has been set equal to the mid-market swap rate, plus a liquidity premium adjustment.
At June 2015 the mortgage asset values used in the embedded value have been brought into line with the IFRS fair values calculated by discounting the future cash flows at a swap rate plus a liquidity premium.
To be consistent with the mortgage asset values the calculation of the liquidity premium adjustment in the value of in-force has changed and is calculated separately for both corporate bonds and lifetime mortgages backing the Retirement Income liabilities.
For corporate bonds the liquidity premium is calculated by deducting a prudent allowance for credit default risk from the overall average spread to swaps on the whole corporate bond portfolio.
For lifetime mortgages the liquidity premium is calculated by equating the present value of all the matching cash flows discounted at the swap rate plus the liquidity premium to the IFRS asset value of the matching mortgages.
The same approach has been used to value the lifetime mortgage cash flows that are not deemed to back the Retirement Income business.
i In-force business For the in-force business the liquidity premium adjustment has been derived using the method described above.
ii New business For new business written during the financial year the liquidity premium varies by the month of policy inception.
The liquidity premium adjustment applied to each months new business is consistent with the previous approach adopted at 30 June 2014 and is derived from the iBOXX Sterling Corporate Bond Index, as 50% of the Index Asset Swap Margin less 40bp where the value of the Index Asset Swap Margin for each months new business is a weighted average for the month using the amounts of Retirement Income premium received each day as the weights.
In the calculations it has been assumed that each months new lifetime mortgage business is available to match part of that months new annuity business and the remaining new Retirement Income cash flows are backed by bonds.
F. Reinsurance The Group has put in place reinsurance arrangements in respect of the GIfL business, whereby part of the mortality risk is transferred to the reinsurers.
In addition the Group receives an initial financing payment which is repayable out of future surplus emerging.
Some associated initial and renewal fees are also payable to the reinsurers.
The face value of the amount owed to the reinsurers at the relevant reporting date together with all management fees expected to be paid in the future has been explicitly allowed for in the value of the in-force business at the reporting date.
The risk transfer is not reflected in the EEV because, on the assumptions used, the Group expects to recapture the business once remaining financing has been repaid.
The Group has put in place separate reinsurance arrangements for the DB and Care Plan business.
Part of the mortality risk is transferred to the reinsurers by means of a mortality swap arrangement where JRL will pay reinsurance premiums equal to their share of expected claims according to the reinsurers mortality assessment, and the reinsurers will pay reinsurance claims equal to their share of actual payments made.
G. Taxation The projected cash flows take into account all tax which the Company expects to pay.
The calculations are undertaken assuming current tax legislation and rates continue unaltered.
Embedded value profits have been calculated on an after-tax basis and have then been grossed up at the full corporation tax rate to arrive at a pre-tax level for reporting in the Summarised statement of comprehensive income.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 | 141 3 Assumptions A.
Economic assumptions Reference rates The term structure of the reference rates has been derived from mid-market swap rates.
The resulting rates reflect the shape of the swap rate curve.
For new business the rates have been derived from the swap rates applicable on the date each payment was received for Retirement Income policies or the date each mortgage advance was completed as appropriate.
Sample mid-market swap rates at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 are shown in the following table.
Term years Swap rates at sample terms, % 1 5 10 20 30 30 June 2015 0.8 1.7 2.2 2.4 2.4 30 June 2014 0.9 2.2 2.8 3.2 3.2 The average in-force liquidity premium adjustment as at 30 June 2015 using the revised methodology was 178bp 2014: 51bp on previous methodology.
The liquidity premium adjustment for each months new business has varied over the financial year but the effect is equivalent to an average adjustment of 61bp 2014: 59bp for each months new business.
Residential property assumptions When calculating the value of the no-negative equity guarantee on the lifetime mortgages, certain economic assumptions are required within the variant of the Black-Scholes formula.
The market against which these assumptions have been assessed and the cost of the no-negative equity guarantee has been calibrated at any point in time is neither deep nor liquid.
The Group has therefore set these assumptions taking into account information available to it from within the capital markets linked to the assessment of the indicative costs of hedging out such exposures and published UK residential property historic price movements.
In the formula the risk-free rate used is the mid-market swap rate.
In the absence of a reliable long-term forward curve for UK residential property price inflation, the Group has assumed that residential property will grow in line with a bespoke house price inflation curve.
This has been derived by reference to mid-market UK retail price inflation swap rates together with an explicit term-dependent house price inflation spread.
Sample mid-market house price inflation rates at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 are shown in the following table.
Term years House price inflation rates at sample terms, % 1 5 10 20 30 30 June 2015 3.7 0.9 3.2 4.1 4.1 30 June 2014 2.1 1.3 3.4 4.2 4.2 In deriving an assessment of long-term UK residential property price volatility, the Group has used house price data published by the Nationwide Building Society.
The Group has adjusted the derived value to allow for the additional volatility expected to be observed in the Companys portfolio compared with the market as a whole.
The volatility assumption used at 30 June 2015 was 9.7% p. a.
The volatility assumption used for new business was 9.8% p. a.
Expense inflation For the Retirement Income products, the assumed future rate of increases in per policy maintenance expenses is 3.6% p. a.
2014: 3.7% p. a.. For the lifetime mortgages, the assumed future rate of increases in maintenance expenses is 3.8% p. a.
The difference reflects the difference in average duration of the cash flows and the shape of the RPI curve at the valuation date.
Taxation The rate of corporation tax assumed is 20% throughout being the effective tax rate at the valuation date 2014: 22.5%.
Financial statements 142 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the European embedded value continued Supplementary financial statements continued 3 Assumptions continued B.
Operating assumptions Operating assumptions have been reviewed as part of the reporting process.
Mortality The mortality assumptions have been set by the Group taking into account the Companys own mortality experience together with relevant studies undertaken by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries CMI, population studies undertaken by offices of the UK government, published research materials, input from the Groups lead reinsurer and managements own industry experience.
For the GIfL policies the mortality assumptions are based on the PCMA00 males and PCFA00 females mortality tables and the CMI 2014 model improvement factors.
These base factors are overlaid by a series of underwriting factors applied to the base mortality rates.
These adjustments are made to reflect the nature and likely incidence of the underlying risks inherent within the business written.
The underwriting factors applying to certain underwriting years have been reviewed as at 30 June 2015.
For DB policies the mortality basis is set with reference to the base table and mortality improvement rates provided by RGA i. e. the reinsurer with whom each DB scheme is reinsured.
For Care Plan policies the mortality basis is set with reference to the table provided by Gen Re i. e. the reinsurer with whom each INA policy is individually underwritten.
For the lifetime mortgages the mortality assumptions are based on the PCMA00 and PCFA00 mortality tables and the CMI 2012 model improvement factors.
These assumptions are unchanged from those used at 30 June 2014.
For Lump Sum Plus mortgages on standard terms the same mortality basis applies as used for the normal roll-up business.
The underlying basis for the mortgages is the same, with adjustments applied to reflect the nature and likely incidence of the underlying risks.
Mortgage repayments Assumptions are made about the number of future mortgage repayments resulting from individuals moving into long-term care or through voluntary repayments.
When deriving appropriate assumptions the Group has taken into account its own experience together with other relevant available information.
The decrement for moving into long-term care is expressed as a proportion of the underlying mortality assumption for the relevant lives.
The decrement for voluntary repayments is expressed as annual percentages of the portfolio in force and exhibits a term structure based on duration in force.
Expenses The expense levels are based on internal expense analysis investigations and are appropriately allocated to the new business and policy maintenance functions.
Acquisition expenses have been fully allocated to the values of new business for each product.
The Group has set maintenance expense allowances for each product which it considers to be realistic.
In calculating the embedded value, an adjustment has been made equal to the net present value of any expected future maintenance expense overruns.
Investment expenses have been set by reference to the expenses payable under the investment management arrangements.
Some of the expenses incurred in the financial period to 30 June 2015 have been considered exceptional and one-off in nature.
These non-recurring expenses have been identified separately and have not been included in the calculation of the value of in-force business or in the value of new business although they have been reflected in the operating profit.
Total non-recurring expenses for the year ended 30 June 2015 were 16.8m 2014: 10.8m.
The look-through principle has not been applied to the losses in the distribution company arising from the sale of products arising from the covered business, and so these losses have not been included as a deduction against the value of new business.
The distribution company is considered to be a stand-alone business and its activities do not relate solely to the sale of JRL products.
The recognised loss in the distribution company has been accounted for on an IFRS basis, separately to the results of the covered business.
The remaining expenses are included within operating results of the distribution and other Group companies and have been accounted for on an IFRS basis.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 | 143 3 Assumptions continued Non-market risk At 30 June 2015 the provision for non-market risk has been established as 0.18% of the best estimate reserves in respect of Retirement Income business.
This assumption is unchanged from that used as at 30 June 2014.
For the value of new business in the period to 30 June 2015, a deduction of 0.18% of best estimate reserves at point of sale has been applied.
Required capital At 30 June 2015 the assumed level of required capital to support the business represents 175% of JRLs long-term insurance capital requirement LTICR together with 175% of the resilience capital requirement RCR, as set out in PRA regulations.
4 Group embedded value The following table sets out the Group embedded value as at the current and previous reporting dates.

In order to explain better the movement in capital flows, the composition of the embedded value profit for the current year is shown separately between the movement in free surplus, required capital and the value of in-force business.
Total for Total for Value of year ended year ended Free Required in-force 30 June 30 June surplus capital business 2015 2014 m m m m m Opening embedded value 4.9 501.5 202.5 699.1 491.2 Expected return on opening embedded value 0.1 5.4 32.4 37.7 43.7 Expected surplus from in-force business 34.9 24.0 10.9 New business contribution 75.2 87.0 110.9 122.7 148.2 Operating experience variance 40.3 0.4 11.5 29.2 39.5 Operating assumption changes 18.4 12.0 7.0 0.6 45.2 Interest on Tier 2 loan 18.3 18.3 9.5 Operating profit for covered business 80.6 56.0 136.9 112.3 97.7 1 Economic variance 184.7 30.5 132.3 21.9 106.0 Embedded value profit before tax 265.3 86.5 269.2 90.4 203.7 Tax 37.1 53.8 16.7 45.8 Profit after tax 228.2 86.5 215.4 73.7 157.9 New capital 10.0 10.0 50.0 Closing embedded value 223.1 588.0 417.9 782.8 699.1 1 The economic variance of 23.4 m 2014: 106.5m reported in the Summarised statement of comprehensive income includes 1.5 m 2014: 0.5m in respect of the fair value movement on the interest rate swap derivatives held by Just Retirement Holdings Limited.
The expected return on opening embedded value is the expected change in the embedded value resulting from a projection of the assets and liabilities over the period using expected real world investment returns.
The expected surplus from in-force business represents the surplus expected to emerge during the period from business that was in force at the beginning of that period.
The effect is a transfer of value between the value of in-force business and shareholders net assets, with the overall effect on the embedded value being zero.
The new business contribution is the value of new business at the point of sale, together with the expected return on this value between the point of sale and the end of the period.
The operating experience variance represents the profits and losses caused by differences between the actual experience during the period and that expected on the operating assumptions, relating to both the business in force at the start of the period and new business written.
The operating assumption changes reflect changes in the assumptions in respect of future operating experience between the start and end of the period.
The economic variance arises from the impact of differences between the actual investment returns in the period and the expected investment returns, and the impact of the change to the end of period future economic assumptions.
Further impacts have arisen between the shareholders net assets and value of in-force business figures due to changes in the economic assumptions used in the regulatory reserving bases.
All of these impacts are calculated in relation to the start of period economic assumptions for business in force at the start of the period and point-of-sale economic assumptions for new business sold in the period.

9 Sensitivities The Group embedded value at 30 June 2015 and the value of new business for the year to 30 June 2015 have been recalculated to show the sensitivity of the results to changes in certain of the assumptions discussed above.
Most of the sensitivities are as prescribed by the additional guidance provided by the CFO Forum in October 2005.
There is no lapse surrender risk for the Retirement Income products and so no sensitivity to this assumption has been shown for this business.
The sensitivities chosen do not represent the boundaries of possible outcomes, nor are they intended to represent events of equal likelihood, but rather illustrate how certain alternative assumptions would affect the results.
For each of the sensitivities all the other assumptions remain unchanged, unless otherwise stated.
In all of the sensitivities, the statutory reserving basis was left unchanged, except for the first two where the valuation rate of interest was changed to reflect the sudden change in economic conditions.
Financial statements 146 | Just Retirement Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2015 Notes to the European embedded value continued 9 Sensitivities continued The sensitivities tested were: Interest rates 1% lower than in the central case with resulting changes in asset values and reference rates.
The impact for the values of new business has not been calculated for this sensitivity as the Group actively reviews its premium rates and in the event of such a sudden change in economic conditions the Group would change its rates.
Interest rates 1% higher than in the central case with resulting changes in asset values and reference rates.
Reference rates 10bp lower than in the central case, with no change in asset values.
The purpose of this sensitivity is to illustrate the impact of using a different definition of the reference rate than basing it on mid-market swap rates.
Credit spreads represented by the difference between corporate bond yields and swap rates 10bp narrower than in the central case.
For this sensitivity there is no change to the liquidity premium.
Credit spreads 10bp wider than in the central case.
Liquidity premium 10bp lower than in the central case in relation to the corporate bond element only.
Property market values 10% lower than in the central case.
Implied property volatility assumption 125% of the assumption in the central case.
Implied property volatility assumption 75% of the assumption in the central case.
Retirement Income customer base mortality 5% lower than in the central case i. e. 95% of the central mortality rates.
Lifetime mortgage base mortality 5% lower than in the central case i. e. 95% of the central mortality rates.
For this sensitivity, the allowance for moving into long-term care is also assumed to be 5% lower.
Lifetime mortgage voluntary redemption assumption 10% lower than in the central case i. e. 90% of the base case assumption.
Maintenance expenses 10% lower than in the central case i. e. 90% of base case costs including the resulting reduction in the maintenance expense overrun.
Corporation tax rate set to 19% i. e. 1% lower than in the central case.
