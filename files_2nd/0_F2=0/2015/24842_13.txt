The cash flows and the valuation are from the portfolio of 101 investments as at 31 March 2015 and does not include other assets or liabilities of the Group, and assumes that during the period illustrated above, i no new investments are purchased, ii no existing investments are sold and iii the Group suffers no material liability to withholding taxes, or taxation on income or gains.
The chart shows the steady long-term nature of the cash flows from the portfolio, coupled with a stable portfolio valuation to 2029.
The benefit of the new investments made in the year, increasing forecast cash flows and the valuation over time is also shown.
From 2030, based on current forecasts, the portfolio will move into a repayment phase whereby cash receipts from the portfolio will be paid to the Companys shareholders as capital and the portfolio valuation reduces as projects reach the end of their concession term, assuming that the proceeds are not invested in new investments, until 2047 when the last concession ends.
It is these forecast cash flows from the Groups current portfolio of investments that gives the Board the comfort that there should be sufficient cash cover for the revised target dividend of 7.45 pence per share for the year to 31 March 2016.
