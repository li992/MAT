Goodwill which arises from business combinations is not amortised, but is subject to a test for impairment at least annually.
During the year, the goodwill relating to the trust and tax business was found to be impaired as the growth forecasts for that business have not kept pace with cost inflation.
An impairment charge of 0.3 million was recognised in relation to this element of goodwill 2014: 0.4 million.
Further detail is provided in note 22 to the financial statements.
Capital expenditure During 2015, we have continued to invest for future growth with capitalised expenditure on our premises and systems totalling 5.8 million 2014: 4.6 million.
Investment in new systems continues at a steady pace as we continue to improve the efficiency of our systems and our back office.
Although some of this is driven by regulatory change, much is driven by our desire to optimise the service that our clients receive and to give our investment managers the tools they need to manage portfolios more easily.
New investment accounted for approximately 76% of capital expenditure in 2015, with the balance being maintenance and replacement of existing software and equipment.
This split is broadly consistent with the spending pattern in the recent past, although there was only very limited expenditure on property during the year.
During 2016, we expect to incur fit out costs of the new premises at 8 Finsbury Circus.
These costs will be capitalised and amortised over the period of the 17 year lease.
