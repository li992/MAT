Principal accounting policies Judgement and key areas of estimation The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires the Companys directors to exercise judgement in applying the Companys accounting policies.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in Note 3 and the consolidated financial statements.
Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
In the opinion of the Directors the value of such investments are not less than shown at the balance sheet date.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost where hedge accounting is not applied : any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Where fair value hedge accounting is applied, the borrowings are subsequently revalued at each balance sheet date and the difference is offset against the fair value movement of the derivative the hedging instrument in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has a continuing right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date under its committed bank credit facility.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 135 Notes to the Parent Company Accounts Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Pension commitments Rentokil Initial plc is the sponsoring company of a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme, Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS.
An actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme is carried out every three years.
The most recent actuarial valuation was at 31 March 2013.
Itwas carried out using the projected unit credit method and the principal assumptions made by the independent professional actuary are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of Rentokil Initial plc.
Financial instruments and risk management The Company policy in respect of financial instruments and risk management is disclosed in the Financing section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Disclosures have been made on financial instruments as required by the Companies Act 2006.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value of options over the Companys shares awarded to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as a capital contribution, resulting in an increase in investments.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the profit and loss account with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
See Note C12 of the consolidated financial statements for details of dividends paid in the year.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are shown below please refer to the notes in the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
Sensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the relevant notes to the consolidated accounts.
