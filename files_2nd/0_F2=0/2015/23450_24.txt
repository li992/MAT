19 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unlisted and listed companies, partnership interests, liquidity funds, trade receivables, trade payables and cash.
A loan facility, Zero Dividend Preference shares and Convertible Bonds, the purpose of which is the financing of new investment and refinancing of existing debt, and to finance on-market purchases of shares, other share buy-backs and tender offers.
Interest rate Swaps and Caps in order to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation in interest payable on the new multi-currency loan facility.
The main risks arising from the Groups and Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
The financial risks of the Company are aligned to the Groups financial risks.
78 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 19 Financial Instruments continued Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its fund investments, listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
For listed investments and liquidity funds the market risk variable is deemed to be the price itself.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these prices, is set out in part ii of this Note.
For unlisted equity and non-equity shares the market risk is deemed to be the price earnings ratio or other appropriate valuation methodology as set out in the accounting policy.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these variables, is set out in part vii of this Note.
Foreign Currency Risk The Companys total return and net assets are affected by foreign exchange translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held are denominated in or impacted by currencies other than sterling.
The foreign investments held are principally held in the USA, Continental Europe and Asia.
During the year, the Company held loans denominated in US Dollars and Euro, which partially offset foreign currency risk on foreign currency investments.
The impact on profit after tax and on shareholders equity of 10% increases and decreases in the value of US Dollars and Euro, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are analysed in part iii of this Note.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including realised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through the multi-currency facility, ZDP and Convertible Bonds.
During the year, a long-term multi-currency loan facility was in existence.
The multi-currency facility has a floating rate of interest.
The Convertible Bonds have a fixed rate of interest.
Interest rate swap and cap derivatives are utilised to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation in interest payable on the multi-currency facility.
The cash balances held on deposit mitigate in part the interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities and the impact of the profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity of a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are shown in part iv of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term receivables and payables.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares, fixed income securities and liquidity funds.
Whilst the unlisted equity is intentionally illiquid, short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility, and liquidity funds which are relatively liquid and cash which is available on demand.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in part v of this Note.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 79 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview 19 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its investment in liquidity funds and its cash deposits.
Only major banks with market capitalisation above 20 billion are used when making cash deposits and the level of cash is reviewed on a regular basis.
A well-diversified portfolio of liquidity funds is maintained with no more than 10% of gross assets held with any one institution.
The total invested in liquidity funds was nil with associated accrued income of nil 2014: 120,000,000 with associated accrued income of 31,000.
The cost of this investment was nil 2014: 120,000,000.
Cash held on deposit was principally with three UK banks see table below and totalled 147,123,000 2014: 198,271,000.

In doing so the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders whilst remaining within the restrictions imposed by its investment trust status, return capital to shareholders, change the level of borrowing in the 275,000,000 committed multi-currency revolving credit facility or issue new shares or debt.
During the year the Group paid an interim dividend of 13,621,000 2014: nil.
The Group manages the levels of cash deposits held whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity for investments.
The Group has an existing authority to implement an on-market share buy-back programme to generate shareholder value.
During the year nil 2014: nil was utilised to repurchase shares for cancellation.
The level of outstanding borrowings is reviewed on an on-going basis taking into account future levels of investment, realisations, dividends and share buybacks.

The Group has adopted IFRS 13 in respect of disclosures about the degree of reliability of fair value measurements.
This requires the Group to classify, for disclosure purposes, fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The following table represents the Groups assets by hierarchy levels: All fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 83 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview 19 Financial Instruments continued Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As at 30 September 2015 m m m m Unlisted and listed investments 1,630 101 1,529 1,630 101 1,529 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As at 30 September 2014 m m m m Unlisted and listed investments 1,272 91 1,181 Liquidity funds 120 120 Interest rate swaps 1 1 1,391 211 1 1,181 Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are therefore classified within Level 1, include active listed equities.
The Group does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments.
Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2.
Investments classified within Level 3 make use of significant unobservable inputs in deriving fair value, as they trade infrequently.
As observable prices are not available for these securities, the Group has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value.
Investments classified within Level 3 consist of private equity direct investments and fund and secondary positions.
The main inputs into the Groups valuation models for private equity investments are EBITDA multiples based on the budgeted EBITDA or most recent EBITDA achieved or a rolling 12 months basis of the issuer and equivalent corresponding EBITDA multiples of comparable listed companies, quality of earnings assessments, assessments of third party external debt, marketability discounts, cost of capital adjustments and probabilities of default.
The Group also considers the original transaction prices, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments and completed third-party transactions in comparable companies instruments and adjusts the model as deemed necessary.
In determining the valuation recommended to the Directors for the Groups equity instruments, the Manager uses comparable trading multiples in arriving at the valuation for private equity.
In accordance with the Groups policy, the Manager determines appropriate comparable public companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation and strategy.
The Manager then calculates a trading multiple for each comparable company identified.
The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its EBITDA.
The trading multiple is then adjusted for discounts premiums with regards to such considerations as illiquidity and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the Groups portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.
The value of private equity funds is primarily based on the latest available financial capital account statement of the private equity fund.
The Company may make adjustments to the value as set out in Note 25.
As at 30 September 2015 10% 2014: 15% of financial assets at fair value comprise investments in private equity funds that have been valued in accordance with the policies set out in Note 25.
The private equity funds are not publicly traded and prior to maturity an exit can only be made by the Company through a sale of its investment and commitment through a secondary market.
The carrying values of the private equity funds may be significantly different from the values ultimately realised on an exit via a secondary market sale.

Details of these schemes are as follows: Long term incentive scheme LTI Under this scheme participants invested in every new investment made by Electra between 1995 and March 2006.
In return, the participants are entitled to a percentage of the total capital and revenue profits made on each such investment.
The participants do not receive any profit until Electra has received back its initial investment.
1995 LTI Participants are entitled to a percentage of the incremental value of unlisted investments held at 31 March 1995, subject to Electra having received total proceeds equal to the valuation of those investments as at 31 March 1995 plus a preferred return.
The Initial Pool This relates to a pool of investments valued at 160 million at 31 March 2006 the initial pool.
Under this arrangement participants are entitled to 10% the carried interest of the aggregate realised profits of the initial pool.
The realised profits are calculated as being the aggregate of income and sale proceeds received by Electra less the 160 million opening value, less any additional purchases and less priority profit share.
Carried interest is payable only once realised profits exceed a preferred return of 15% compounded annually on the opening value of the initial pool plus the cost of further investments less realisations.
A full catch-up is payable once the realised profits of the initial pool exceed the preferred return.
This catch-up means that all proceeds above the cumulative preferred return accrue to participants until they have been paid an amount equating to 10% of the total realised profits of the initial pool.
Thereafter proceeds are split 90%:10% between Electra and the participants.
2006, 2009 and 2012 Pools In October 2006 new arrangements were entered into in respect of investments made over each consecutive three year period.
At the reporting date such arrangements are in operation in relation to the three year periods from 2006 to 2009, 2009 to 2012 and 2012 to 2015 investments being made in each such period being referred to as a pool.
Under these arrangements participants are entitled to a carried interest of 18% of the aggregate realised profits in relation to direct investments in each pool.
The realised profits are calculated as being the aggregate of income and sale proceeds received by Electra less the purchase costs of investments and less priority profit share.
Carried interest is payable only once realised profits exceed a preferred return of 8% compounded annually on the cost of investments less realisations.
A full catch-up is payable once the realised profits exceed the preferred return.
This catch-up means that all proceeds above the cumulative preferred return accrue to participants until they have been paid an amount equating to 18% of the total realised profits.
Thereafter proceeds are split 82%:18% between Electra and the participants.
Similar arrangements are in place for indirect investments, the difference from the above arrangements being that the carried interest is 9% over an 8% preferred return.
No Directors of Electra participate in the above schemes.

The co-investment agreement required Electra to co-invest at the ratio of 2:1 in all Electra Partners investments in private equity opportunities in Western Europe where the combined investment of Electra and the Club would represent a controlling stake and where the combined equity investment is between 25 million to 75 million.
Both parties invested on the same terms and conditions.
The agreement allowed for variations to these arrangements in certain prescribed circumstances, for example, where investment would compromise Electras ability to qualify as an Investment Trust or where the Club would exceed certain concentration ratios.
Investments that arise from interests that Electra already held prior to the establishment of the Club are unaffected by these sharing arrangements.
These arrangements expired in May 2013.

From 1 April 2015, the following changes were made: no fee was paid on cash: and the management fee on Non-Core listed and Primary Fund Investments was reduced to 1%.
In the year to 30 September 2015 3,582,000 2014: 7,135,000 deal fees were charged by Electra in relation to new investments.
These fees are accounted for within the investment income line in the financial statements.
Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements, Electra Partners is entitled to receive 50% of the aggregate deal fees in excess of abort costs.
This is achieved by increasing the priority profit share for the period by the relevant amount.
These amounts are shown in the table above.
In addition Electra Partners charged portfolio companies 1,659,000 in relation to directors and monitoring fees 2014: 2,269,000 in relation to directors, monitoring and corporate finance fees.

94 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 22 Related Party Transactions continued Remuneration Disclosure The AIFMD requires certain disclosures to be made in relation to the remuneration of the Managers staff during the financial year.
Year ended Period 11 July 30 Sept 2015 to 30 Sept 2014 000 000 Remuneration paid by the Manager to its partners 3,513 429 Carried Interest paid to the partners of the Manager 20,745 nil Total 24,258 429 Electra Partners LLP substantially reorganised its group structure as part of its AIFMD variation of permission application which took effect from 11 July 2014.
As a consequence the partners and remuneration structures in place within Electra Partners LLP prior to 11 July 2014 do not accurately reflect the partners and remuneration structures in place following Electra Partners LLPs AIFMD reorganisation and we consider that any disclosure of the remuneration paid prior to that date will not accurately reflect the steps taken to ensure AIFMD compliance.
In line with the FCAs guidance on the AIFMD remuneration code, we consider that since there has not yet been a full performance period following the implementation of Electra Partners LLPs AIFMD reorganisation it would be unhelpful to provide complete comparative remuneration disclosure for the financial years ended 30 September 2015 or 2014 because it would not be materially relevant and would not be a proper basis for comparison.
However, Electra Partners LLP considers it appropriate to disclose that the total remuneration paid to its partners for the year ended 30 September 2015 and in the period 11 July 2014 to 30 September 2014 by Electra Partners LLP as an AIFM, substantially all of which relates to the management of Electra, was as disclosed above.
The remuneration paid by the Manager in the period was fixed remuneration with no variable remuneration being paid and the number of beneficiaries was ten for the year ended 30 September 2015 and was eight in the period from 11 July 2014 to 30 September 2014.
All those concerned are partners of the Manager who are also its senior management.
Following successful disposals made in 2014 and 2015 the same individuals received during the year ended 30 September 2015 aggregate profit distributions as set out above in respect of their carried interest investments in partnerships through which Electra invests.
Remuneration Policy Following the AIFMD reorganisation referred to above, Electra Partners LLP has reviewed its remuneration policies and procedures in order to ensure that incentives are aligned with the detailed requirements of the AIFMD.
Electra Partners LLPs remuneration policy includes measures to avoid conflicts of interest such as: The remuneration of all the Managers partners is in the form of fixed drawings of profit allocations determined by a formula fixed in advance of any annual period in which remuneration is paid.
No variable or performance related remuneration is paid to any of the Managers partners.
The Manager will not pay remuneration for potential future revenues whose timing and likelihood remain uncertain.
The only individuals who receive remuneration are all equity partners of Electra Partners LLP and all are members of its Management Committee.

Accordingly, the Board has resolved to exercise this right and proposes to issue the Mandatory Conversion Notice to Bond holders in November 2015.
Following the issue of the Mandatory Conversion Notice, the Bonds will convert into ordinary shares on 29 December 2015.
Bond holders will receive further details about the Mandatory Conversion in the Mandatory Conversion Notice once posted.
25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies The Financial Statements for the year ended 30 September 2015 have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
IFRS comprises standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC as adopted in the European Union as at 30 September 2015.
In order to reflect the activities of an investment trust company, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Income Statement.
In analysing total income between capital and revenue returns, the Directors have followed the guidance contained in the Statement of Recommended Practice for investment companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009 the SORP.
The recommendations of the SORP which have been followed include: Realised and unrealised profits or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments classified as held at fair value through profit or loss should be shown in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Realised gains are taken to the realised reserves in equity and unrealised gains are transferred to the unrealised reserves in equity.
Returns on any share or debt security whether in respect of dividends, interest or otherwise should be shown in the revenue column of the income statement.
The total of the revenue column of the Income Statement is taken to the revenue reserve in equity.
The Board should determine whether the indirect costs of generating capital gains should also be shown in the capital column of the Income Statement.
If the Board decides that this should be so, the management fee should be allocated between revenue and capital in accordance with the Boards expected long term split of returns, and other expenses should be charged to capital only to the extent that a clear connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
The Board has decided that the Company should continue to charge priority profit share and finance costs, other than those in relation to the Zero Dividend Preference shares, as revenue items for the year ended 30 September 2015.
96 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and accordingly has not presented a separate parent company income statement.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of certain assets at fair value, as disclosed in the Principles of Valuation of Investments.
Application of New Standards The accounting policies used are consistent with those applied in the last annual financial statements, as amended to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments, and interpretations which became effective in the year.
During 2015, the following relevant standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed by the EU became effective for the first time: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements revised : IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures revised : IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation amendment : IAS 36 Impairment of Assets amendment : and Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 transition guidance.
None of the other standards, amendments and interpretations above have had an impact on the consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.
Other pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements, but may result in changes to presentation or disclosure.
Additionally a number of standards have been issued but are not yet adopted by the EU and so are not available for early adoption.
The most significant of these is IFRS 9 Financial Instruments along with related amendments to other IFRSs and the impact on the Group is being reviewed.
None of these standards, amendments and interpretations are presently expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Where subsidiaries are acquired or sold during the year their results are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition and up to the date of disposal respectively.
A subsidiary is an entity where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The principal subsidiaries comprise wholly owned companies and near wholly owned investment holding limited partnerships set up by the Company through which investments are made and through which external borrowings for investment purposes are raised.
The holdings in investment holding limited partnerships and wholly owned investment holding companies are included in the consolidated Financial Statements, on the basis that they are considered to be special purpose entities of the Company, which have been set up for the specific purpose of holding investments.
The amendments to IFRS 10 and 12 define an investment entity and introduce an exception from the consolidation requirements for investment entities.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 97 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued The Company has been deemed to meet the definition of an investment entity per IFRS 10 as the following conditions exist The Company has multiple unrelated investors which are not related parties, and holds multiple investments.
Ownership interests in the Company are exposed to variable returns from changes in the fair value of the Companys net assets.
The Company has obtained funds for the purpose of providing investors with investment management services.
The Companys business purpose is investing solely for returns from capital appreciation and investment income.
The performance of investments are measured and evaluated on a fair value basis.
The Company has therefore continued to measure its investment in each subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the investment entity exception.
Investments The Board has appointed Electra Partners LLP Electra Partners, an independent investment manager, under a contract of full discretionary management to manage the investments of the Company.
This is effected through the Management and Investment Guideline Agreement and the relevant limited partnership agreements of the investment holding limited partnerships through which the Company makes its investments.
Under these agreements, Electra Partners as Manager has full power to exercise the voting rights attaching to any of the Companys investments without reference to the Board.
Consequently, the Company does not have the power to participate in or govern the financial and operating policies of any of its investments and therefore even where the holding is greater than 50% of the equity, or between 20% and 50% of the equity, investments are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method respectively.
Purchases and sales of listed investments are recognised on the trade date where a contract exists whose terms require delivery within a time frame determined by the relevant market.
Purchases and sales of unlisted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.
Investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss described in the Financial Statements as investments held at fair value and are subsequently measured at reporting dates at fair value.
The fair value of direct unquoted investments is calculated in accordance with the Principles of Valuation of Investments below.
Changes in the fair value of investments are recognised in the Income Statement through the capital column.
Principles of Valuation of Investments i General In valuing investments, Electra Partners values investments at Fair Value at the reporting date, in accordance with IFRS 13 and IPEV guidelines.
Fair Value represents the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
In estimating Fair Value, the Manager uses a methodology which is appropriate in light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment and its materiality in the context of the total investment portfolio.
Methodologies are applied consistently from one period to another except where a change results in a more accurate estimate of Fair Value.
ii Unlisted Investments The principal methodologies applied in valuing unlisted investments at the measurement date include the following: Earnings multiple Price of recent investment Net assets Discounted cash flows Industry valuation benchmarks Exit price 98 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued In assessing whether a methodology is appropriate the Manager will be biased towards those methodologies that draw heavily on market based measures of risk and return, favouring those that rely on observable market data rather than assumptions.
Typically an earnings multiple basis will be used.
In applying the earnings multiple methodology, the Manager applies a market based multiple that is appropriate and reasonable to the maintainable earnings of the portfolio company.
In the majority of cases the Enterprise Value of the underlying business is derived by the use of an earnings multiple applied to the current years earnings where these can be forecast with a reasonable degree of certainty and are deemed to represent the best estimate of maintainable earnings.
Where this is not the case, historic earnings will generally be used in their place.
The Enterprise Value of the underlying business will be calculated using the earnings multiple or other appropriate basis as above : The Enterprise Value of the underlying business will then be adjusted for surplus assets, in particular surplus cash or excess liabilities to arrive at an Enterprise Value for the portfolio company: and The valuation of Electras investment will be calculated from the Enterprise Value for the portfolio company after deduction of prior ranking debt and other financial instruments.
The Manager will normally derive the earnings multiple by reference to current market based multiples reflected in the valuations of quoted comparable companies or the price at which comparable companies have changed ownership.
Differences between the comparator multiple and the unquoted company being valued are reflected by adjusting the multiple for points of difference.
The reasons why such adjustments may be necessary include the following: Size and diversity of the entities Rate of growth of earnings Reliance on a small number of key employees Diversity of product ranges Diversity and quality of customer base Level of borrowing Any other reason the quality of earnings may differ Risks arising from the lack of marketability of the shares Where a recent investment has been made, either by Electra or by a third party in one of Electras investments, after considering the background of the underlying investment, this price will generally be used as the estimate of Fair Value, subject to consideration of changes in market conditions and company specific factors.
Other methodologies, as detailed above, may be used at any time if this is deemed to provide a more accurate assessment of the Fair Value of the investment.
The indicators that the price of recent investment may no longer be appropriate include: Significant under over achievement of budgeted earnings Concerns with respect to debt covenants or refinancing Significant movements in the market sector of the investment Regulatory changes in the industry The Managers valuation model for debt instruments is the net present value of estimated future cash flows based on a discounted cash flow model.
The discount rate used by the Company is based on the risk-free rate of the economic environment in which portfolio companies operate and is adjusted in relation to other factors such as liquidity, credit and market risk.
Similar to the earnings multiple model the cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are based on projected cash flow or earnings of the portfolio companies.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 99 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued iii Listed Investments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
iv Limited Partnership Funds Limited partnership funds are those set up by a third party where the Company does not hold a majority share and are at fair value, typically using the third party managers valuation after adjustment for purchases and sales between the date of the valuation and the measurement date.
v Other Investments Liquidity funds are held at the current Fair Value of the note.
vi Subsidiary Undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company Statement of Financial Position at the Fair Value of the subsidiary.
Accrued Income Accrued income is included within investment valuations.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on its borrowings.
This is achieved by the use of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
All derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of currency swaps and interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and exchange rates.
All changes in the fair value of financial instruments are accounted for in the Income Statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months.
Foreign Currencies The Groups presentational currency and the Companys functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling sterling, since that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currencies of the Groups respective entities at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are recognised through the Income Statement.
At each balance sheet date assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of the equity and reserves of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than sterling, are recognised directly in the Translation Reserve in equity.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Income Statement for the period.
100 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Investment Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are accounted on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are accounted when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield when it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group.
Where income accruals previously recognised, but not received, are no longer considered to be reasonably expected to be received, either through investee company restructuring or doubt over its receipt, then these amounts are reversed through expenses.
Income distributions from limited partnership funds are recognised when the right to distribution is established.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except for expenses in connection with the disposal and acquisition of non-current asset investments, which are deducted from the disposal proceeds and added to acquisition costs of investments.
Finance Costs Costs of borrowings are expensed as revenue items through the Income Statement as they accrue on an effective interest rate basis.
Any costs incurred which were not directly related to the borrowing facility are expensed in the revenue account.
Priority Profit Share The majority of the investments are made by the Company through investment holding limited partnerships managed by Electra Partners.
Under the terms of the relevant limited partnership agreements the general partner is entitled to appropriate, as a first charge on the net income or net capital gains of the limited partnerships, an amount equivalent to its priority profit share.
In periods in which the investment holding limited partnerships have not yet earned sufficient net income or net capital gain to satisfy this priority profit share the entitlement is carried forward to the following period.
In all instances the cash amount paid to the general partner in each period is equivalent to the priority profit share.
The priority profit share is charged wholly to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expense loss is allocated between capital and revenue on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Zero Dividend Preference Shares Zero Dividend Preference Shares which exhibit the characteristics of debt are recognised as liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position in accordance with IAS 32.
After initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost, which represents the initial net proceeds from the issuance after issue costs plus the accrued entitlement to the balance sheet date.
The accrued entitlement is calculated as the difference between the proceeds on the issue of these shares and the redemption amount at maturity and is charged as interest expense over the life of these shares using the effective interest method.
In accordance with the AIC SORP this interest expense is allocated to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 101 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Convertible Bonds The Bond, in accordance with IFRS, has been treated as a compound financial instrument that contains both a liability and an equity component.
The economic effect of issuing the instrument is substantially the same as issuing both a debt instrument with an obligation to payment of interest and principal assuming it is not converted and an equity instrument a written call option granting the holder the right for a specified period of time to convert into a fixed number of ordinary shares.
The proceeds from issuing Convertible Bonds are split on Electras Statement of Financial Position into its constituent parts of debt and equity in accordance with the requirement of IFRS.
The fair value of the debt element of the bond has been calculated by using a market rate of interest for a similar borrowing that does not include an equity component or a conversion option.
The rate used for these purposes was 9.9%, which, using discounted cash flow, gives a fair value for the debt component of 73 million.
The fair value of the equity element is calculated by deducting the fair value of debt from the issue value of the Bond.
Finance costs are taken to the Income Statement and are calculated as the yield to maturity of the fair value of the debt component of the Bond.
On conversion the value of the Bonds converted will be debited to long-term liabilities.
The nominal value of the ordinary shares issued on conversion will be credited to share capital and the balance representing the excess of conversion proceeds over nominal value of the shares will be credited to the share premium account.
On conversion, the fair value of the equity element will be credited to the revenue reserve and debited to other reserves.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made.
The provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Changes in provisions are recognised in the Income Statement.
The provision for the incentive schemes is based on the valuation of investments as at the balance sheet date.
The incentive scheme is charged to the capital column of the Income Statement as a direct cost.
Revenue and Capital Reserves Net Capital return is taken to the Capital Reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The net revenue return is taken to the Revenue Reserve.
Bank Loans Bank loans are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the loan.
After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the liabilities.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments more than 30 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within selling and marketing costs.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against selling and marketing costs in the income statement.
102 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 25 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Trade Payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share Capital Ordinary shares issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds or fair value received with the excess of the amount received over nominal value being credited to the share premium account.
Direct issue costs net of tax are deducted from equity.
Going Concern The Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key Estimates and Assumptions Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial information are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments.
These are valued by Electra Partners in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 13.
Judgement is required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology under this standard and subsequently in determining the inputs into the valuation model used.
These judgements include making assessments of the future earnings potential of portfolio companies, appropriate earnings multiples to apply, and adjustments to comparable multiples.
