FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Continued The fair value adjustment relates to the Groups fixed rate loans with Lloyds Bank plc, Partnership Assurance Group plc, UniCredit Bank AG, Just Retirement Limited and the Corporate Bond, all of which are stated at amortised cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The fair value of these fixed rate loans is calculated as 479.3m 2014: 400.4m.
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The Groups policies on financial risk management are approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by Group treasury.
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance is monitored by internal audit.
Group treasury reports to the Board Risk and Compliance Committee.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for speculative purposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in relation to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
The Groups financial interest in property assets relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of England Pensions Board as mortgagee, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
The Group sometimes enters entered into sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration is deferred.
Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale and the Group retains a legal charge over the land until full and final settlement is received.
At 30 September 2015, nil 2014: 4.0m was outstanding from no 2014: one counterparties.
In addition, at 30 September 2014, 35.0m deferred consideration was due from a portfolio sale in the Retirement Solutions division see Note 40 for further details of movements in 2015.
The Group had some protection from credit risk by a call option over the entire share capital of the entity sold to the counterparty.
The Groups principal credit risk relates to trade receivables.
Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for impairment is made.
For all Assured Shorthold Tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant.
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy, agreement to avoid default on their rent.
Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk.
Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables is considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
Tenant deposits of 1.5m 2014: 1.9m are held that provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused by the tenant.
The Group does not hold any other collateral as security.
Of the net trade receivables balance of 21.4m, we consider 14.8m to be not due and not impaired.
Of the 2.3m other receivables balance, 1.2 is considered not due and not impaired.
130 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 29.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Continued As at 30 September 2015, tenant arrears of 1.8m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for 2014: 2.2m.
The individually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability.
The ageing of these receivables is: 2015 2014 m m Up to two months 0.2 0.1 Three months or more 1.6 2.1 1.8 2.2 Rental receivables are due on demand and hence all balances outstanding at the year end are past due.
The balances within trade receivables that are past due but are not considered to be impaired, because we have either collected the debt since the statement of financial position date or there is a history of regular payment, are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Up to two months 1.5 2.2 Three months or more 0.7 2.2 2.2 The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Groups policies of monitoring counterparty exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good financial standing.
At 30 September 2015, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive value was 2.0m 2014: nil.
At 30 September 2015, the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate swaps was 90.8m 2014: 74.4m, which represents 4.7% 2014: 4.2% of total assets.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with A-or better credit ratings.
The Group has the following cash and cash equivalents: 2015 2014 m m Pounds Sterling 83.5 66.3 Euros 5.3 7.9 Czech Koruna 0.2 88.8 74.4 Cash and cash equivalents can be analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Cash at bank 84.8 63.8 Short-term deposits 4.0 10.6 88.8 74.4 Included within 2015 year end cash balances is 10.6m 2014: 9.0m held in third-party client accounts where Grainger acts as trustee or agent.
The corresponding liability is included within trade payables.
At the year end, 4.0m was placed on deposit 2014: 10.6m at effective interest rates between 0.4% and 0.5% 2014: 0.42% and 0.5%.
Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 1.0 as at 30 September 2015 2014: 5m.
Strategic report Governance Financials 131 Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the Groups core funding is supported by covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in the Group of obligors and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured directly against any property allowing operational flexibility.
The Group has operated well within its covenants during 2015 and as at 30 September 2015 seeNote 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
The Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times.
The Group uses short-term money market deposits to manage its liquidity.
The Group also ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational flexibility and to meet committed expenditure.
The business is very cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross rents and management fees.
In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be stopped.
Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the statement of financial position date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts will not equal the amounts disclosed on the statement of financial position for borrowings, derivative financial instruments, trade and other payables and provisions for liabilities and charges.
A reconciliation to the statement of financial position amounts is given below for borrowings only.
Trade and other payables due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The cash flows are calculated using yield curves for floating rate interest-bearing liabilities.
Foreign currency related cash flows are calculated by means of the forward rates relevant to each maturity date.

The Group internally measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses.
The Directors consider that a - 1 percent 2014: 1 percent movement in interest rates, a - 10 percentage point 2014: 10percentage point movement in Sterling and a - 1 percentage point 2014: 1 percentage point movement in house prices represents a reasonable possible change.
The approach the Group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The Group is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Strategic report Governance Financials 133 Fair values IFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value.
These are as follows: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
As all significant inputs required to value the swaps are observable, they all fall within Level 2.
The CHARM portfolio falls within Level 3, inputs not based on observable market data.
The significant unobservable inputs affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and effective interest rate.
Further details regarding the basis of valuation and the sensitivity to changes in the key valuation assumptions are documented in Note 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
Note 22 provides a reconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income.
The Tricomm Housing portfolio falls within Level 3.
The Investment valuation provided by Allsop LLP, which is based on a discounted cash flow model in accordance with RICs Professional Valuation Standards 2014, includes a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions.
Further details of these assumptions and significant unobservable inputs are documented in Note 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
The reconciliation between opening and closing balances is detailed in the table below.
2015 2014 m m Opening balance 109.1 105.9 Amounts taken to income statement 2.4 3.2 Closing balance 111.5 109.1 The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

As trading property is only shown at market value within the Groups non-GAAP NAV and NNNAV measures it has been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table above.
If the market value of trading property were included it would fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13.
The statutory book value of trading property is 1,152.2m and its market value is 687.7m higher at 1,839.9m.
The Groups fixed rate loans are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised cost.
As the fixed rate loans are only shown at fair value in the Groups non-GAAP NAV and NNNAV measures they have been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table above.
Had they been included they would fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13.
The statutory book value of fixed rate loans is 446.9m and their fair value is 479.3m.
134 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 29.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Continued Interest rate swaps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 30 September 2015 was 357.0m 2014: 334.2m.
All of the financial derivatives included in the above table were valued by external consultants, J C Rathbone Associates Limited, using adiscounted cash flow model and market information and were checked internally using a software package.
In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair value are taken directly to the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, and have been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to other comprehensive income through the cash flow hedge reserve.
A valuation was carried out at 30 September 2015 by external consultants, J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to calculate the market value of the Groups fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between the fixed interest rates for the Groups borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rate of appropriate debt instruments, as a fair value adjustment.
The fair values compared to the carrying amounts of the Groups fixed rate financial liabilities are analysed below.
Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September 2015 2015 m m Fixed rate loan facilities 464.8 497.2 Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September 2014 2014 m m Fixed rate loan facilities 401.1 418.6 Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The Group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
This subjects the Group to fair value risk as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the Group seeks to cash flow hedge accounts where applicable.
The Group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Groups hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure compliance with this policy.
The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current Group treasury policy is to maintain floating-rate exposure of no greater than 40% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2015, 77% 2014: 68% of the Groups net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 4.2m 2014: 3.9m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 4.2m 2014: 3.9m.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the Groups equity by 3.3m 2014: 3.1m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase the Groups equity by 3.3m 2014: 3.1m.
Upward movements in mediumand long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the interest yield curve.
Where the Groups swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
Strategic report Governance Financials 135 As at 30 September 2015, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 5.0m 2014: 5.2m.
The total ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges recognised within the income statement totals a gain of 0.4m 2014: 0.4m.
The fair value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships and amounts reclassified from equity to the income statement amounted, in aggregate, to a charge of 5.8m 2014 credit: 1.2m in the income statement analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Fair value movement on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges 6.2 3.0 Amounts reclassified from equity to the income statement 0.4 1.8 5.8 1.2 At 30 September 2015, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 28.5m 2014: 42.8m.
The cash flows occur and enter in the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.

136 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 29.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Continued Foreign exchange risk The Groups foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading performance and overseas net assets into Sterling.
The Group does not have foreign currency trading with cross border currency flows.
The Group hedges foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
Profit translation is not hedged.
The Groups statement of financial position translation exposure is summarised below: 2015 2014 2015 2014 Czech Czech Euro Euro Koruna Koruna m m m m Gross foreign currency assets 89.2 84.2 0.8 Gross foreign currency liabilities 83.3 93.5 7.8 Net exposure 5.9 9.3 0.8 7.8 As at 30 September 2015, it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Euro would decrease increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.2m 2014: 0.3m and equity by 0.5m 2014: 6.1m.
As at 30 September 2015, it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Czech Koruna would decrease increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately nil 2014: nil and equity by 0.1m 2014: 0.7m.
Credit availability risk Credit availability risk relates to the Groups ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional financing where necessary.
The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom through cash and committed borrowings.
On 11 August the Group drew down on its new syndicate bank facility which had been due to mature in July 2016.
The new facility amounted to 580m.
Since the year end, on 1 October 2015 the Group concluded the re-financing of its Grainger Invest banking facility with HSBC and Santander.
The new facility amounted to 150m.
House price risk The cash flows arising from the Groups financial interest in property assets CHARM and the Tricomm Housing portfolio are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices.
However, consistent with the Groups approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties, the Group does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Groups business model.
Capital risk management The Board manages the Groups capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the Group to meet contractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing.
The current capital structure of the Group comprises a mix of debt and equity.
Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
The Board regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against key thresholds.
Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Boards view of markets, the prospects of, and risks relating to, the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The Group is now operating within a range of gearing of 45%50%, which it considers to be appropriate in the medium term.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.
Certain Group subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and therefore have externally applied capital adequacy requirements: however, these do not have any material impact on the Group as a whole.
