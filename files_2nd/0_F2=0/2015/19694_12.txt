The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by i the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and ii financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the presentation currency of the Group, and the functional currency of the Company and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
New accounting standards adopted during the year The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2014: IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11, Joint arrangements IFRS 12, Disclosure of interests in other entities Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on transitional guidance IAS 27, Separate financial statements revised 2011 IAS 28, Associates and joint ventures revised 2011 Amendment to IFRS10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, Investment entities Amendment to IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation, on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Amendment to IAS 36, Impairment of assets: Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting None of these have materially impacted the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the dates disclosed below and therefore after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards and Interpretations Effective for annual periods beginning on or after IFRS 9 Financial instruments: Hedge accounting 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: 1 January 2016 Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 28 1 January 2016 Investment Entities: Applying the consolidation exception Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations 1 January 2016 IFRS 14 Regulatory deferral accounts 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2017 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2013 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 1 resulting from disclosure initiative 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: 1 January 2016 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: 1 January 2016 Bearer Plants IAS 19 Defined benefit plans: employee contributions 1 July 2014 Amendment to IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial statements 1 January 2016 IFRIC 21 Levies 17 June 2014 Not yet adopted for use in the European Union.
With the exception of IFRS 15, the Directors have reviewed the requirements of the new standards and interpretations listed above and they are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
The impact of IFRS 15 is being assessed.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 63 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued.
Comparatives Where appropriate, comparative figures for the previous year have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation.
These changes have no impact on the consolidated income statement or on consolidated net assets.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures made up to 30 April in each year.
The consolidated income statement includes the results of businesses purchased from the effective date of acquisition and excludes the results of disposed operations and businesses sold from the effective date of disposal.
Non-controlling interests represents the portion of earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders of a subsidiary of the Group.
Subsidiaries and joint ventures i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method also known as the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries and other businesses.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Costs attributable to the acquisition are expensed to the consolidated income statement.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Joint ventures Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control with other investors.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.
When the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the joint ventures, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
The Groups reported interest in joint ventures includes goodwill on acquisition.
The Group applies its own accounting policies and estimates when accounting for its share of joint ventures making appropriate adjustments where necessary, having due regard to all relevant factors.
Presentation of income statement and exceptional items Where applicable, income statement information has been presented in a columnar format, which separately highlights intangible asset expenses and exceptional items.
This is intended to enable users of the financial statements to determine more readily the impact of intangible asset expenses and exceptional items on the results of the Group.
Exceptional items are defined in note 35.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period.
Although these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and assumptions used.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement of tax assets and liabilities, the measurement of contract provisions, the measurement of retirement benefit amounts, the measurement of liabilities for litigation, the measurement and impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets, the measurement of insurance provisions and the measurement of receivables and payables in relation to rail contracts.
The measurement of tax assets and liabilities requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax consequence of certain items that will only be resolved when agreed by the relevant tax authorities.
The measurement of contract provisions requires estimates of future cash flows relating to the relevant contracts and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The measurement of retirement benefit amounts requires the estimation of life expectancies, future changes in salaries, inflation and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The measurement of liabilities in respect of litigation involves estimating the financial effects of uncertain litigation.
The Group determines whether goodwill arising on business combinations is impaired on an annual basis and this requires the estimation of value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
This requires estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The estimation of the insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims have not been reported to the Group.
The estimation of receivables and payables in relation to rail contracts requires an estimate of the likely outcomes based on interpreting the applicable contracts.
Those accounting policies that the Directors believe require the greatest exercise of judgement are described in section 1.6.
13 of this Annual Report, which forms part of these financial statements.
Revenue Revenue represents gross revenue earned from public transport services and excludes payments received on account.
Amounts receivable from government bodies for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included as part of revenue as these represent payments for services provided.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and VAT.
Revenues incidental to the Groups principal activity including advertising income and maintenance income are reported as miscellaneous revenue.
Rail revenue includes amounts attributable to the train operating companies, based principally on agreed models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry in respect of passenger receipts.
Franchise agreement receipts or payments from or to the UKs Department for Transport are treated as operating costs or other operating income.
page 64 | Stagecoach Group plc 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 65 Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Revenue continued Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
Cash received for the sale of season tickets and travelcards is deferred within liabilities and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Income from advertising and other activities is recognised as the income is earned.
Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method as interest accrues.
Under the contractual terms of its franchise agreements to operate rail services, the Group has revenue sharing arrangements with the Department for Transport.
As a result of these arrangements, the Group may be liable to make payments to the Department for Transport or receive amounts from the Department for Transport.
The arrangements vary by franchise.
The amounts at South West Trains and East Midlands Trains are based on calculations that involve comparison of actual revenue with the target revenue specified in the relevant franchise agreement.
The amounts at West Coast Trains operated by the Groups Virgin Rail Group joint venture and Virgin Trains East Coast are based on calculations that involve comparing published UK national Gross Domestic Product GDP with the GDP comparator specified in the relevant franchise agreement.
The Group recognises revenue share amounts payable or receivable in the income statement in the same period in which it recognises the related revenue.
Revenue share amounts payable or receivable if any are treated as operating costs or other operating income.
The Groups regional UK Bus operations receive Bus Service Operators Grant BSOG which is essentially a rebate of fuel tax.
BSOG is recognised within operating costs as part of the net fuel costs of the Group.
Performance incentive payments Performance incentive payments received from or made to Network Rail by the Group in respect of rail operational performance are recognised in the same period that the performance relates to and are treated as operating costs or other operating income.
Government grants Grants from government are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are recorded as liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.
Amounts are held as deferred grant income within trade and other payables.
Revenue grants receivable and franchise premia amounts payable in respect of the operation of rail franchises in the UK are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the related revenue or expenditure is recognised in the income statement or where they do not relate to any specific revenue or expenditure, in the period in respect of which the amount is receivable or payable.
These premia payments and rail franchise grants are classified within operating costs and other operating income.
Share based payments The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Groups equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity-settled share based payments is determinable from the Companys quoted share price at the time of the award.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
The movement in this cumulative expense is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled by the Group or the holder, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
At each balance sheet date, the liability recognised is based on managements best estimate of the cash that will ultimately be payable taking into consideration the likelihood of non-market based vesting conditions being achieved.
Fair value for cash-settled share based payments relating to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the carrying amount of the liability are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cash-settled transactions see above.
Employment taxes Liabilities are recognised for employment taxes principally, employers national insurance liabilities payable by the Group on share based payments.
The liability for employment taxes is calculated at the balance sheet date with reference to the fair value of the related share based payments at that date.
In the case of cash-settled share based payments, the fair value is the pre-tax amount recorded in the balance sheet.
Movements in the liabilities for employment taxes on share based payments are charged or credited to the income statement.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated inclusive of restructuring costs and the share of after-tax results of joint ventures but before finance income, finance costs, non-operating exceptional items and taxation.
Stagecoach Group plc | page 65 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Taxation Tax, current and deferred, is calculated using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profit at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement as the related pre-tax item.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax is measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of operating segments, which for this purpose has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements of foreign operations are maintained in the functional currencies in which the entities transact business.
The trading results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into sterling using rates of exchange at the relevant balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign operations, together with exchange differences arising on net foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency derivatives, to the extent they hedge the Groups investment in foreign operations, are recognised as a separate component of equity being the translation reserve.
Further information on the Groups accounting policy on hedges of net investments in a foreign entity is provided on page 70.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group entities at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss.
On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the amount of any exchange differences relating to the subsidiary that has been deferred in the translation reserve is recognised in the income statement within the reported gain or loss on disposal.
The principal rates of exchange applied to the consolidated financial statements were: 2015 2014 US Dollar: Year end rate 1.5368 1.6886 Average rate 1.5988 1.6013 Canadian Dollar: Year end rate 1.8614 1.8531 Average rate 1.8323 1.6994 Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given for a business over the fair value of such net assets.
The fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill and acquired customer contract provisions on the acquisition of a business are amortised to the income statement in line with the projected cash flows.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prior to 1 May 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation ceased on 30 April 2004 but goodwill amortisation expensed prior to 1 May 2004 was not reversed.
Goodwill that arose prior to 1 May 2004 is measured at the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 April 1998 and earlier periods was written off directly to equity in accordance with the UK accounting standards then in force.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where goodwill other than that already written off directly to equity forms part of a cash generating unit and all or part of that unit is disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the disposed operation when determining the overall gain or loss on disposal.
page 66 | Stagecoach Group plc 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 67 Note 1 IFRS accounting policies continued Impairment of non-current assets Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets excluding goodwill and other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination are initially capitalised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost recognised is the aggregate amount paid plus the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition if i the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and ii its fair value can be measured reliably, and are subsequently measured at fair value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated to write-off the cost or fair value at acquisition as the case may be of each asset over their estimated useful lives shown below.
Amortisation of intangible assets relating to customer contracts and lease contracts is amortised based on the pattern of the consumption of economic benefits obtained from the relevant contract.
Amortisation on other intangible assets is calculated on the straight-line method.
Intangible assets relating to rail franchises of a finite duration are amortised over the expected life of the franchise.
Operating leases on favourable terms over the life of the lease up to 4 years for current contracts Customer contracts over the life of the contract 1 to 5 years for current contracts Right to operate rail franchises over the expected life of the franchise 10 years from February 2007 to February 2017 for South West Trains franchise, 7 years and 11 months from November 2007 to October 2015 for East Midland Trains franchise and 8 years and 1 month from March 2015 to March 2023 for Virgin Trains East Coast franchise Software costs 2 to 7 years Where the life of a contract or rail franchise is shortened or extended, the useful economic lives of any related intangible assets are reviewed, the intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and the remaining carrying value of each asset is amortised over its revised, remaining economic life.
New contracts and franchises are not treated as extensions of existing arrangements even when they cover the same business operations as expiring contracts and franchises.
Marketing costs incurred during the start-up phase of a new activity are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment acquired as part of a business combination is stated at fair value at the date of acquisition and is subsequently measured at fair value on acquisition less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to write off the cost, fair value at acquisition or deemed cost of each asset to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Heritable and freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties period of lease IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Passenger Service Vehicles PSVs and transportation equipment 7 to 16 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at least annually and, where applicable, adjustments are made on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal.
An item on which no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset is impaired if it is continued to be used by the Group.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group.
Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.

Hire purchase and lease obligations Assets acquired under hire purchase and finance lease arrangements, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Fixed lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs, and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance costs are charged directly against income and are reported within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
Assets capitalised under finance leases and other similar contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful economic lives.
Assets capitalised under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Rentals under operating leases are generally charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
However, contingent rentals, principally being rental adjustments related to inflation indices, are accounted for in the period they are incurred.
The principal restriction on assets held under finance lease or hire purchase agreements is a restriction on the right to dispose of the assets during the period of the agreement.
Tokens Tokens issued by the Group to facilitate public passenger travel in the United Kingdom are credited to a token redemption provision to the extent they are expected to be redeemed.
Redemptions are offset against this provision and associated handling commission paid to third parties is included in operating costs.
Funds from the sale of tokens and payments for the redemption of tokens are included as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
The estimate of the balance sheet provision for token redemptions is remeasured at each balance sheet date and is based on the value of tokens issued by the Group but not yet redeemed or cancelled at the balance sheet date.
Allowance is made for the estimated proportion of tokens in issue that will never be redeemed.
This allowance is estimated with reference to historic redemption rates.
Restructuring provisions Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of associated costs can be made.
Insurance The Group receives claims in respect of traffic incidents and employee claims.
The Group protects against the cost of such claims through third party insurance policies.
An element of the claims is not insured as a result of the excess or deductible on insurance policies.
Provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
The estimate of the balance sheet insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement of known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but for which claims have not yet been reported to the Group.
The provision is set after taking account of advice from third party actuaries.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group contributes to a number of pension schemes.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst scheme assets are recorded at market value.
In relation to each scheme, any recognised net asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the scheme or on settlement of the scheme liabilities.
The service costs of defined benefit schemes are spread systematically over the working lives of employees and included within operating profit.
Scheme administration expenses are also included within operating profit.
Net interest expense or income is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability and included within net finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the actual return on assets net of investment administration costs and taxes, such as amounts levied by the UK Pension Protection Fund and the discount rates applied to the assets.
Mortality rates are considered when retirement benefit obligations are calculated.
Past service costs and adjustments are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period the vesting period, in which case the past service costs are amortised using a straight-line method over the vesting period.
Curtailments arise where the Group makes a material reduction in the number of employees covered by a pension scheme or amends a defined benefit pension schemes terms such that a material element of future service by current employees will qualify for no or significantly reduced benefits.
Settlements arise when the Group enters into a transaction that eliminates all or part of the Groups obligations for benefits provided under a defined benefit pension scheme.
The gain or loss arising on a settlement or curtailment comprises the resulting change in the net pension asset or liability, and such gain or loss is recognised in the income statement when the settlement or curtailment occurs.
Where the gain or loss is related to a disposal of a business, it is included within the reported gain or loss on disposal.
A full actuarial valuation is undertaken triennially for each scheme and updated annually using independent actuaries following the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the scheme obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related obligations.
Experience adjustments and changes in assumptions which affect actuarial gains and losses are reflected in the actuarial gain or loss for the year.
The liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme represents only that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer expects to fund or recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
Where the award of a new rail franchise to the Group results in it assuming a net pension liability, a corresponding intangible asset is recognised, reflecting a cost in obtaining the right to operate the franchise.
When a pension asset is assumed, a corresponding deferred income balance is recognised.
The intangible asset or deferred income balance is amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the related franchise.

Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Financial instruments The disclosure of the accounting policies that follow for financial instruments are those that apply under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified, as appropriate, as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity investments or as available for sale.
They include cash and cash equivalents, accrued income, trade receivables, other receivables, other investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets designated as such on inception are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss where the assets meet the criteria for such classification.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term.
Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Assets in this category are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are discounted to the present value at the point they are first recognised and are subsequently amortised to the invoice amount by the payment due date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered in evaluating whether a trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within Other external charges.
When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Held-to-maturity investments: The Group holds no held-to-maturity investments.
Available for sale financial assets: Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the above categories.
These are included in non-current assets unless the Group intends to dispose of them within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
After initial recognition, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the asset is derecognised or until the asset is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss reported in equity is included in the income statement.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss - is removed from equity and is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
Financial liabilities When a financial liability is recognised initially, the Group measures it at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability.
Financial liabilities include trade payables, accruals, other payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement depends on its classification as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Financial liabilities classified as held for trading and derivative liabilities that are not designated as hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
Other: All other financial liabilities not classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair values The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to appropriate market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
These include using pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.

Net gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, are taken to the income statement.
These may arise from derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they are either not designated or not effective as hedging instruments from an accounting perspective.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Fair value hedges: For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged: the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both the derivative and the hedged item are taken to the income statement.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Cash flow hedges: For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
For cash flow hedges of forecast fuel purchases, the transfer is to operating costs within the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recorded in the statement of comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the income statement.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement immediately.
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: For hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in the statement of comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold.
Non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings, can be designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity and are subject to the same requirements as derivative hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity.
Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities at the balance sheet date of twelve months or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method subject to any adjustments in respect of fair value hedges.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
Interest on borrowings to purchase property, plant and equipment is expensed in the income statement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer or rollover settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are generally not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost which approximates to nominal value due to creditors days being relatively low.
Share capital and dividends Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company, its subsidiaries or employee share ownership trusts sponsored by the Company purchase ordinary shares in the Company, the consideration paid, including any attributable incremental external costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are recorded in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.

The Group is managed, and reports internally, on a basis consistent with its four continuing operating segments, being UK Bus regional operations, UK Bus London, North America and UK Rail.
The Groups IFRS accounting policies are applied consistently, where appropriate, to each segment.
The segmental information provided in this note is on the basis of the four operating segments as follows: Segment name Service operated Country of operation UK Bus regional operations Coach and bus operations United Kingdom and immaterial operations in mainland Europe UK Bus London Bus operations United Kingdom North America Coach and bus operations United States and Canada UK Rail Rail operations United Kingdom The Group has interests in four joint ventures: Virgin Rail Group and Anglia Rail that operate in UK Rail, Citylink that operates in UK Bus regional operations and Twin America LLC that operates in North America.
The results of these joint ventures are shown separately in notes 2 c and 2 g where material.
a Revenue Due to the nature of the Groups business, the origin and destination of revenue i. e. United Kingdom or North America is the same in all cases except in respect of an immaterial amount of revenue for services operated by UK Bus regional operations between the UK and mainland Europe.
As the Group sells bus and rail services to individuals, it has few customers that are individually major.
Its major customers are typically public bodies that subsidise or procure transport services such customers include local authorities, transport authorities and the UK Department for Transport.

Each cash generating unit is an operational division.
The UK Bus regional operations and UK Bus London cash generating units operate coach and bus operations in the United Kingdom.
The UK Bus regional operations Division also operates a small number of inter-city coach services in mainland Europe.
The North America cash generating unit operates coach and bus operations in the US and Canada.
No goodwill has been allocated to the Groups UK rail operations.
The cash generating units are as follows: UK Bus UK Bus North America regional operations London 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m m m Carrying amount of goodwill 47.5 47.5 3.6 3.6 81.8 74.3 Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Value in use Period covered by approved management plans used in value in use calculation 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections 9.0% 9.9% 9.0% 9.9% 11.8% 13.0% Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond period of management plan 2.3% 2.2% 2.3% 2.2% 4.4% 4.6% Difference between above growth rate and long-term average growth rate for market in which unit operates Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil The calculation of value in use for each cash generating unit shown above is most sensitive to the assumptions on discount rates and growth rates and in the case of UK Bus London, the number of new contracts won and the commercial terms of such contracts.
The assumptions used are considered to be consistent with past experience and external sources of information and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in section 1.4.
The cost base of the UK Bus regional operations and North American operations can be flexed in response to changes in revenue and there is scope to reduce capital expenditure in the medium-term if other cash flows deteriorate.
Risks to the cash flow forecasts remain, however, and are described in section 1.4.
The cost base of UK Bus London is less flexible because the business is contractually committed to operate the majority of its services.
The discount rates have been determined with reference to the estimated post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC of the Group.
The WACC has been estimated as at 30 April 2015 at 7.2% 2014: 7.9% based on: The market capitalisation and net debt of the Group as at 30 April 2015 as an indication of the split between debt and equity: A risk-free rate of 1.9% 2014: 2.7% : A levered beta for the Group of 0.8 2014: 0.9 : A marginal pre-tax cost of debt of 5.4% 2014: 5.2%.
The pre-tax discount rate for each CGU has been determined by adjusting the Groups WACC for the risk profile and effects of tax on each of the relevant CGUs.
The Directors believe that in the case of each of the cash generating units shown above, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the unit is based would not cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

Each joint venture is structured as a distinct legal entity and the Group accounts for its interests in all four joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.
There are no quoted market prices for any of the Groups investments in joint ventures.
a Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited The Group holds 49% of the equity and voting rights in Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited Virgin Rail Group.
The principal business of the group headed by Virgin Rail Group is the operation of inter-city train services under the West Coast rail franchise.
Virgin Rail Group is incorporated in the UK.
The Group considers that it has joint control of Virgin Rail Group even though it controls less than half of the voting rights in Virgin Rail Group.
That joint control results from contractual arrangements between the shareholders of Virgin Rail Group that require the agreement of both shareholders to decisions on key matters.
Virgin Rail Groups principal subsidiary is West Coast Trains Limited.
Under the terms of its rail franchise agreement, West Coast Trains Limited may only pay dividends and or repay loans from other related companies to the extent it remains compliant with certain financial ratios specified in the franchise agreement.
This could restrict West Coast Trains Limited from making distributions or repaying loans that would be otherwise permitted by company law.
West Coast Trains Limited is also prohibited from loaning money to related companies without the prior consent of the UK Department for Transport.
Such restrictions on distributions and loans generally apply to all entities operating train services under UK rail franchise agreements.
In addition, under arrangements pursuant to which a performance bond has been issued by an insurance company in connection with the West Coast rail franchise, Virgin Rail Group is required to maintain consolidated net assets under UK GAAP and applying its own accounting policies of no less than 22.5m 2014: 22.5m.
This could restrict Virgin Rail Groups ability to make distributions to the Stagecoach Group.
Subject to the shareholders consideration of how much cash to retain in the business for working capital requirements and subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet any obligations under rail franchise agreements, the distributable profits of Virgin Rail Group are to be distributed in full to its shareholders.
Both shareholders in Virgin Rail Group would need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
b Twin America LLC The Group holds 60% of the economic interests and 50% of the voting rights in Twin America LLC Twin America.
The principal business of the group headed by Twin America is the operation of sightseeing coach tours in and around the city of New York in the United States.
Twin America is incorporated in the United States.
Contractual arrangements are in place in respect of Twin America which require the agreement of both members to decisions on key matters.
In light of that and despite the fact that the Chief Executive of Twin America is a representative of the other member, the Group considers that it has joint control of Twin America.
In connection with the settlement of litigation in respect of Twin America see note 31 iv, the Group has contractually committed to make loans of up to US$15.0m to Twin America.
As at 30 April 2015, the outstanding amount of loans made by the Group to Twin America was US$9.0m.
The Group currently expects that the maximum loan that will be required in connection with the settlement of the litigation will be US$9.0m.
The Group has also contractually committed to pay non-refundable amounts of US$6.0m directly to the plaintiffs in connection with the settlement of the litigation, of which US$4.0m had been paid prior to 30 April 2015 and the remaining US$2.0m is expected to be paid during the year ending 30 April 2016.
The contractual arrangements between the members of Twin America permit dividends of US$6.0m per annum to be paid by Twin America prior to the repayment of any loans outstanding to the Group.
No dividends in excess of US$6.0m per annum may be paid for as long as there remain outstanding loans from the Group.
Subject to that and other than where both members agree otherwise, the available cash flow of Twin America is distributed to its members quarterly after retaining sufficient cash for the anticipated working capital needs of the business.
c Scottish Citylink Coaches Limited The Group holds 35% of the equity and voting rights in Scottish Citylink Coaches Limited Citylink.
The principal business of Citylink is the operation of inter-city coach services to, from and within Scotland.
It is incorporated in the UK.
The Group considers that it has joint control of Citylink even although it controls less than half of the voting rights in Citylink but is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business.
That joint control results from contractual arrangements between the shareholders of Citylink that require the agreement of both shareholders to decisions on key matters.
The profit after tax of Citylink is distributed in full to its shareholders subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet the liquidity requirements of the business and subject to there being no outstanding amounts payable by Citylink in respect of loans from its shareholders and accrued interest on such loans.
Both shareholders in Citylink need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
d Anglia Rail Holdings Limited The Group acquired 40% of the equity and voting rights in Anglia Rail Holdings Limited Anglia Rail during the year ended 30 April 2015.
The group headed by Anglia Rail is one of three bidders shortlisted to bid for the new East Anglia rail franchise.
It is a joint venture between the Group and Abellio.
Anglia Rail is incorporated in the UK.
The Group considers that it has joint control of Anglia Rail even though it controls less than half of the voting rights in Anglia Rail.
That joint control results from contractual arrangements between the shareholders of Anglia Rail that require the agreement of both shareholders to decisions on key matters.
Under the contractual arrangements pertaining to the joint venture, the Group is contractually committed to funding up to 2.4m of costs in connection with the bid for the new East Anglia rail franchise.
The distributable profits of Anglia Rail are to be distributed in full to its shareholders subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet any obligations under rail franchise agreements.
Both shareholders in Anglia Rail need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.

Other than in respect of Twin America, there is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed the recoverable amounts.
Trading at Twin America has remained challenging during the year ended 30 April 2015, as the New York sightseeing market continues to be competitive.
In addition, the joint venture is relinquishing rights to use certain bus stops as explained in section 1.5.
Headroom exists between the 35.9m carrying value of the investment and its value in use.
As at 30 April 2015, the headroom in the base case is 9.3m.
This headroom would be eliminated with the investment at breakeven if the assumed revenue growth rate was lower by 70 basis points in each year of the 5-year forecast period, or if the discount rate were to increase by a further 160 basis points.
f Movements in carrying values The movements in the carrying values were as follows: Virgin Rail Twin Total Total Group Citylink America LLC 2015 2014 m m m m m Cost At beginning of year 67.7 4.1 28.5 100.3 110.8 Share of recognised profit 22.3 1.1 4.7 28.1 0.4 Share of actuarial gains on defined benefit pension schemes, net of tax 0.1 0.1 Share of other comprehensive expense on cash flow hedges, net of tax 1.8 1.8 Share of foreign exchange differences on translation of foreign operations 0.2 0.2 Dividends received in cash 13.7 0.4 0.4 14.5 8.2 Foreign exchange movements 3.3 3.3 2.7 At end of year 74.6 4.8 35.9 115.3 100.3 Amounts written off At beginning and end of year 57.5 57.5 57.5 Net book value at beginning of year 10.2 4.1 28.5 42.8 53.3 Net book value at end of year 17.1 4.8 35.9 57.8 42.8 A loan payable to Citylink of 1.7m 2014: 1.7m is reflected in note 21.
A loan receivable from Twin America of 5.9m 2014: Nil is reflected in note 19. g Summarised financial information of joint ventures The summarised financial information shown below is in accordance with IFRS and the Groups accounting policies.
Where a joint ventures own accounts are prepared other than in accordance with IFRS and the Groups accounting policies, appropriate adjustments have been made to determine the figures shown below.
Adjustments have also been made, as appropriate, to reflect fair value adjustments made at the time of acquisition.
Except where stated, the amounts shown are in respect of 100% of each joint venture and not just the Groups share of the joint venture.
Each of the Groups joint ventures has a statutory financial year-end that differs from that of the Groups, which is 30 April.
In applying the equity method of accounting to its interests in joint ventures, the Group refers to the edition of each joint ventures management accounts that has a balance sheet date closest to the Groups balance sheet date.
In some cases, the balance sheet date differs from the Groups by a few days but the impact of that on the Groups consolidated financial statements is not material.

The Group considers that principal subsidiaries includes any subsidiary that has revenue greater than 25.0m per annum, profit before interest and taxation greater than 2.5m per annum, gross assets greater than 25.0m or gross liabilities greater than 25.0m.
These thresholds exclude any intercompany amounts and investments in subsidiaries.
A complete list of subsidiary undertakings is available on request to the Company and will be filed with the next Annual Return.
Stagecoach Group plc has given a guarantee under section 479C of the Companies Act 2006 the Act in respect of the year ended 30 April 2015 of the following of its subsidiary companies and the following subsidiary company is exempt from the requirements of the Act relating to the audit of individual accounts by virtue of Section 479A of the Companies Act 2006: Magicbus Limited page 86 | Stagecoach Group plc 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 87 Note 17 Principal subsidiaries continued Asset purchase and non-controlling interests The UK Department for Transport awarded the Virgin Trains East Coast rail franchise to the Group during the year ended 30 April 2015.
In connection with that award, a subsidiary company, Inter City Railways Limited, purchased all of the equity in East Coast Main Line Company Limited, the train operating company that now operates inter-city train services in the UK under the Virgin Trains East Coast rail franchise.
East Coast Main Line Company Limited held certain assets and liabilities at the date of purchase.
However, it did not constitute a business and so the purchase was accounted for by the Group as an asset purchase rather than as a business combination.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Group based on their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net liabilities assumed was recognised as an intangible asset, being the cost of the right to operate the franchise.
Inter City Railways Limited is the one subsidiary in which a third party has a material non-controlling interest.
The Group holds 90% of the equity and voting rights in Inter City Railways Limited.
Both Inter City Railways Limited and East Coast Main Line Company Limited are incorporated in the UK.
The Virgin Group of companies holds the other 10% of the equity and voting rights of Inter City Railways Limited and also receives a royalty fee from East Coast Main Line Company Limited that varies depending on the revenue and profit of that company.
The Group has contractual arrangements with the Virgin Group in respect of the business.
However, the Group may appoint a majority of the directors of Inter City Railways Limited and appoint the executive management of East Coast Main Line Company Limited.
Also, the Group is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, the Managing Director of the business reports directly to the Group Chief Executive and so the Group has the power to direct the activities of the entity.
The Group therefore accounts for Inter City Railways Limited and East Coast Main Line Company Limited as subsidiaries.
The profit for the year ended 30 April 2015 allocated to the non-controlling interest is shown on the consolidated income statement.
The accumulated non-controlling interest as at 30 April 2015 is shown on the consolidated balance sheet and the movement in that interest in the year including any dividends paid to non-controlling interests is shown in the consolidated statement of movements in equity.
At least 75% of the distributable profit of Inter City Railways Limited should be distributed to its shareholders within four months of each financial yearend subject to retaining sufficient cash to meet any obligations under rail franchise agreements.
Both shareholders in Inter City Railways Limited need to agree to any changes to or deviations from that dividend policy.
Under the terms of its rail franchise agreement, East Coast Main Line Company Limited may only pay dividends and or repay loans from other Group companies to the extent it remains compliant with certain financial ratios specified in the franchise agreement.
This could restrict it from making distributions or repaying loans that would be otherwise permitted by company law.
East Coast Main Line Company Limited is also prohibited from loaning money to other Group companies without the prior consent of the UK Department for Transport.
Such restrictions on dividends and loans generally apply to all entities operating train services under UK rail franchise agreements, including two of Stagecoach Groups other subsidiaries, Stagecoach South Western Trains Limited and East Midlands Trains Limited.
The Group may be required to loan amounts to East Coast Main Line Company Limited pursuant to the committed loan facilities shown in note 31 iii.

Stagecoach Group plc | page 91 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 92 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 25 Retirement benefits a Description of retirement benefit arrangements United Kingdom funded schemes The Group participates in a number of funded defined benefit schemes in the UK as follows.
Date as at which last scheme valuation was prepared Stagecoach Pension Schemes SPS comprising: The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme: and 30 April 2011 The East London and Selkent Pension Scheme: 5 April 2013 The South West Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : 31 December 2013 The Island Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : 31 December 2013 The East Midlands Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : 31 December 2013 The East Coast Main Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS : and 31 December 2013 A number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS.
31 March 2013 The Stagecoach Pension Schemes and the Local Government Pension Schemes are closed to new members from the Group.
All relevant sections of the Railways Pension Schemes are open to new members.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes covering UK employees, for which the Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid other than lump-sum death in service benefits that are provided for certain UK employees.
For the defined benefit schemes, benefits are related to length of service and pensionable salary.
Pensionable salary for the Stagecoach Pension Schemes is subject to capped increases.
The weighted average duration as at 30 April 2015 of the expected benefit payments across all UK defined benefit schemes is estimated at 20.0 years 2014: 19.5 years.
The Directors believe that separate consideration should be given to RPS as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of the relevant sections of the scheme following expiry of the related franchises.
In addition, under the terms of RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40% in accordance with the shared cost nature of RPS.
The employees share of the deficit or surplus is reflected as an adjustment to RPS liabilities or assets.
Therefore the liability or asset recognised for the relevant sections of RPS reflects only that part of the net deficit or surplus of each section that the employer is expected to fund or expected to recover over the life of the franchise to which the section relates.
The adjusting entry referred to as the franchise adjustment represents that proportion of the deficit or surplus that is expected to exist at the end of the franchise and which the Group would not be obliged to fund or entitled to recover.
The Group is a participating employer in a number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes, and has limited influence over the operations of these schemes.
Active membership of these schemes is small and represents 2.3% 2014: 2.4% of the pensions charge in the consolidated income statement, but historic liabilities mean that these schemes represent around 8.9% 2014: 11.5% of the gross present value of pension obligations as at 30 April 2015 shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The Group liaises with the administering authorities to seek to set contributions at appropriate levels to fund the benefits and deficit recovery payments over a reasonable period of time.
North America funded schemes The Group participates in two small funded defined benefit schemes in North America, both of which are closed to new members.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes which are open to eligible North American employees, for which the Group has no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid.
Unfunded schemes The Group makes contributions to an unapproved employer-financed retirement benefit scheme EFRBS in the UK and a non qualifying defined contribution scheme NQDC in the US.
In each case, the liabilities of these schemes are unfunded but the Group has set aside assets to meet its obligations under the schemes.
In the case of the EFRBS, the scheme holds a guarantee over the assets which the Group has set aside.
The Group considers that the assets set aside are in substance pensions assets and so the amounts of those assets are included within the net pension amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet.
The carrying value of those assets as at 30 April 2015 was 5.2m 2014: 3.9m.
Other unfunded benefits are provided to a small number of former employees with the net liabilities included within the unfunded balance reported in the tables that follow.

b Principal actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the pensions amounts as at 30 April 2015 and 30 April 2014 are shown below: 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.7% 4.5% Retail Prices inflation assumption 3.2% 3.3% Consumer Prices inflation assumption 1.9% 2.3% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries SPS 2.0% 2.0% Others 3.2% 3.8% Rate of increase of pensions in payment SPS 3.1% 3.2% Others 1.9% 2.3% Post-retirement mortality life expectancies in years Current pensioners at 65 male 19.3 19.2 Current pensioners at 65 female 23.6 23.5 Future pensioners at 65 aged 45 now male 21.4 21.3 Future pensioners at 65 aged 45 now female 25.5 25.3 The assumptions shown above are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not be borne out in practice.
The discount rate assumption is not determined using a cash-weighted method and is based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the year end, adjusted to reflect the duration of the schemes liabilities.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the Group and its sector and allow for expected increases in longevity.
c Pension amounts recognised in the balance sheet The consolidated balance sheet shows retirement benefit assets of 25.5m 2014: 7.8m and retirement benefit obligations of 186.0m 2014: 123.6m, resulting in the net liability of 160.5m 2014: 115.8m analysed below.

This fund is a multi-asset fund, tactically adjusted by the RPS Investment team.
d Funding arrangements and schemes The schemes investment approach, which aims to meet their liabilities as they fall due, is to invest the majority of the schemes assets in a mix of equities and other return-seeking assets in order to strike a balance between: maximising the returns on the schemes assets, and minimising the risks associated with lower than expected returns on the schemes assets.
Trustees are required to regularly review investment strategy in light of the term and nature of the schemes liabilities.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees of the Stagecoach Pension Schemes and the Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the contributions necessary to fund the benefits, including any deficit recovery amounts, over a reasonable period of time.
A Pensions Oversight Committee has been established comprising the Finance Director, a Non-Executive Director and other senior executives, to oversee the Groups overall pensions strategy.
The Board participates in major decisions on the funding and design of pension schemes.
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make additional contributions to fund deficits.
The defined benefit pension schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial funding risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, and longevity life expectancy risk.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The actuarial valuation for the East London and Selkent Pension Scheme was completed during the year, and showed that as at 5 April 2013, the scheme was 100% funded on the Trustees technical provisions basis.
Actuarial valuations were completed for the Local Government Pension Schemes, showing that the schemes were underfunded on the technical provisions basis as at 31 March 2013 with deficit contributions payable.
The actuarial valuations for the Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme as at 30 April 2014 is currently being finalised.
The Group forecasts to contribute 73.4m forecast at 30 April 2014 for year ended 30 April 2015: 59.1m to its defined benefit schemes in the financial year ending 30 April 2016. e Changes in net retirement benefit obligations The change in net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes is comprised as follows: Year ended 30 April 2015 Funded schemes SPS RPS LGPS Other Unfunded Total schemes m m m m m m At beginning of year liability asset 92.6 6.3 23.6 2.0 3.9 115.8 Rail franchise changes 24.5 24.5 Expense charged to consolidated income statement 24.1 38.1 1.9 0.9 0.2 65.2 Recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 74.3 3.2 12.4 0.2 0.2 65.5 Employers contributions 19.3 34.9 6.5 0.5 0.3 61.5 At end of year liability asset 171.7 24.4 6.6 2.6 4.0 160.5 Year ended 30 April 2014 Funded schemes SPS RPS LGPS Other Unfunded Total schemes m m m m m m At beginning of year liability asset 106.0 9.8 7.6 1.6 4.2 109.6 Expense charged to consolidated income statement 26.2 33.7 1.8 0.6 0.2 62.5 Recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 19.5 0.5 18.9 0.3 0.2 Employers contributions 20.1 30.7 4.7 0.5 0.3 56.3 At end of year liability asset 92.6 6.3 23.6 2.0 3.9 115.8 page 94 | Stagecoach Group plc 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:30 Page 95 Note 25 Retirement benefits continued f Sensitivity of retirement benefit obligations to changes in assumptions The measurement of the defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions as described below: The discount rate has been selected following actuarial advice and taking into account the duration of the liabilities.
A 10 basis points increase in the discount rate would result in a 20.3m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 20.0m.
A 10 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in a 20.6m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 20.4m.
The inflation assumption adopted is consistent with the discount rate used.
It is used to set the assumptions for pension increases, uncapped pensionable salary increases and deferred revaluations.
A 10 basis points increase in the inflation rate would result in a 11.4m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 12.7m.
A 10 basis points decrease in the inflation rate would result in a 11.4m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 14.0m.
A 10 basis point increase in the rate of increase in uncapped pensionable salaries would result in a 1.2m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 0.6m.
A 10 basis point decrease in the rate of increase in uncapped pensionable salaries would result in a 1.3m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 0.6m.
A 10 basis point increase in the rate of increase of pensions in payment would result in a 7.1m increase in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 11.6m.
A 10 basis point decrease in the rate of increase of pensions in payment would result in a 7.1m decrease in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 10.7m.
The longevity assumptions adopted are a best estimate of the mortality of scheme members both during and after employment, and are based on the most recent mortality data available from actuarial valuations.
If life expectancy of the relevant individuals was to increase by one year, this would result in an increase of 36.2m in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 41.6m.
If life expectancy of the relevant individuals was to decrease by one year, this would result in a decrease of 36.2m in the net pension liabilities as at 30 April 2015 2014: 43.8m.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net liability in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested assets held by the schemes.

Retirement benefit assets and obligations.
Financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share based payment transactions.
Liabilities or assets that are not contractual such as income taxes that are created as a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments, prepayments, provisions and deferred income are not financial liabilities or financial assets.
Accordingly, prepayments, provisions, deferred income and amounts payable or receivable in respect of corporation tax, sales tax including UK Value Added Tax, payroll tax and other taxes are excluded from the disclosures provided in this note.

Information on the carrying value of such derivatives is provided in note 26 g. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities shown above are determined as follows: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accrued income, trade receivables, loans to joint ventures and other receivables is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The effect of credit losses not already reflected in the carrying value as impairment losses is assumed to be immaterial.
The carrying value of trade payables, other payables, accruals and loans from joint ventures is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Given the relatively short average time to maturity, no specific assumptions on discount rates have been made.
The fair value of fixed-rate notes included in borrowings that are quoted on a recognised stock exchange is determined with reference to the bid price as at the balance sheet date.
page 98 | Stagecoach Group plc 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:31 Page 99 Note 26 Financial instruments continued b Carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities continued Financial liabilities continued The carrying value of fixed-rate notes that are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange and fixed-rate hire purchase and finance lease liabilities included in borrowings is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value taking account of the amounts involved in the context of total financial liabilities and the fixed interest rates relative to market interest rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of other borrowings on which interest is payable at floating rates is not considered to be materially different from the carrying value.
We do not consider that the fair value of financial instruments would change materially from that shown above as a result of any reasonable change to the assumptions made in determining the fair values shown above.
The fair value of financial instruments, and in particular the fixed rate notes, would be affected by changes in market interest rates.
Excluding the element hedged in a fair value hedge, we estimate that a 100 basis points reduction in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed-rate notes liability by around 12.1m 2014: 15.8m.
Fair value estimation Financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value are disclosed by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 0 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 2 Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the hierarchy at 30 April 2015.
Note Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 26 g 3.4 3.4 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 26 g 41.3 41.3 The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the hierarchy at 30 April 2014.

The value of the assets is not material to the Group and therefore changes in valuations would not have a material effect on the financial statements.
c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments The Groups use of financial instruments exposes it to a variety of financial risks, principally: Market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk: Credit risk: and Liquidity risk.
This note c presents qualitative information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, including the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk: there have been no significant changes to these matters during the year ended 30 April 2015.
This note c also provides summary quantitative data about the Groups exposure to each risk.
In addition, information on the Groups management of capital is provided in section 1.6.
11 of the Strategic report which forms part of these financial statements.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the likelihood and or magnitude of adverse effects on the financial performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
A Group Treasury Committee and central treasury department Group Treasury oversee financial risk management in the context of policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury is responsible for the execution of derivative financial instruments to manage financial risks.
Certain financial risk management activities for example, the management of credit risk arising from trade and other receivables are devolved to the management of individual business units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
i Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and commodity prices will affect the Groups financial performance and or financial position.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to reduce volatility in the consolidated income statement.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk principally as a result of net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group has material foreign investments in Canada and the USA.
To reduce balance sheet translation exposure, the Group partially hedges the sterling carrying value of foreign operations through borrowings denominated in their functional currency or, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Gains and losses arising from hedging instruments that provide a hedge against foreign net investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Bank loans drawn in US Dollars and a US$150.0m bond issued in October 2012 have been accounted for as a hedge of the Groups foreign net investments.
The Groups objective in managing and measuring foreign currency translation risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies is to maintain an appropriate cost of borrowing and retain some potential for benefiting from currency movements whilst partially hedging against adverse currency movements.
It is the Groups policy to examine each foreign investment individually and to adopt an appropriate hedging strategy.
The Group measures foreign currency translation risk by identifying the carrying value of assets and liabilities denominated in the relevant foreign currency and quantifying the impact on equity of changes in the relevant foreign currency rate.
The Groups consolidated income statement is principally exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates in the following ways: The translation of the revenues and costs of the Groups North American operations: and The translation of interest payable on US dollar denominated debt.
The Groups consolidated balance sheet exposures to foreign currency translation risk excluding immaterial exposure to Euros were as follows: 2015 2014 m m US dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 249.4 230.7 Cash 33.8 24.5 Borrowings 183.3 174.0 Canadian dollars Net investments in foreign operations excluding intra-group balances, cash and borrowings 29.8 37.0 Cash 1.0 0.7 Net exposure 130.7 118.9 The amounts shown above are the carrying values of all items in the consolidated balance sheet that would have differed at the balance sheet date had a different foreign currency exchange rate been applied, except that derivatives that are cash flow hedges are excluded.
The sensitivity of the amounts shown above in the Groups consolidated balance sheet to translation exposures is illustrated below: 2015 2014 US dollar US dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.5368 1.6886 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.3831 1.5197 Increase in consolidated equity m 11.1 9.0 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against US dollar US dollar foreign exchange rate 1.6905 1.8575 Decrease in consolidated equity m 9.1 7.4 Canadian dollar Canadian dollar balance sheet foreign exchange rate 1.8614 1.8531 Impact of 10% depreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 1.6753 1.6678 Increase in consolidated equity m 3.4 4.2 Impact of 10% appreciation of UK sterling against Canadian dollar Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate 2.0475 2.0384 Decrease in consolidated equity m 2.8 3.4 The above sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Only those foreign currency assets and liabilities that are directly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates are included in the calculation.
The above calculations assume that the exchange rates between sterling and any currencies other than the one stated do not change as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the currencies stated.

For example, changes in the sterling value of commodity prices that indirectly occur due to changes in foreign exchange rates are not included in the sensitivity calculation.

The Group is exposed to limited foreign currency transactional risk due to the low value of transactions entered into by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency.
Group Treasury carries out forward buying of currencies where appropriate.
The Group reviews and considers hedging of actual and forecast foreign exchange transactional exposures up to one year forward.
At 30 April 2015 there were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures 2014: Nil.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk includes a foreign currency element due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the sterling cost of fuel for the Groups UK operations.
The effect of foreign exchange rate movements on sterling-denominated fuel prices is managed through the use of fuel derivative financial instruments denominated in the functional currency in which the fuel is purchased.
Further information on fuel hedging is given under the heading Price risk on page 103.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally through its borrowings and interest rate derivatives.
It has a mixture of fixed-rate borrowings where the fair value is exposed to changes in market interest rates, cash and floating-rate borrowings where the future cash flows are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
The Groups objective with regards to interest rate risk is to reduce the risk of changes in interest rates significantly affecting future cash flows and or profit.
To provide some certainty as to the level of interest cost, it is the Groups policy to manage interest rate exposure through the use of fixed and floating rate debt.
Derivative financial instruments are also used where appropriate to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group measures interest rate risk by quantifying the relative proportions of each of gross debt and net debt that are effectively subject to fixed interest rates and considers the duration for which the relevant interest rates are fixed.
At 30 April 2015, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Currency Floating rate Fixed rate Total Weighted Weighted average fixed average period interest rate for which rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 189.9 412.1 602.0 5.8% 1.6 US Dollar 149.3 34.0 183.3 2.3% 2.2 Gross borrowings 339.2 446.1 785.3 5.5% 1.7 At 30 April 2014, the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities was as follows: Currency Floating rate Fixed rate Total Weighted Weighted average fixed average period interest rate for which rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling 122.8 414.3 537.1 5.8% 2.6 US Dollar 135.8 38.2 174.0 2.6% 2.6 Gross borrowings 258.6 452.5 711.1 5.5% 2.6 The above figures take into account the effect of US$150m of interest rate derivatives which swap the US$150m Notes maturing October 2022 from fixed to floating rate debt for a period of four years to December 2016.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one to six months based on market rates.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in note 22 a.
The Groups financial assets on which floating interest is receivable include cash deposits and cash in hand of 395.6m 2014: 240.3m.
Loans to joint ventures of 5.9m 2014: Nil bear interest at a fixed rate of 6% 2014: not applicable per annum.
As at 30 April 2015, the Group had no other financial assets on which fixed interest is receivable 2014: Nil.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Groups operations as at 30 April 2015 consume approximately 406.0m litres of diesel fuel per annum.
As a result, the Groups profit is exposed to movements in the underlying price of fuel.
The Groups objective in managing commodity price risk is to reduce the risk that movements in fuel prices result in adverse movements in its profit and cash flow.
The Group has a policy of managing the volatility in its fuel costs by maintaining an ongoing fuel-hedging programme whereby derivatives are used to fix or cap the variable unit cost of a percentage of anticipated fuel consumption.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk is measured by quantifying the element of projected future fuel costs, after taking account of derivatives in place, which varies due to movements in fuel prices.
Group Treasury is responsible for the processes for measuring and managing commodity price risk.
The Groups overall fuel costs include the impact of delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates.
These elements of fuel costs are not managed as part of Group Treasurys commodity price risk management and are managed directly by business unit management.
The Group uses a number of fuel derivatives to hedge against movements in the price of the different types of fuel used in each of its divisions.
The fuel derivatives hedge the underlying commodity price risk denominated in US$ and in the case of the UK Bus regional operations Division, the UK Bus London Division and the UK Rail Division, they also hedge the currency risk due to the commodity being priced in US$ and the functional currency of the divisions being pounds sterling.
At 30 April 2015 and 30 April 2014, the projected fuel costs excluding premia payable on fuel derivatives, delivery margins, fuel taxes and fuel tax rebates for the next twelve months were: 2015 2014 m m Costs subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 81.7 90.7 UK Bus London 8.4 9.5 UK Rail 25.1 24.6 North America 33.2 34.8 148.4 159.6 Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 4.7 5.5 UK Bus London 6.1 8.9 UK Rail 1.4 9.0 North America 6.0 8.2 18.2 31.6 Total 166.6 191.2 The figures in the above table are after taking account of derivatives and applying the fuel prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% higher at the balance sheet date, the amounts in the above table would change by the following: 2015 2014 m m Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.5 0.6 UK Bus London 0.6 0.9 UK Rail 0.1 0.9 North America 0.6 0.8 Decrease in projected profit before taxation 1.8 3.2 Stagecoach Group plc | page 103 117804 STC Back PRINT 117804 STC Back V12 01 07 2015 14:31 Page 104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 26 Financial instruments continued c Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued i Market risk continued If all of the relevant fuel prices were 10% lower at the balance sheet date, the amounts would change by the following: 2015 2014 m m Costs not subject to fuel swaps: UK Bus regional operations 0.5 0.6 UK Bus London 0.6 0.9 UK Rail 0.1 0.9 North America 0.6 0.8 Increase in projected profit before taxation 1.8 3.2 The revenue receivable under certain of the contracts that the Group has with customers is subject to adjustment for changes to certain fuel prices.
This further reduces the unhedged exposure to fuel prices shown above.
Demand for the Groups services can also be affected by movements in fuel prices due to the impact on the cost of competing transport services, including private cars.
The Group is also exposed to changes in electricity prices, principally in its UK Rail Division where electricity is consumed to power some of the trains operated.
The Group has some protection to price changes via rail industry arrangements to fix the price on a proportion of anticipated future electricity consumption.
The Groups joint venture, Virgin Rail Group, is also exposed to changes in fuel and electricity prices and applies commodity price risk management strategies similar to those applied by the Group and explained above.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk is managed by a combination of Group Treasury and business unit management, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to amounts due from outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk to an acceptable level whilst not overly restricting the Groups ability to generate revenue and profit.
It is the Groups policy to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
To control credit risk, counterparty credit limits are set by reference to published credit ratings and the counterpartys geographical location.
The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be low.
In determining whether a financial asset is impaired, the Group takes account of: The fair value of the asset at the balance sheet date and where applicable, the historic fair value of the asset: In the case of receivables, the counterpartys typical payment patterns: In the case of receivables, the latest available information on the counterpartys creditworthiness such as available financial statements, credit ratings etc.
The movement in the provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is shown in note 19.
The table below shows the financial assets exposed to credit risk at the balance sheet date: Gross Impairment Net exposure Gross Impairment Net exposure 2015 2015 2015 2014 2014 2014 m m m m m m Trade receivables 204.7 2.8 201.9 132.6 2.1 130.5 Loans, other receivables and accrued income 79.0 79.0 82.9 82.9 Cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral 18.8 18.8 18.9 18.9 Cash and cash equivalents other 376.8 376.8 221.4 221.4 Excluding derivative financial instruments 679.3 2.8 676.5 455.8 2.1 453.7 Derivatives used for hedging 3.4 3.4 0.6 0.6 Total exposure to credit risk 682.7 2.8 679.9 456.4 2.1 454.3 The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer or counterparty.
The Groups largest credit exposures are to the UKs Department for Transport, Transport for London, and other government bodies and financial institutions with short-term credit ratings of A2 or equivalent or better, all of which the Group considers unlikely to default on their respective liabilities to the Group.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups objective in managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The funding policy is to finance the Group through a mixture of bank, lease and hire purchase debt, capital markets issues and cash generated by the business.
As at 30 April 2015, the Groups credit facilities were 1,141.1m 2014: 1,051.4m, 673.7m 2014: 483.5m of which were utilised, including utilisation for the issuance of bank guarantees, performance season ticket bonds and letters of credit.
The Group had the following undrawn committed banking and uncommitted asset finance facilities: 2015 2014 m m Expiring within one year 168.1 202.6 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 355.8 Expiring beyond two years 299.3 9.5 467.4 567.9 Although there is an element of seasonality in the Groups bus and rail operations, the overall impact of seasonality on working capital and liquidity is not considered significant.
The Board expects the Group to be able to meet current and future funding requirements through free cash flow and available committed facilities.
In addition, the Group has investment grade credit ratings which should allow it access at short notice to additional bank and capital markets debt funding.
The Group has bank lines of credit arranged on a bi-lateral basis with a group of relationship banks which provide bank facilities for general corporate purposes.
These arranged lines of credit allow cash drawdowns to finance the Group and also include facilities which are dedicated to issuing performance season ticket bonds, guarantees and letters of credit.

Where the contractual cash flows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index in the future, the contractual cash flows in the above table have been determined with reference to the value of the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cash flows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cash flows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the above tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
In the case of bank loans, which are drawn under revolving facilities, the contracted interest cash flows in respect of interest up to and including the next rollover date are shown and the principal is shown as repayable at the expiry date of the relevant facility.

of shares m Allotted, called-up and fully-paid ordinary shares of 125 228 pence each At beginning and end of year 576,099,960 3.2 576,099,960 3.2 The balance on the share capital account shown above represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary shares in issue.
This figure includes 1,371,639 2014: 724,693 ordinary shares held in treasury, which are treated as a deduction from equity in the Groups financial statements.
The shares held in treasury do not qualify for dividends.
The Group operates two Employee Share Ownership Trusts: the Stagecoach Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST and the Stagecoach Group Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
Shares held by these trusts are treated as a deduction from equity in the Groups financial statements.
Other assets and liabilities of the trusts are consolidated in the Groups financial statements as if they were assets and liabilities of the Group.
As at 30 April 2015, the QUEST held 300,634 2014: 300,634 ordinary shares in the Company and the EBT held 891,396 2014: 725,821 ordinary shares in the Company.
The trusts have waived dividends on the shares they hold and therefore received no dividends during the year ended 30 April 2015 2014: Nil.
The trust deed for the EBT obliges the trustee to waive the right to any dividend on the shares unless and until they are vested in an individual.
The trustee is confirmed not to be liable for any lost income as a result of that waiver.
The QUEST deed requires the trustee to waive any dividends payable on the shares and the QUEST confirms that waiver within the deed.
This can be reversed by a direction from the Company to the trustee but is otherwise ongoing.
Note 28 Share based payments The Group operates a Buy as You Earn Scheme BAYE, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and an Executive Participation Plan EPP.
The Directors remuneration report in section 8 of this Annual Report gives further details of each of these arrangements.
As disclosed in note 6, share based payment charges of 4.8m 2014: 6.6m have been recognised in the income statement during the year in relation to the above schemes.

LTIP awards are based on Incentive Units.
One Incentive Unit has a value equal to one of the Companys ordinary shares but subject to performance conditions.
LTIP awards are not share options and are valued using a separate simulation model and disclosures in respect of exercise prices, expected volatility and risk free rates are not applicable.
Expectations of meeting market-based performance criteria are reflected in the fair value of the LTIP awards.

TSR ranking is based on the Groups ranking of total shareholder return in the FTSE 250 whereby 1 is top of the comparator group.
The TSR ranking is calculated by independent advisors.
Executive Participation Plan Under the EPP, executives and senior managers sacrifice part of their actual annual cash bonus and are awarded Deferred Shares with an initial market value approximately equal to the amount of bonus foregone.

The Company provides two matching shares for every share bought from the first 10 of each employees monthly investment, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 per employee per month.
If the shares are held in trust for five years or more, no Income Tax and National Insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 30 April 2015 there were 8,732 2014: 8,617 participants in the BAYE scheme to which were attributed 4,438,746 2014: 3,200,457 shares that they purchased, 1,473,172 2014: 1,185,596 matching shares that the Company contributed and 261,500 shares 2014: 137,727 in respect of notional dividends.
These amounts exclude unattributed shares and any shares to be withdrawn because the employee has left the Group or requested a withdrawal.
Note 29 Reserves A reconciliation of the movements in each reserve is shown in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 61.
The balance of the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares offset by issue costs, bonus issues of shares and any transfer between reserves.
The balance held in the retained earnings reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the Group.
Cumulative goodwill of 113.8m 2014: 113.8m has been written off against reserves in periods prior to 1 May 1998 in accordance with the UK accounting standards then in force and such goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves.
The capital redemption reserve represents the cumulative par value of all shares bought back and cancelled.
Details of own shares held are given in note 27.
The own shares reserve represents the cumulative cost of shares in Stagecoach Group plc purchased in the market and held in treasury and or by the Groups two Employee Share Ownership Trusts offset by cumulative sales proceeds.
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translations of the financial statements of foreign operations.
It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.

ii The Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have, in the normal course of business, entered into a number of long-term supply contracts.
The most significant of these relate to track, station and depot access facilities, together with train lease and maintenance arrangements.
iii Under UK Rail franchise agreements, the Group and its joint venture, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited, have agreed with the Department for Transport annual amounts receivable or payable in respect of the operation of rail franchises for future periods.
Under these agreements, there is a requirement to comply with a number of obligations.
Failure to comply with these obligations would be a breach of the relevant franchise.
The Group assessed whether a provision for onerous contracts is required in respect of its rail franchises.
The Group has discounted the expected future cash flows related to its rail franchises to determine whether it is probable that the benefits to be derived by the Group from the franchises will be lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the franchises.
Estimates of cash flows are consistent with managements plans and forecasts.
The Group has determined that no provision is necessary.
The estimation of future cash flows and the discount rate involves a significant degree of judgment.
Actual results can differ from those assumed and there can be no absolute assurance that the assumptions used will hold true.
Under certain circumstances following a breach by the Group of one or more of its rail franchise agreements, the Department for Transport has the right to terminate the relevant franchises.
Where the Group has defaulted on one franchise, the Department for Transport has cross-default rights in certain circumstances that might enable it but not require it to terminate all of the franchises.
The financial effect on the Group of a termination of one or more franchises would depend on which, if any, of the Groups contingent liabilities that the Department for Transport sought to call.
As at 30 April 2015, the capital at risk of the Group in this respect was: Virgin Trains South West East Midlands East Coast Trains Trains Total m m m m Actual liabilities Net intra-group amounts payable to train operators 60.7 60.7 Contingent liabilities Season ticket bonds 4.0 59.7 6.3 70.0 Performance bonds 20.0 36.8 30.5 87.3 Parent company guarantees to suppliers 6.6 10.6 17.2 Undrawn committed loan facilities 165.0 25.0 190.0 Capital at risk as at 30 April 2015 195.6 182.2 47.4 425.2 Cash Cash in train operating companies 44.0 154.7 82.3 281.0 Pro forma impact on net debt 239.6 336.9 129.7 706.2 To the extent that any of the above contingent liabilities in respect of Virgin Trains East Coast crystalise the Group is contractually entitled to recover 10% of any such payment from Virgin Holdings Limited.
The Group has credit exposure to Virgin Holdings Limited in this regard.
We consider the likelihood of the contingent liabilities crystallising as being low.
However, if all of the contingent liabilities had crystallised at 30 April 2015, the Group would have needed to have financed 425.2m 2014: 240.0m and its gross debt would have increased by this amount.
In addition, some of the cash in the train operating companies would be transferred with the franchises.
There is no recourse to the Group in respect of any liabilities or contingent liabilities of Virgin Rail Group.

"The US Department of Justice and the New York Attorney General together, ""the Government plaintiffs"" initiated litigation against Twin America and its joint venture partners ""the Defendants"", which include two Stagecoach US subsidiaries in 2012."
The litigation alleges that the formation of the Twin America joint venture in 2009 was anti-competitive.
Separately, private plaintiffs brought a claim based on the same allegations on behalf of a proposed class of customers.
In March 2014, Twin America and lawyers for the private plaintiffs reached agreement on a settlement without any admission of liability.
Settlement has now also been agreed in principle with the US Department of Justice and the New York Attorney General's office.
That settlement remains subject to court approval.
Related to the Twin America litigation involving the Groups North America Division, the Department of Justice is continuing to investigate the conduct of company personnel in responding to discovery obligations in the investigation and litigation.
The Department of Justice has not taken any enforcement action related to these issues, and the Group is co-operating with the investigation.
v The Group and the Company are from time to time party to other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
Liabilities have been recognised in the financial statements for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle obligations arising under such legal actions.
As at 30 April 2015, the accruals in the consolidated financial statements for such claims total 0.1m 2014: 0.1m in addition to the amounts recognised specifically in respect of the Twin America litigation noted in iv above.
In addition, certain of the claims intended to be covered by the insurance provisions see note 24 are subject to or might become subject to litigation against the Group and or the Company.
