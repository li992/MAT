Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page on the inside of the front cover.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: investments in US equity shares and a $ liquidity fund, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company and bank loans, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii to this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company has a 50 million debenture in issue which is repayable in June 2018.
It is the Company's policy to hedge the currency risk in respect of this geared portion of the portfolio using three month forward contracts.
At 31st December 2015 the Company held a number of open contracts with Merrill Lynch and Australian and New Zealand Bank.
The net effect of these contracts is to purchase 50 million for settlement in $ and the latest settlement date of these contracts was 19th January 2016.
Upon maturity, these contracts were rolled over with Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and BNP and the settlement date of these new contracts is 18th April 2016.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

Where the Companys equity investments, which are not monetary items, are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2014: 10% appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the $ which is deemed to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% 2014: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2015 2014 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income return after taxation Revenue return 1,778 1,522 Capital return 1,818 1,968 Total return after taxation for the year 40 446 Net assets 40 446 55 American pp42-62 23 03 2016 23:04 Page 56 Financial Statements continued NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23.
