11 Segmental analysis Accounting policy HSBC has a matrix management structure.
HSBCs chief operating decision-maker is the Group Management Board GMB which operates as a general management committee under the direct authority of the Board.
The GMB regularly reviews operating activity on a number of bases, including by geographical region and by global business.
HSBC considers that geographical operating segments represent the most appropriate information for the users of the financial statements to best evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which HSBC engages, and the economic environments in which it operates.
This reflects the importance of geographical factors on business strategy and performance, the allocation of capital resources, and the role of geographical regional management in executing strategy.
As a result, HSBCs operating segments are considered to be geographical regions.
Geographical information is classified by the location of the principal operations of the subsidiary or, for The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC Bank Middle East and HSBC Bank USA, by the location of the branch responsible for reporting the results or providing funding.

Segmental income and expenses include transfers between segments and these transfers are conducted at arms length.
Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges made.
