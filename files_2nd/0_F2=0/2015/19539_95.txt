Cash generated from operations is the starting point of our cash flow statement on page 109.
This section outlines the adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our accounting profit for the year to the amount of physical cash we generated from our operations.
Net debt represents the amount of cash held less borrowings, overdrafts, finance lease payments due and cash held on behalf of customers.
Borrowings are mostly made up of fixed-term external debt which the Group has taken out in order to finance acquisitions in the past.
