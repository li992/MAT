The interest rate swap is being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of GBP denominated bonds.

30 Capital commitments At 31 December 2015, amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounted to nil 2014: 0.2m.
31 Contingent liabilities The Group has provided, through the normal course of its business, performance bonds and bank guarantees of 88.1m 2014: 86.0m.
32 Employee benefits The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension charge for the defined contribution pension schemes for the year is 85.9m 2014: 78.7m.
In 2015, there was 1 main defined benefit pension scheme where the Group is the sole employing sponsor: The Capita Pension and Life Assurance Scheme Capita scheme.
Grouped together under Other schemes are smaller arrangements: 5 further schemes where the Group is the sole employing sponsor, 3 of which transferred to the Group as a result of the acquisitions of avocis during 2015: an allocated section of a Local Government Pension Scheme where the Group is the employing sponsor: a segregated section of a multi-employer scheme in which the Group is a participating employer: 2 segregated sections in industry wide schemes: and several schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our clients defined benefit pension schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
For the Admitted Body schemes, the Group will only participate in the schemes for a finite period up to the end of the contract with the client.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 152 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Employee benefits continued The 3 schemes inherited with the acquisition of avocis are cash balance schemes where the conversion of the accumulated funds to which guaranteed rates of accumulation apply to a lifetime pension takes place on fixed rates set out in the scheme rules.
The schemes are administered and governed through collective foundations which are separate legal entities.
These pension schemes are HMRC registered pension schemes and are subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
Details of the benefits provided by the schemes are set out in each schemes documentation.
For those schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme and the allocated section of a Local Government Pension Scheme, responsibility for the governance of the schemes lies with boards which operate under a framework of corporate governance and are responsible for following the relevant statutory regulations.
For the other schemes, responsibility for the governance of the schemes lies with the trustees of the scheme and the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees is governed by regulations.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the trust documentation.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds administered by the trustees of the scheme or on behalf of the Board in the case of the Local Government Pension Schemes to meet long-term pension liabilities to beneficiaries.
The trustees or boards as appropriate of the schemes invest the assets in line with their Statement of Investment Principles.
The Statement of Investment Principles has been established after taking into consideration the liabilities of the schemes and the investment risk that the trustees or boards as appropriate are willing to accept.
For those schemes governed by trustees the Group will have been consulted before the Statement of Investment Principles was formally adopted.
For the non-Local Government Pension Schemes the scheme funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004 required trustees to carry out regular funding assessments of the schemes and establish schedules of contributions and recovery plans when there is a shortfall in the schemes.
The recovery plans detail the amount and timing of the contributions required to eliminate the shortfall in the schemes.
Funding assessments are carried out at least every 3 years.
Approximate funding updates are produced at each scheme anniversary, when a full scheme funding assessment is not being undertaken.
At each scheme funding assessment the present value of the contributions detailed in the current recovery plans are compared with any shortfall revealed.
Where the contributions under the current recovery plans are no longer expected by the end of periods specified in the recovery plans to be sufficient to remove the shortfall, new recovery plans will need to be agreed between the trustees and the Group.
Options include increasing contributions due from the Group, extending the recovery periods with additional contributions paid after the expiry of current recovery periods or some combination of the 2.
The affordability to the Group of any increase in contributions is a primary consideration in the agreement of any new recovery plan.
Where the contributions are more than sufficient to remove the shortfall by the end of the recovery period, options include reducing contributions due, keeping the recovery period the same, or shortening the recovery period.
Following the most recent funding assessment of the Capita scheme which was carried out as at 31 March 2014, the Group entered into an agreement to make additional contributions to the Capita scheme over a period of time until 2027.
The next scheme funding assessment will be carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.
For the other non-local government pension schemes, the latest formal valuations for each scheme were carried out between 31 December 2012 and 31 March 2014.
The valuations for the other schemes are updated by qualified actuaries at each balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at their market valuations at each respective balance sheet date.
For the local government pension schemes there is a similar funding regime which is set out in the Local Government Pension Scheme Administration Regulations 2008.
For the Admitted Body schemes, the Group will only participate in the schemes for a finite period up to the end of the contracts.
The Group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the respective Scheme Actuary and as detailed in each schemes Schedule of Contributions.
In addition, the Group will be required to pay some or all of any deficit as determined by the respective Scheme Actuary that is remaining at the end of the contract.
In respect of this, the Group is carrying a sufficient level of provision in these financial statements.
During 2012, the contract with Torfaen County Borough Council came to an end.
This resulted in an exit debt that is due to be paid in 2016.
A provision for this is included in these statements.
These defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, salary risk, market investment risk and currency risk.
Further to a funding plan agreed with the Capita Schemes Trustees in 2012, the Group established the Capita Scotland Pension Limited Partnership the Partnership with the Capita Scheme.
Under this arrangement, intellectual property rights IPR in specific Group software was transferred to the partnership and the rights to use, develop and exploit this IPR was licensed back to the Group in return for an annual fee.
The Capita Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of 8m for 15 years.
The Groups interest in the Partnership is fully consolidated into these Group financial statements.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements.
Separate accounts for the partnership are not required to be, and have not been, filed at Companies House.
Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 153 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Employee benefits continued Under IAS 19 Revised the interest in the Partnership does not represent a plan asset for Group reporting purposes and therefore the Capita Schemes deficit position presented in these accounts does not reflect the Capita Schemes interest in the Partnership.
Accordingly, distributions from the Partnership to the Capita Scheme are reflected in these Group accounts as pension contributions to the Capita Scheme on a cash basis as paid.

The assumptions used for the Capita scheme are tailored for each member.
The assumptions adopted make allowance for an increase in the longevity in the future.
The rate for members currently aged 65 is derived from the pensioner membership and the rate for members reaching age 65 in 20 years time is derived from nonpensioner membership.
