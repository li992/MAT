35 Merger reserve Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
During 2015, the balance of the merger reserve has increased by 5,703 million to 8,974 million 2014: 3,271 million due to the acquisition of Friends Life which attracted merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Refer to note 3 a for further details regarding the acquisition of Friends Life.
