As a consequence, these financial statements include a number of areas of enhanced disclosure which have been provided in order to develop stakeholder understanding of the tax the Group pays.
The table below reconciles the tax which would be expected to be paid on SSEs reported profit before tax to the reported current tax charge and the reported total taxation charge along with additional commentary on the main reconciling items provided beneath the table: 2014 Restated 2015 2015 note 2.1 ii 2014 m % m % Profit before tax 735.2 592.5 Less: share of results of associates and jointly controlled entities 163.6 185.6 Profit before tax 571.6 406.9 Tax on profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 21% 2014 23% 120.0 21.0 93.6 23.0 Tax effect of: Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 86.0 15.1 67.4 16.6 Increase in restructuring and settlement provisions 2.6 0.5 34.4 8.3 Non-taxable gain on sale of shares 13.8 2.4 Fair value movements on derivatives 23.6 4.1 48.0 11.8 Pension movements 11.0 1.9 11.6 2.9 Relief for capitalised interest and revenue costs 22.3 3.9 25.4 6.2 Hybrid capital coupon payments 25.5 4.5 27.8 6.8 Corporation tax relief on PRT paid 4.5 0.8 5.5 1.4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 7.7 1.3 15.6 3.8 Impact of higher current tax rates on E&P profits 42.1 7.4 35.2 8.7 Impact of foreign tax rates 1.4 0.2 0.6 0.1 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 29.8 5.2 21.4 5.2 Reported current tax charge and effective rate 176.5 30.9 201.9 49.6 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 68.5 12.0 48.5 11.9 Increase in restructuring and settlement provisions 2.6 0.5 34.4 8.5 Fair value movements on derivatives 23.6 4.1 48.0 11.8 Pension movements 11.0 1.9 11.6 3.0 Relief for capitalised interest and revenue costs 22.3 3.9 25.4 6.2 Impact of higher deferred tax rates on E&P profits 34.8 6.1 45.6 11.2 Impact of foreign tax rates 4.2 0.7 2.5 0.6 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 6.5 1.1 27.8 6.8 Change in rate of UK corporation tax 15.6 2.7 59.8 14.7 Other items 3.8 0.6 27.4 6.7 Reported deferred tax credit and effective rate 105.7 18.6 55.4 13.6 Group tax charge and effective rate 70.8 12.3 146.5 36.0 The majority of the Groups profits are earned in the UK, with the standard rate of UK corporation tax being 21% for the year to 31 March 2015 201423%.
The Groups Gas Production business is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 29% combined 62%.
In addition, profits from the Sean gas field are subject to petroleum revenue tax PRT at 50% which is deductible against corporation tax, giving an overall effective rate for the field of 79.5%.
Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.
Capital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on property, plant and equipment.
The rates are determined by Parliament annually, and spread the tax relief due over a number of years.
This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the expenditure on property, plant and equipment is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.
Adjustments to the deferred tax charge in respect of previous years inculdes an uplift in the provision required in relation to the acquired Sean Gas field.
The different accounting treatment of property, plant and equipment for tax and accounting purposes means that the taxable income of the Group is not the same as the profit reported in the financial statements.
During both the year to 31 March 2015 and the previous year, the substantial impairments undertaken in relation to certain of the Groups property, plant and equipment, which are explained at note 6, meant that the charge to profit for the year significantly exceeded the amount of capital allowances due to the Group.
Short term temporary differences arise on items such as provisions for restructuring costs and onerous contracts, and retirement benefit obligations, because the treatment of such items is different for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences usually reverse in the year following that in which they arise, as is reflected in the deferred tax charge in these financial statements.
Where interest charges or other costs are capitalised in the financial statements, tax relief is either given as the charges are incurred or when the costs taken to the income statement.
As explained at Accompanying Information A1.3 and at note 32 to the accounts, the Group measures its operating and financing derivatives at fair value under IAS 39.
Due to the financial statements of its subsidiaries being prepared under UK GAAP and following the application of the UK tax disregard regulations, the re-measurement movements have no current tax effect impacting only the deferred tax position.
Financial Statements Financial Statements 9 9.. T Ta ax xa attiio on n c con ont tiinue nued d Some expenses incurred by the Group, while entirely appropriate, are not allowed as an offset against taxable income when calculating the companys tax liability for the same accounting period.
Examples of such disallowable expenditure include legal expenses on investment transactions, and investment impairments.
As detailed at note 29 and explained in the Accompanying Information A1.11 ix, the Group has issued hybrid capital securities which are treated as a component of equity.
While the coupon payments relating to these securities are treated as distributions to the holders of the equity instruments, tax relief is allowed the amount paid in the year.
These tax credits are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.
Reconciliation of tax charge to adjusted underlying current tax As noted at note 3 to the accounts, the Groups results are reported on an adjusted basis in order to allow focus on underlying business performance.
The following table explains the adjustments that are made in order to arrive at adjusted profit before tax.
This is the measure utilised in calculation of the Groups adjusted effective rate of tax.
