The groups investment in Rosneft is a foreign operation whose functional currency is the Russian rouble.
The reduction in the groups equity-accounted investment balance for Rosneft at 31 December 2015 compared with 31 December 2014 was principally due to the weakening of the rouble compared to the US dollar, the effects of which have been recognized in other comprehensive income.
