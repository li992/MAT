The liability recognised in respect of the plan is dependent on anumber of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary inflation and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
External actuarial advice is taken with regard to the most appropriate assumptions touse.
Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below: The impact of a10 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 to increase by approximately 12.4 million: The impact of a10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 to increase byapproximately 11.6 million: The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 toincrease by approximately 18.8 million.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on achange in asingle assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this isunlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation tosignificant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysisare consistent with the previous year.
The weighted average duration of the UK scheme defined benefit obligation is 19.3 years.
