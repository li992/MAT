com 44 Financial review continued Balance sheet management Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions of $62m, purchased syndicate capacity of $10.7m, US admitted licences of $9.3m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects of $9m.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $868.4m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $231.3m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of $210.3m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $658.1m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria e. g. minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium tail.
The chart on page 45 shows the profile of these assets based on their S&P rating at the end of 2015: timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committee.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2015 our provision had reduced to $13.7m 2014: $14.1m in respect of reinsurance recoveries, following a partial recovery during the year in relation to Lehman Re.
Insurance receivables Insurance receivables are amounts receivable from brokers in respect of premiums written.
In order to meet with the accelerated regulatory reporting deadlines under Solvency II, Beazley now makes an earlier determination of how much of written premiums are received versus receivable.
As a result, our premium receivables have grown by 25% year on year whilst gross premiums written have only grown 3% relative to the prior year.
Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the financial statements.
The largest items included comprise: deferred acquisition costs of $226.2m: profit commissions of $12.6m: and deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of $7.1m.
com Annual report 2015 45 Reinsurance debtor credit quality AA 4% AA- 54% A 35% A 3% Collateralised 3% Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of $4,586.7m consist of two main elements, being the unearned premium reserve UPR and gross insurance claims liabilities.
Our UPR has increased by 4% to $1,060.8m.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid of $937.5m and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR of $2,588.4m.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves are broadly unchanged from 2014 at $3,525.9m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises three long term debt facilities: in 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured fixed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
In 2012, we bought back a total of 47.3m in two tranches.
In 2013 we bought back 26.2m of this debt.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25% and the nominal value of this debt as at 31 December 2015 is 76.5m 2014: 76.5m : a US$18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US$ London interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009: and d uring September 2012 we issued a sterling denominated 5.375% retail bond under a 250m euro medium term note programme which raised 75m for the group and is due in 2019.
This diversified the source and maturity profile of the groups debt financing.
A syndicated short term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group plc provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
Under the facility $225m may be drawn as letters of credit to support underwriting at Lloyds.
Of this, 75% may be advanced as cash under a revolving facility.
The cost of the facility is based on a commitment fee of 0.4375% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.25% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will expire on 31 July 2017, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
com 46 Financial review continued Capital structure Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators PRA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
We comply with all IGD requirements.
These requirements will be replaced by Solvency II for year end 2016.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company Inc. We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an on going basis in light of the current regulatory framework, and the changes in regulation currently taking place, i. e. Solvency II and opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However, there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
In 2015, Beazley acquired 0.8m of its own shares into the employee benefit trust.
These were acquired at an average price of 326p and the cost to the group was 2.6m.
The following table sets out the groups sources of funds: 2015 2014 $m $m Shareholders funds 1,441.4 1,342.7 Tier 2 subordinated debt 2026 116.9 122.5 Retail bond 2019 112.3 115.8 Long term subordinated debt 2034 18.0 18.0 1,688.6 1,599.0 Our funding comes from a mixture of our own equity on a Solvency II basis alongside $116.9m of tier 2 subordinated debt, $18m subordinated long term debt, a $112.3m retail bond and an undrawn banking facility of $225m.
com Annual report 2015 47 The following table sets out the groups capital requirement: 2015 2014 $m $m Lloyds economic capital requirement ECR 1,326.9 1,359.0 Capital for US insurance company 107.7 107.7 1,434.6 1,466.7 At 31 December 2015, we have surplus capital of 49% of ECR, including Solvency II adjustments.
Following payment of the second interim dividend of 6.6p and special dividend of 18.4p, this surplus reduces to 35% compared to our current target range of 15% to 25% of ECR.
Individual capital assessment The group is required to produce an individual capital assessment ICA which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
The current capital assessment has been established using our Solvency II internal model which has been run within the ICA regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to determine the capital assessment, we have made significant investments in both models and process: we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and the internal model process is embedded so that teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
Solvency II The Solvency II regime was implemented on 1 January 2016.
During 2015 Beazley obtained approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement at a group level and for Beazley Re dac using our internal model.
This model is also used to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement on an ultimate basis for our managed syndicates, as required for Lloyds capital setting.
The Prudential Regulatory Authority has also approved the Lloyds internal model.
Beazleys programme to prepare for Solvency II began in 2008 and is now substantially complete.
Our project to prepare for the pillar 3 reporting requirements is ongoing and will remain in place until annual reporting for 31 December 2016 is complete.
We believe we are strongly positioned to meet all the reporting requirements.
