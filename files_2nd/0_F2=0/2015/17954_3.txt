He reaches the end of his tenure as an independent director at the AGM in January, however, the board has asked Bob to remain on the board until it is satisfied that it has identified a suitable successor to replace him.
Meanwhile, John Daly will take over from Bob as Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee from the conclusion of the AGM.

On behalf of the entire board I wish her the best of luck for the future in her new role as Chief Marketing Officer for McDonalds, based in the USA.
We are currently in the process of identifying her successor.
The AGM will be held at 11am on Wednesday 27 January 2016 at the offices of Nomura, 1 Angel Lane, London, EC4R 3AB and I look forward to seeing you there.
