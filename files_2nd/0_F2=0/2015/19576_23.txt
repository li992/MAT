A cash box structure was used in such a way that merger relief was available under Companies Act 2006, section 612 and thus no share premium needed to be recorded.
As the redemption of the cash box entitys preference shares was in the form of cash, the transaction was treated as qualifying consideration and the premium is therefore considered to be a realised profit.
