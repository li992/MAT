J. Reynolds.
This combination resulted in the formation of RAI, which was 58% owned by R. J. Reynolds shareholders and 42% owned by the Group.
The Group has concluded that it does not have fide facto control of RAI because of the operation of the governance agreement between the Group and RAI which ensures that the Group does not have the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of RAI: in particular, the Group cannot nominate more than five of the Directors out of 13 or proportionally less if there are less than 13 Directors unless it owns 100% of RAI or some other party owns more than 50%.
In addition, there are no other contractual arrangements which would give the Group the ability to direct RAIs operations.
Manufacturing and cooperation agreements between RAI and the Group have been agreed on an arms length basis see note 29.
On 12 June 2015, RAI completed its acquisition of Lorillard, Inc. Lorillard and related divestiture transactions to ITG Brands LLC, a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, after receiving the required regulatory approval.
At the same time, the intention of which was announced on 15 July 2014, the Group invested US$4.7 billion 3.0 billion of cash in RAI to maintain its 42% equity position in the enlarged business.
The Group has recognised a deemed gain of US$931 million 601 million, as part of the cost of investment.
This has arisen as the contract to acquire shares is deemed to be a financial instrument and was fair valued through the profit and loss, in compliance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
This has been treated as an adjusting item, in line with the Groups policy as described in note 4.
Goodwill of US$529 million 336 million has also been recognised, being the difference between the Groups share of the net assets acquired by RAI, and the deemed fair value of the consideration paid.
RAI recognised a gain on divestiture of assets of US$3,288 million.
The Groups share of this net gain amounted to 371 million net of tax.
This has been treated as an adjusting item, in line with the Groups policy, as described in note 5.
The Groups share of RAI includes 427 million 2014: 472 million of trademarks arising from the RAI transaction in 2004.
The Groups share of non-current assets also includes 708 million 2014: 667 million of goodwill and 327 million 2014: 308 million of trademarks arising from the acquisition of Conwood by RAI in 2006.
In addition, the Groups share of non-current assets includes 7,784 million of trademarks arising from the acquisition of Lorillard by RAI in 2015.
The Groups share of the RAI results for the year to 31 December 2015 includes 55 million 2014: 46 million in respect of external legal fees and other external product liability defence costs.
Details of the Groups contingent liabilities are set out in note 30.
In addition to US litigation involving Group companies, which is covered by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT indemnity referred to in note 30, RAI group companies are named in litigation which does not involve Group companies.
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash flows of RAI, in particular quarterly or annual periods, could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.
ITC Ltd. ITC prepares accounts on a quarterly basis with a 31 March year-end.
As permitted by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, results up to 30 September 2015 have been used in applying the equity method.
This is driven by the availability of information at the half year, to be consistent with the treatment in the Groups interim accounts.
Any further information available after the date used for reporting purposes is reviewed and any material items adjusted for in the final results.
The latest published information available is at 31 December 2015.
