These consisted of impairments and charges in relation to the Groups coal-fired plants at Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry 313.5m, the Aldbrough gas storage facility 163.9m, the North Sea gas production assets 106.1m and certain other assets.
The valuation of the Ferrybridge power station was impacted by the 31 July 2014 fire and both coal plants have been subject to increasingly difficult economic conditions which have been exacerbated by the inability of both units at Ferrybridge and one unit at Fiddlers Ferry to secure an agreement to provide capacity from October 2018 to September 2019 in the first of the capacity auctions run by DECC in December 2014.
The North Sea gas production assets have been impaired predominantly due to declining wholesale gas prices and the gas storage facilities have been impacted by reduced short term price volatility in the wholesale gas market and the announcement in March 2015 of redundancies at the facilities.
In addition to these charges, the Group recognised exceptional charges in relation to the impairment of certain thermal generation development assets including the Abernedd gas-fired generation development in South Wales, which also did not secure a capacity agreement for winter 2018 in the December 2014 auction.
Other exceptional charges were recognised in relation to impairments of thermal power generation, joint ventures and associates.
The Group benefitted from the recognition of 74.8m of exceptional credits in relation to the disposal of businesses and asset that were held for sale at 31 March 2014 before recognition of associated provisions.
This included gains in relation to the seven street lighting PFIs sold to Equitix in November and the Groups share of the dividend from the Environment Energy Funds disposal of its stake in Anesco.
Details of the disposals in the year are included at note 17.
In the previous financial year, the Group recognised exceptional charges arising from and related to asset impairments amounting to 574.9m.
This consisted of impairment charges in respect of thermal and renewable generation plant of 363.9m which included the impact of the decision to scale back the Groups involvement in certain offshore wind developments.
