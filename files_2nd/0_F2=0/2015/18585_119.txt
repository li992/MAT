Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.
GSK Annual Report 2015 169 Strategic report Governance & remuneration Financial statements Investor information Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS S2 standard mortality tables to reect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females.
In the US, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2014 white collar table adjusted to reect recent experience.
These rates are projected using scale BB-2D to allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2035 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK US Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.8 29.9 27.1 28.8 Projected for 2035 29.7 32.0 28.8 30.5 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
In 2013, the target asset allocation of the US plans was also updated to 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plans assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the Plans liabilities might increase.
In line with the agreed mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns and liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations, the Group has dened an overall long-term investment strategy for the Plans, with investments across a broad range of assets.
The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term ination, equities, property, and bank counterparty risk.
The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash ows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19R basis, these cash ows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term ination rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve where an increase in long-term ination corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the US the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US.

In 2013, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identied at the 31 December 2011 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on the funding agreements following the 2011 valuation, the additional contributions are expected to be 85 million in 2016.
The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate: the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reected the asset mix of the schemes.
Employer contributions for 2016, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 540 million in respect of dened benefit pension schemes and 80 million in respect of post-retirement benets.
