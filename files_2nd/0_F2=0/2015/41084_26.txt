Investment property finance lease commitment details are shown in note 16 h. Valuation The Groups investment properties are held at fair value and were revalued at 31 March 2015 by the external valuer, CBRE Limited, a firm of independent qualified valuers in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation Professional Standards 2014.
All the properties are revalued at period end regardless of the date of acquisition.
This includes a physical inspection of all properties, at least once a year.
In line with IFRS 13, all investment properties are valued on the basis of their highest and best use.
For like-for-like properties their current use equates to the highest and best use.
For properties undergoing refurbishment or redevelopment, most of these are currently being used for business accommodation in their current state.
However, the valuation is based on the current valuation at the balance sheet date including the impact of the potential refurbishment and redevelopment as this represents the highest and best use.
The Executive Committee and the Board both conduct a detailed review of each property valuation to ensure appropriate assumptions have been applied.
Meetings are held with the valuers to review and challenge the valuations, ensuring they have considered all relevant information, and rigorous reviews are performed to ensure valuations are sensible.
122 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview 01-15 Strategy and performance 16-53Governance 54-104 Financial statements 105-147 Additional information 148-153 The valuation of like-for-like properties which are not subject to refurbishment or redevelopment is based on the income capitalisation method which applies market-based yields to the estimated rental values ERVs of each of the properties.
Yields are based on current market expectations depending on the location and use of the property.
ERVs are based on estimated rental potential considering current rental streams, market comparatives, occupancy and timing of rent reviews.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, the significant inputs are deemed unobservable under IFRS 13.
When valuing properties being refurbished by Workspace, the residual value method is used.
The completed value of the refurbishment is determined as for like-for-like properties above.
Capital expenditure required to complete the building is then deducted and a discount factor is applied to reflect the time period to complete construction and allowance made for construction and market risk to arrive at the residual value of the property.
The discount factor used is the property yield that is also applied to the estimated rental value to determine the value of the completed building.
Other risks such as unexpected time delays relating to planned capital expenditure are assessed on a project-by-project basis, looking at market comparable data where possible and the complexity of the proposed scheme.
Redevelopment properties are also valued using the residual value method.
The completed proposed redevelopment which would be undertaken by a residential developer is valued based on the market value for similar sites and then adjusted for costs to complete, developers profit margin and a time discount factor.
Allowance is also made for planning and construction risk depending on the stage of the redevelopment.
If a contract is agreed for the sale redevelopment of the site, the property is valued based on agreed consideration.
For all methods the valuers are provided with information on tenure, letting, town planning and the repair of the buildings and sites.
An increase decrease to ERVs Estimated Rental Values will increase decrease valuations respectively, while an increase decrease to yields will decrease increase valuations respectively.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market conditions.
An increase decrease in costs to complete and the discount factor will decrease increase valuations respectively.
The reconciliation of the valuation report total to the amount shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as noncurrent assets, investment properties, is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Total per CBRE valuation report 1,423.4 1,078.0 Deferred consideration on sale of property 21.3 13.2 Assets held for sale 0.3 Head leases treated as finance leases under IAS 17 7.1 3.5 Total investment properties per balance sheet 1,408.9 1,068.3 The Groups Investment properties are carried at fair value and under IFRS 13 are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted.
The different valuation methods are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
As noted in the Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates section, property valuations are complex and involve data which is not publicly available and involves a degree of judgement.
All the investment properties are classified as Level 3, due to the fact that one or more significant inputs to the valuation are not based on observable market data.
If the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes then there could be a transfer between Levels 2 and 3 of classification.
No changes requiring a transfer have occurred during the current or previous year.
The following table summarises the valuation techniques and inputs used in the determination of the property valuation.

Financial risk management objectives and policy The Group has identified exposure to the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk Capital risk management.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will affect the Groups interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate and cross currency swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
The Group has entered into a cross currency swap to ensure the US Dollar liability streams generated from the US Dollar private placement notes are fully hedged into sterling for the life of the transaction.
At 31 March 2015 97% 2014: 89% of Group borrowings were fixed or fixed through the use of interest rate and cross currency swaps.
All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and are in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Board also monitors variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against.
Based upon year end variable rate loan balances, a reasonably possible interest rate movement of -0.5% would have increased and decreased net interest payable and equity respectively by 0.1m 2014: 0.2m.
b Credit risk The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to this risk principally relates to the receivables from tenants, deferred consideration on the sale of investment property and cash and cash equivalent balances held with counterparties.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in relation to receivables from tenants is influenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants occupying its rental properties.
The Group has around 4,000 tenants over approximately 100 properties.
The largest 10 single tenants generate less than 7% 2014: 6% of net rent roll.
As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
The Groups credit risk in relation to tenants is further managed by requiring that tenants provide a deposit equivalent to three months rent on inception of lease as security against default.
Total tenant deposits held are 15.6m 2014: 11.8m.
The Group monitors aged debt balances and any potential bad debts every week, the information being reported to the Executive Committee every month as part of the performance monitoring process.
The Groups debtor recovery is consistently high and as such is deemed a low risk area.
Deferred consideration on the sale of investment property is contractual and valued regularly by the external valuer based on current and future market factors.
Cash and cash equivalents and financial derivatives are held with major UK high street banks or building societies and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2015 2014 m m Cash and cash equivalents note 14 42.6 3.7 Trade receivables current note 13 2.4 2.0 Deferred consideration current note 13 14.1 2.0 Deferred consideration non current note 13 8.7 11.2 67.8 18.9 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 131 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17.
Financial risk management objectives and policy continued c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will always have sufficient funds to meet obligations as they fall due.
This is performed via a variety of methods including daily cash flow review and forecasting, monthly monitoring of the maturity profile of debt and the regular revision of borrowing facilities in relation to the Groups requirements and strategy.
To ensure it can effectively manage its liquidity risk, the Group has an overdraft facility of 4m and a revolving loan facility of 100m.
At 31 March 2015 headroom excluding overdraft and cash was 100m 31 March 2014: 70m.
Cash flow is monitored formally on a monthly basis as part of internal performance monitoring with regular daily monitoring and forecasting undertaken to manage day-to-day cash flows and any balances which are ring-fenced by lenders.
The Board reviews compliance with loan covenants which include agreed interest cover and loan to value ratios, alongside review of available headroom on loan facilities.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables existing at the balance sheet date.
Contracted cash flows are based upon the loan balances and applicable interest rates payable on these at each year end.

Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises term loan facilities, revolving loan facilities from banks, the Retail Bond, private placement notes less cash at bank and in hand.
The foreign currency risk on the US Dollar Private Placement Notes is fully hedged through a cross currency swap.
At 31 March 2015 Group equity was 1,146.3m 2014: 726.1m, and Group net debt debt less cash at bank and in hand was 269.7m 2014: 338.0m.
Following the refinancing in July 2013, the Groups borrowings are now all unsecured.
The loan to value covenants applicable to these borrowings range between 60% and 75% and compliance is being met comfortably.

Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 20.
Non-controlling interests In December 2009 Workspace acquired full control of its former Workspace Glebe joint venture.
The purchase was satisfied by a cash payment of 15m and a debt facility of 68m provided by the former lenders to the joint venture, with further amounts potentially payable under the Glebe Proceeds Share Agreement GPSA.
The GPSA provided for the former lenders to Workspace Glebe to share in net cash proceeds from disposals from the Glebe property portfolio once Workspace received its priority return.
For proceeds up to 170m the lenders share after deducting Workspaces priority return was 50%, from 170m up to 200m it was 30% and nil thereafter.
The maximum payable under the GPSA was capped at 48m.
All disposals were at the option of Workspace and there are no time limits.
In measuring the amount attributable to NCI, the Group took into account the likelihood that a property would be sold and that a payment may be made.
On this basis, the Group attributed amounts to NCI when it considered it probable that it would sell the relevant properties.
No amounts were attributed to NCI in relation to properties that the Group had no intention of selling.
In December 2014 an agreement was reached with the former lenders to terminate the GPSA for a cash settlement of 30m.
The total valuation of the Glebe portfolio at the date of settlement was 222m 31 March 2014: 217m.
While a number of the assets had residential redevelopment potential a substantial part of the portfolio comprised of investment properties that Workspace had no plans to sell.
The value of the properties with redevelopment potential which management considered probable to be sold for cash was 93m at the date of settlement 31 March 2014: 107m.
Total proceeds including cash received to date from disposals of 45m 31 March 2014: 14m would therefore be 138m 31 March 2014: 121m.
It was estimated that net proceeds after costs that would be realised was 131m 31 March 2014: 114m.
As a result, the amount attributable to the former lenders after deducting Workspaces priority return increased by 9m to 20m at the date of settlement 31 March 2014: 11m.
On settlement, the Group derecognised non-controlling interests of 20m and recorded a decrease in equity attributable to owners of the parent of 10m.
In the prior year, the Group was in discussions with the FRC Conduct Committee regarding the accounting for the GPSA.
An alternative view of the measurement basis for NCI would be to attribute the maximum amount that would be payable if all of the properties were sold at their carrying value at the balance sheet date.
The amounts that would then be recognised as NCI would have been a maximum of 48m as noted above.
Management did not believe this approach to be appropriate.
In managements view, the measurement basis adopted best reflects the commercial objectives and economic substance of the GPSA, in particular that no amounts should be attributed to NCI for proceeds that are highly unlikely to arise.
Distribution of amounts payable under the GPSA was recognised as a liability when it was considered that a contractual obligation was established.
At 31 March 2014, we considered there to be a contractual obligation once a redevelopment contract had been exchanged with a third party.
During the year, the Directors further considered the point at which a contractual obligation to pay a distribution arises.
At the point of exchange, there are often still a number of conditions to be satisfied before completion of the contract.
The Directors therefore revised the application of this policy such that a liability was only recognised when the Group had an unconditional legal obligation to make a distribution to the NCI that was no longer at its discretion, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
This is usually on completion of the redevelopment contract.
Other amounts attributable to the GPSA were classified as NCI in the balance sheet.
Had this principle been applied at 31 March 2014 non-current liabilities would have been reported as being nil rather than 11m and NCI would have been reported as 11m rather than nil.
The Directors considered this adjustment to be insufficiently material to warrant a prior year adjustment.
The Group therefore reclassified the liability to equity during the year.
The reclassification has no impact on EPRA NAV or the income statement.
As noted above, during the year an agreement was reached with the former lenders to terminate the GPSA.
At the settlement date no amounts were recognised as a liability as there was no contractual obligation to pay a distribution at that time.
Having adopted the accounting policies for the GPSA described above, the discussions with the FRC Conduct Committee were concluded in November 2014.

Investment in own shares The Company has an Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT to purchase shares in the market for distribution at a later date in accordance with the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme and Long Term Equity Incentive Plan.
The shares are held by an independent trustee and the rights to dividends on the shares have been waived except where the shares are beneficially owned by participants.
No shares were purchased for the Trust during the year but 33,740 shares were transferred to employees on the exercise of share options.
At 31 March 2015 the number of shares held by the Trust totalled 75,226 2014: 108,966.
At 31 March 2015 the market value of these shares was 0.6m 2014: 0.6m compared to a nominal value of 0.1m 2014: 0.1m.
The Company has also established an employee Share Incentive Plan SIP which is governed by HMRC rules.
51,800 shares were purchased for the Plan in 2013 at a cost of 0.2m.
These are being held in a separate trust.

Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share schemes: I Long term equity incentive plan LTIP The LTIP scheme is a performance award scheme whereby shares are issued against three Group performance measures which are assessed over the three year vesting period.
These are: Absolute TSR Relative TSR Relative NAV.
The shares are issued at nil consideration provided the performance conditions are met.
Under the 2014 LTIP scheme 597,967 performance and matching shares were awarded in June 2014 to Directors and senior management 2013 LTIP scheme: 766,728.
Details of the movements for the LTIP scheme during the year were as follows: LTIP Number At 31 March 2013 3,636,840 Granted 766,728 Exercised 1,681,747 Lapsed 65,932 At 31 March 2014 2,655,889 Granted 597,967 Exercised 762,587 Lapsed 1,656 At 31 March 2015 2,489,613 The closing share price at the date of exercise of shares exercised during the year was 6.00 2014: 4.53.
A binomial model was used to determine the fair value of the LTIP grant for the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR elements of the LTIP scheme.
Assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2015 2014 Share price at grant 570p 405p Exercise price Nil Nil Average expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 1% 0.3% Expected dividend yield 2% 3% Average share price volatility 29% 31% Fair value per option Absolute TSR element 221p 162p Fair value per option Relative TSR element 211p 148p The relative NAV is a non-market based condition and the intrinsic value is therefore the share price at date of grant of 570 pence.
At each balance sheet date, the Directors assess the likelihood of meeting the conditions under this element of the scheme.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The assessment at year end was that up to 50% of the relative NAV element will vest.
The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a three year period.
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same period.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.

Grants under ESOS were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Grants under the SAYE scheme are normally exercisable after three or five years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Details of the movements for the ESOS and SAYE schemes during the year were as follows: ESOS SAYE Weighted Weighted exercise exercise Options outstanding Number price Number price At 31 March 2013 51,515 13.22 333,328 1.74 Options granted 66,147 3.47 Options exercised 39,168 1.63 Options lapsed 18,950 8.25 19,720 2.31 At 31 March 2014 32,565 16.12 340,587 2.06 Options granted 126,060 4.59 Options exercised 100,879 1.39 Options lapsed 14,624 13.16 11,262 3.89 At 31 March 2015 17,941 18.53 354,506 3.09 The exercise of all options, other than those obtained under the Groups SAYE scheme, was dependent upon the Group achieving specified performance targets.
The closing share price at the date of exercise for the SAYE options exercised during the year was 7.30 2014:4.50.
126,060 SAYE share options were granted in the year 2014: 66,147 shares.
The fair value has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Inputs to the model are summarised as follows: 2015 2015 2014 2014 SAYE SAYE SAYE SAYE 3 year 5 year 3 year 5 year Weighted average share price at grant 550p 550p 440p 440p Exercise price 459p 459p 347p 347p Expected volatility 28% 28% 31% 31% Average expected life years 3 5 3 5 Risk free rate 1% 1% 0.3% 0.3% Expected dividend yield 2% 2% 3% 3% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 25% 25% 25% 25% The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The expected dividend yield is based on the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.
Fair values per share of these options were: 2015 2015 2014 2014 Grant date Fair value of award Grant date Fair value of award SAYE 3 year 25 July 2014 135p 31 July 2013 118p SAYE 5 year 25 July 2014 151p 31 July 2013 124p III Share incentive plan SIP On 22 March 2013 all staff were granted 1,000 worth of shares.
These shares are held in trust under an HMRC approved SIP.
The shares can be exercised following three years of employment but must be held for a further twoyears in order to qualify for tax advantages.
There were no grants made in the year 2014: nil shares.

Share-based payments continued IV Year end summary At 31 March 2015 in total there were 2,901,188 2014: 3,071,497 share awards options exercisable on the Companys ordinary share capital.
The share awards options outstanding at 31 March 2015 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of: LTIP 1.1 years 2014: 1.5 years, ESOS nil years 2014: nil years, SAYE 1.4 years 2014: 1.6 years, SIP 1 year 2014:2 years.
V Cash-settled share based payments National Insurance payments due on the exercise of non-approved ESOS options and shares from the LTIP are considered cash-settled share based payments.
The estimated fair value of the National Insurance cash-settled share based payments have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
VI Share based payment charges The Group recognised a total charge in relation to share based payments as follows: 2015 2014 m m Equity-settled share based payments 2.0 1.6 Cash-settled share based payments 1.3 0.9 3.3 2.5 The total liability at the end of the year in respect of cash-settled share based schemes was 1.6m 2014: 0.9m.
