Factor affecting Underlying EBIT Method of calculation Financial statement line item affected Change in sales prices Change in average realised price for each operation from the corresponding Revenue period to the current period, multiplied by current period volumes.
Price-linked costs Change in price-linked costs for each operation from the corresponding period Expenses to the current period, multiplied by current period volumes.
Volumes Productivity Change in volumes for each operation not included in the Growth category Revenue and Expenses from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBIT margin.
Volumes Growth Volume Growth comprises Underlying EBIT for operations that are new or Revenue and Expenses acquired in the current period minus Underlying EBIT for operations that are new or acquired in the corresponding period, change in volumes for operations identified as a Growth project from the corresponding period to the current period multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBIT margin, and change in volume for Petroleum Business from the corresponding period to the current period multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBIT margin.
Operating cash costs Change in total costs, other than price-linked costs, exchange rates, inflation Expenses on costs, fuel and energy costs, non-cash costs and one-off items as defined below for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period.
Exploration and business Exploration and business development expense in the current period minus Expenses development exploration and business development expense in the corresponding period.
Exchange rates Change in exchange rate multiplied by current period local currency revenue Revenue and Expenses and expenses.
The majority of the Groups selling prices are denominated in US dollars and so there is little impact of exchange rate changes on Revenue.
Inflation on costs Change in inflation rate applied to expenses, other than depreciation and Expenses amortisation, price-linked costs, exploration and business development expenses, expenses in ceased and sold operations and expenses in new and acquired operations.
Fuel and energy Fuel and energy expense in the current period minus fuel and energy expense Expenses in the corresponding period.
Non-cash Includes non-cash items, mainly depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
Expenses One-off items Change in costs exceeding a pre-determined threshold associated with Expenses an unexpected event that had not occurred in the last two years and is not reasonably likely to occur within the next two years.
Asset sales Profit loss on the sale of assets or operations in the current period minus Other income profit loss on sale in the corresponding period.
Ceased and sold operations Underlying EBIT for operations that are ceased or sold operations in the Revenue, Other income and Expenses current period minus Underlying EBIT for operations that are ceased or sold in the corresponding period.
Share of operating profit from Share of operating profit from equity accounted investments for the period Share of operating profit from equity equity accounted investments minus Share of operating profit from equity accounted investments in the accounted investments corresponding period.

The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$2.0 billion after tax benefit in relation to its Onshore US assets.
The gas-focused Hawkville field accounts for the substantial majority of this charge reflecting its geological complexity, product mix, acreage relinquishments and amended development plans.
The remainder relates to the impairment of goodwill associated with the Petrohawk acquisition.
On 12 November 2014, the Group announced that the review of its Nickel West business was complete and the preferred option, the sale of the business, was not achieved on an acceptable basis.
As a result of operational decisions made subsequent to the conclusion of this process, an impairment charge of US$290 million after tax benefit was recognised in FY2015.
The legislation to repeal the MRRT in Australia took effect on 30 September 2014.
As a result, the Group derecognised a MRRT deferred tax asset of US$809 million, and corresponding taxation charges of US$698 million related to Continuing operations and US$111 million related to Discontinued operations were recognised in FY2015.

A gain on sale of US$385 million after tax expense was recognised in FY2014.
Discontinued operations On 25 May 2015, the Group announced that it completed the demerger of a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver-lead-zinc assets to create an independent metals and mining company, South32.
South32s contribution to BHP Billitons FY2015 results comprised a US$753 million profit after taxation excluding exceptional items.
Exceptional items comprised a tax expense of US$111 million related to the repeal of the MRRT and a net loss on demerger of US$2.2 billion after tax benefit.
This contribution has been included in Attributable loss after taxation from Discontinued operations of US$1.6 billion.
Third party sales We differentiate sales of our production from sales of third party products due to the significant difference in profit margin earned on these sales.
The table below shows the breakdown between our production and third party products.

We engage in third party trading for the following reasons: Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our own assets means that we sometimes source third party materials to ensure a steady supply of product to our customers.
To optimise our supply chain outcomes, we may buy physical product from third parties.
In order to support the development of liquid markets, we will sometimes source third party physical product and manage risk through both the physical and financial markets.
