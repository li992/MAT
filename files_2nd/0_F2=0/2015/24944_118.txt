15 Financial assets designated at fair value Accounting policy Financial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out below, and are so designated irrevocably at inception.
HSBC may designate financial instruments at fair value when the designation: eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring financial instruments or recognising gains and losses on different bases from related positions.
Under this criterion, the main class of financial assets designated by HSBC are financial assets under unit-linked insurance and unit-linked investment contracts.
Liabilities to customers under linked contracts are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the linked funds.
If no fair value designation was made for the related assets, the assets would be classified as available for sale, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income.
The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and reported to management on a fair value basis.
Designation at fair value of the financial assets and related liabilities allows the changes in fair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same line: applies to groups of financial instruments that are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups of financial instruments is reported to management on that basis.
For example, certain financial assets are held to meet liabilities under non-linked insurance contracts.
HSBC has documented risk management and investment strategies designed to manage and monitor the market risk of those assets on a net basis, after considering non-linked liabilities.
Fair value measurement is also consistent with the regulatory reporting requirements under the appropriate regulations for those insurance operations: and relates to financial instruments containing one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives.
Designated financial assets are recognised at fair value when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and are normally derecognised when sold.
Subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in Net income from financial instruments designated at fair value.
