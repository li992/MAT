Notes on the Financial Statements continued 38 Lease commitments 39 Structured entities Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number of deposit takers.
The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from HM Treasury which at 31 December 2015 stood at approximately 16bn $23.7bn.
The Group could be liable to pay a proportion of the outstanding amount that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury.
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Capital commitments In addition to the commitments disclosed on page 441, at 31 December 2015 HSBC had $468m 2014: $656m of capital commitments contracted but not provided for and $100m 2014: $101m of capital commitments authorised but not contracted for.
Associates HSBCs share of associates contingent liabilities amounted to $39,222m at 31 December 2015 2014: $47,593m.
No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable.
38 Lease commitments Accounting policy Agreements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of assets are classified as finance leases.
As a lessor under finance leases, HSBC presents the amounts due under the leases after deduction of unearned charges in Loans and advances to banks or Loans and advances to customers.
As a lessee under finance leases, HSBC presents the leased assets in Property, plant and equipment with the corresponding liability included in Other liabilities.
A finance lease asset and its corresponding liability are recognised initially at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
As lessor, HSBC presents assets subject to operating leases in Property, plant and equipment.
Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that carrying values are not fully recoverable.
As a lessee, leased assets are not recognised on the balance sheet.
Finance income or charges on finance leases are recognised in Net interest income over the lease periods so as to give a constant rate of return.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease periods and are recognised in General and administrative expenses or in Other operating income.
Operating lease commitments At 31 December 2015, future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for land, buildings and equipment were $5,333m 2014: $5,372m.
Finance lease receivables HSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets such as aircraft, property and general plant and machinery.
At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms.
Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.

Structured entities often have restricted activities and a narrow and well defined objective.
Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 1.
HSBC is mainly involved with structured entities through the securitisation of financial assets, conduits and investment funds.
