Share-based payments The Group has granted equity-settled share options and Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP arrangements, and cash-settled share appreciation rights to employees.
Equity-settled share options and LTIP arrangements are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will actually vest.
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, and taking into account the estimated number that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
Details of the terms and conditions of each share-based payment plan are given in the Annual remuneration report on pages 73 to 86.
