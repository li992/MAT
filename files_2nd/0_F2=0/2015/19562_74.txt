The nature of the amounts provided in respect of legal actions, proceedings and other claims is such that the extent and timing of cash flows can be difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided.
The non-current portion of these provisions is expected to be utilised within the next two to five years.
Included are provisions for claims relating to subsidiaries prior to their disposal.
b Dilapidation provisions The Group is required to perform dilapidation repairs and in certain instances restore properties to agreed specifications prior to the properties being vacated at the end of their lease term.
These amounts are based on estimates of repair and restoration costs at afuture date and therefore adegree of uncertainty exists over the future outflows given that these are subject to repair and restoration cost price fluctuations and the extent of repairs to be completed.
The majority of the non-current portion of these provisions is expected to be utilised within the next two to six years.
