Impairment reversals The Group reversed previous impairment charges of 0.7m in the UK, 0.3m of which related to a Grosvenor Casinos venue and 0.4m of which related to a Mecca venue.
The reversal was in respect of venues where changes in the commercial environment had led to improvements in performance.
A further reversal of 0.8m was made in respect of a casino in Belgium which has shown continued improved performance above expectations.
A further reversal of 1.6m was recognised in respect of an Enracha venue which has shown continued improved performance following a competitor closure.

This included a charge of 1.1m in two Grosvenor Casinos venues and 1.0m in respect of a Mecca venue for unavoidable dilapidations costs and where expected income no longer exceeds the unavoidable costs associated with these sites.
In addition a reversal of 0.6m has been made in respect of a Grosvenor Casinos venue where the provision has been reduced due to expected sublet income.
Further movements in the property lease provision are explained under closure of venues below.
Closure of venues During the year the Group has closed, or committed to close, twelve venues.

The only individually signi cant charges were 4.1m in respect of a single club in Grosvenor Casinos venues and 0.7m in respect of a single club in Mecca venues.
Performance at these clubs had not been in line with expectations.
A further impairment charge of 7.5m was recognised in respect of three clubs in the Enracha venues business which had not performed in line with expectations.
This had followed a prolonged period of dif cult economic conditions in Spain.
A further impairment charge of 1.0m was included within integration costs relating to essential post-acquisition capital expenditure, including signage, at a small number of casinos that were fully impaired as part of the acquisition accounting.
Impairment reversals The Group reversed previous impairment charges of 0.7m in the UK, all of which related to Mecca venues.
The reversal was in respect of two clubs where changes in the competitive and commercial environment led to improvements in performance.
A further reversal of 0.8m was made in respect of a casino in Belgium which had shown continuing improved performance above expectations.
Net charge to provisions for property leases The Group recognised a net charge of 6.6m in relation to provisions for property leases.
This included a charge of 6.8m in two Grosvenor Casinos venues and three Mecca venues for unavoidable dilapidation costs and where expected income no longer exceeded the unavoidable costs associated with these sites.
A further charge of 1.6m was made in respect of property lease costs directly attributable to the closure of venues outlined below.
A release to the income statement of 1.8m was recognised in respect of two Mecca venues where anticipated performance, following the reduction in bingo duty, meant that expected income would exceed the unavoidable costs associated with these sites.
Acquisition and integration costs In the year ended 30 June 2013 the Group acquired 19 casinos and three non-operating licences from Gala Coral Group Limited.
The Group expensed the resulting costs of integration of 1.7m.
Closure of venues The Group recognised an exceptional cost of 0.7m relating to the closure of one Mecca venue and one Enracha venue during the year and the provision for the further cost associated with the closure of two further Mecca venues and exit of one Enracha venue in early 2014 15.

During the year ended 30 June 2014, the Court of Appeal found in favour of HMRC and consequently an amount of 26.4m was provided to cover the expected out ow, together with associated interest of 4.3m.
In May 2014 a payment was made to HMRC in respect of these claims, with the remaining balance being the directors best estimate of the out ow likely to arise.
The Group also released 0.3m following the settlement of indirect tax balances.
5 Discontinued operations Discontinued operations, other than those disclosed within exceptional items see note 4, relate to the historic disposal of the loss making Blue Square Bet business.

108 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 10 Earnings per share a Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the pro t attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The only category of dilutive potential ordinary shares is share options.
For share options, a calculation is made to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming exercise of the share options.
There is no difference in the pro t used to determine diluted earnings per share from that used to determine basic earnings per share.
There is no dilutive impact of share options on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue or on earnings per share.
c Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting pro t attributable to equity shareholders to exclude discontinued operations, exceptional items, other financial gains or losses, unwinding of the discount in disposal provisions and the related tax effects.
Adjusted earnings is one of the business performance measures used internally by management to manage the operations of the business.
Management believes that the adjusted earnings measure assists in providing a view of the underlying performance of the business.

Assets held for sale As at As at 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 m m Land and buildings 0.6 Assets held for sale comprise two freehold properties.
It is expected that these properties will be sold within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
13 Impairment review The pre-tax discount rates applied to the different segments of the business are as follows: Segment Discount rate Grosvenor Casinos venues 10.0% Mecca venues 10.0% Enracha venues 11.0% Mecca digital 11.0% In the year ended 30 June 2014 a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% was applied to all segments.
The discount rate calculation is based on the speci c circumstances of the Group and its cash generating units CGUs and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital.
a Impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets with inde nite lives Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
In addition, the Group classi es casino licences with the exception of its concessions in Belgium and Spanish bingo licences as intangible assets with an inde nite life.
i Goodwill At 30 June 2015, the Group has goodwill with a carrying value of 134.3m 30 June 2014: 134.3m.
Digital goodwill 53.4m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rank Digital Limited.
All of this goodwill is allocated to the Mecca digital CGU for the purposes of impairment testing.
In respect of the Mecca digital CGU, the recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections based on the Groups budget for 2015 16, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2014: 2.0% thereafter.
Both the Groups budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are settled stakes, gaming win margins, gaming duty and the discount rate.
Settled stakes represent monies placed by customers for interactive games and are estimated taking into account the product mix and industry developments.
Gaming win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated changes in the budget period.
Gaming duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
112 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.
The key factors which impact the calculation of the carrying value include: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Settled stakes, Gaming win margin Poor or decreased marketing activity Settled stakes Failure to respond to technological advances Settled stakes Deterioration in economic conditions Settled stakes Changes in regulation Settled stakes, Gaming win margin Changes in duties Gaming duty Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by in excess of 74m.
A decrease of approximately 14% in either settled stakes or win margin would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
A rise in gaming duty from 15% to approximately 23% would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
These calculations assume all other assumptions remain constant and therefore do not re ect any cost saving measures that may be identi ed should a key assumption be impacted to this magnitude.
Casino goodwill 80.9m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos from Gala Coral in May 2013.
In respect of this goodwill, each casino is first treated as a separate CGU and tested for impairment in accordance with the policy set out below at 13 ii.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is then tested by treating the combined casinos as a single CGU.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections of the combined casinos from the Groups budget for 2015 16, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2014: 2.0% thereafter.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to casinos and have been based on historic trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent per visit on gaming tables, machines and food and beverages.
This has also been determined by historic trends.
Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino.
The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current levels without indexation.
Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
These are: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by 76m.
A decrease of approximately 5% in either customer visits or spend per visit would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
A rise in gaming-related taxes from the current blended rate of 17.5% to 26.9% across the combined casinos would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
ii Casino licences The carrying value of inde nite life casino licences as at 30 June 2015 was 231.9m 30 June 2014: 231.3m.
The inherent value of a casino licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of a casino as a whole and is therefore not split out from each casino in an impairment review.
Each casino has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each casino, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use has been determined using cash ow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years for freehold properties, based on the Groups budget for 2015 16, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2014: 2.0% thereafter.
Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by experienced senior management supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, where applicable, offers received.
THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 113 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Impairment review continued The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to the casino and have been based on historic trends.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of individual licences to exceed their recoverable amount.
These are: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty As outlined above, each casino licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole.
The level by which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeds its carrying amount therefore varies at each venue and the impact of changes in key assumptions that would be required for the recoverable amount to equal its carrying amount also varies at each casino.
For UK casino licences at venues, the directors do not believe that, with the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a UK casino licence, there are any reasonably foreseeable changes to the key assumptions that would result in a material impairment.
No impairment charges were made during the year against inde nite life casino licences year ended 30 June 2014: nil.
The two casino concessions in Belgium are being amortised over their expected useful life.
At 30 June 2015 these concessions had a carrying value of 4.2m 30 June 2014: 4.8m.
Each of the casino concessions has also been treated as a separate CGU for impairment testing purposes.
As a result of this review an impairment reversal of 0.8m has been recognised in respect of one concession.
iii Spanish bingo licences The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 30 June 2015 was 5.0m 30 June 2014: 3.8m.
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is not therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in an impairment review.
Each individual bingo club has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each Spanish bingo club, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use calculation has been determined using cash ow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years in the case of freehold properties, based on the Groups budget for 2015 16, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2014: nil growth, thereafter.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, bingo duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and beverages.
This has been determined by recent trends.
Bingo duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
As a result of the impairment review, an impairment reversal of 1.8m 30 June 2014: nil has been recognised against the value in use of one bingo licence.
However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that could cause further impairments.
These are: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Bingo duty As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole.
Accordingly, the sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from changes in the key assumptions, varies at each club.
For the clubs previously impaired, each one percentage point reduction in expected future cash ow projections would generate an incremental impairment of 0.1m.
114 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 b Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are grouped into CGUs which are fide ned as individual venues for Mecca, Enracha and Grosvenor Casinos and as the Grosvenor Casino digital and Mecca digital businesses.
Each CGU is assessed for indicators of impairment, such as a signi cant deterioration in trade, and if appropriate a full impairment review is performed.
The key assumptions and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are the same as outlined above for intangible assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use has been determined using cash ow projections from the Groups budget for 2015 16, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2014: 2.0% thereafter.
Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by an experienced surveyor supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable, offers received.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and short-term deposits, other receivables, bank overdrafts and other financial liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments: The fair value of xed rate borrowings is based on price quotations at the reporting date: The fair values of oating rate borrowings and obligations under finance leases approximate their carrying amounts: and The fair values of onerous property leases and lease disposal settlements approximate their carrying amounts as they are discounted at current rates.
THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 119 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group has other receivables and cash and short-term deposits that derive directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Groups senior management oversees the management of these risks.
The finance committee is supported by the Groups senior management that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.
The finance committee provides assurance that the Groups financial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and the financial risks are identi ed, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and Group risk appetite.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market prices.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings and deposits.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the positions at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014.
The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
i Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Groups operating activities when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Groups functional currency and the Groups net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Group policy is not to hedge foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a possible change in the US Dollar and euro, with all other variables held constant, to the Groups pro t before tax and the Groups equity.
The effect on equity, other than the effect of pro t before tax, includes the impact of translation of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
Effect on pro t before tax Effect on equity As at As at As at As at 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 m m m m Change in US$ rate: 10.0% 0.8 0.7 -10.0% 1.0 0.9 Change in euro rate: 10.0% 0.1 4.0 3.8 -10.0% 0.1 0.1 4.0 3.8 ii Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups obligations with oating interest rates.
Historically, the Group had managed its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of xed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
Due to the current economic climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside the Group policy of maintaining between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at xed rates of interest.
At 30 June 2015, 14% of the Groups borrowings were at a xed rate of interest 30 June 2014: 13%.
120 THE RANK GROUP PLC: Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 iii Interest rate sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of loans, borrowings, cash and short-term deposits.
Effect on pro t before tax As at As at 30 June 2015 30 June 2014 m m Sterling: 100 basis point increase 0.8 1.6 200 basis point increase 1.6 3.2 There was no impact on equity in either year as a consequence of loan arrangements.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year.
As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
The Group did not enter into any xed-tooating or oating-toxed interest rate swaps in either year.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily for other receivables and from its nancing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups treasury department in accordance with the Groups policy.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the finance director, and may be updated throughout the year subject to the approval of the Groups finance committee.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The credit worthiness of each counterparty is checked against independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, with a minimum rating of BB required.
The Group predominantly invests with its lending banks when appropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is not considered signi cant.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of its counterparties.
c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have suf cient funds to meet its liabilities.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced three times a year.
The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different scenarios and are reviewed regularly.
Forecast financial headroom and debt covenant compliance are reviewed monthly during the month-end process to ensure suf cient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain exibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
A three-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future nancing needs.
Management actively manages the Groups nancing requirements and the range of maturities on its debt.
The Groups core debt facilities are the 80.0m 30 June 2014: 80.0m bank facility comprising four 20.0m bi-lateral bank facilities, and the 120.0m 30 June 2014: 140.0m bank facility comprising two 60.0m bi-lateral bank facilities.
The Group proactively manages its relationships with its lending group.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversi ed by source and maturity, and to maintain committed facilities suf cient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements.

1 The bank facility interest payments were based on current LIBOR rates as at the reporting date.
Capital management The Groups objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group fide fines shareholders equity and net debt as capital.
In order to protect the capital structure of the Group the directors ensure that there is continuing access to debt facilities and manage the borrowing costs of those facilities.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of leverage ratio.
The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA.

Further details of the LTIP are included in the remuneration report on pages 72 and 73.
The LTIP is an equity settled scheme and details of the movements in the number of shares are shown below: As at 30 June 2015 As at 30 June 2014 Outstanding at start of the year 5,393,769 8,548,832 Granted 4,856,173 946,473 Exercised 106,247 Expired 1,465,608 Forfeited 2,529,681 Surrendered 5,393,769 Outstanding at end of the year 4,856,173 5,393,769 As at 30 June 2015 As at 30 June 2014 Weighted average remaining life 3.2 years 2.1 years Weighted average fair value for shares granted during the year 164.0p 71.3p The LTIP awards granted during the year vest in three tranches: 45% in December 2017, 30% in December 2018 and 25% in December 2019.
All LTIP awards have nil exercise price.
The LTIP awards in issue at the start of the year were surrendered, and replaced by the awards granted during the year.
The surrendered awards had nil value at the point they were surrendered.
The fair value of the LTIP awards granted during the year is based on the market value of the share award at grant date less the expected value of dividends forgone.
In the prior year, when market based performance conditions existed, the fair value of LTIP awards granted was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation which allowed for the incorporation of market performance conditions.
The following table lists the inputs used in the share awards in the prior year: 30 June 2014 Risk free interest rate % 0.34-1.40 Dividend yield % 3.20 Expected volatility % 31.00 Vesting period Years 1-3 Weighted average share price p 140.50 The expected volatility re ects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the award is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
In both years, to the extent that grants are subject to non-market based performance conditions, the expense recognised is based on expectations of these conditions being met, which are reassessed at each balance sheet date.
The Group recognised a 1.1m charge year ended 30 June 2014: 0.5m credit in operating pro t from accounting for share-based payments and related National Insurance in accordance with IFRS 2.
