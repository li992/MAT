150 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financials NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 40. BUSINESS COMBINATION Continued Assets acquired and liabilities assumed The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of ERIL as at the date of acquisition were: Fair value recognised on acquisition Inventories - trading property 96.5 Trade and other receivables 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents 0.6 Deferred tax asset 1.9 99.1 Accruals and deferred income 1.0 Other creditors 3.0 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 73.7 Deferred tax liability 2.1 79.8 Total identifiable net assets at fair value 19.3 Purchase consideration transferred 19.3 The purchase consideration transferred of 19.3m represents that part of the deferred consideration receivable of 35.1m that was recoverable from the fair value of the business acquired as shown above.
The balance of the deferred consideration receivable of 15.8m has been impaired and written off as a charge in the consolidated income statement under the heading Impairment of deferred consideration receivable.
The costs of the acquisition of 2.4m have been expensed in the consolidated income statement within the heading Other expenses.
The overall charge on re-acquisition of ERIL is therefore 18.2m and this has been charged to the consolidated income statement and is shown within non-recurring items in Note 3.
From the date of acquisition, ERIL has contributed nil to the profit after tax and 5.2m to Group revenue.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, we estimate, on a pro forma basis, that the profit after tax for the Group would have been 41.0m and Group revenue would have been 252.4m.
CAPITAL COMMITMENTS The Group has current commitments under a number of its development projects totalling 63.1m as at 30 September 2015 2014: 54.5m.
