Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 149 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations No new or revised IFRS during the year had an impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: Power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee: Rights arising from other contractual arrangements: and The Groups voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it: Derecognises the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity Recognises the fair value of the consideration received Recognises the fair value of any investment retained Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss Reclassifies the parents share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets and other components of non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair values.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
It is then considered in the determination of goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in either profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Investments in associates Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method and are initially recognised at cost, including goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.
However, when the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group is obliged to make further payments to, or on behalf of, the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments, such as trading and investment securities, derivatives and non-financial assets such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 30.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability: or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable: Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
Financial assets Initial recognition Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition.
Date of recognition All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are not entered into with the intention of immediate or short-term resale and are not classified as trading securities or designated as investment securities.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 151 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any other categories.
After initial recognition available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative financial instruments Whilst the Group does not adopt a formal hedge accounting policy, in the ordinary course of business the Group enters into various derivative financial instruments including forwards, swaps and options in the foreign exchange and capital markets.
Such financial instruments are initially recognised in accordance with the policy for initial recognition of financial instruments and are subsequently measured at fair value.
The fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models that take into account the current market and contractual prices of the underlying instruments and other factors.
Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when it is negative.
Gains and losses resulting from these instruments are included in the consolidated income statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies translation differences.
Measurement of financial instruments at initial recognition When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, adjusted, in the case of instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, for directly attributable fees and costs.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price.
If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, then: if the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability i. e. a Level 1 input or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the Group recognises the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price as a gain or loss: in all other cases, the initial measurement of the financial instrument is adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price.
After initial recognition, the Group recognises that deferred difference as a gain or loss only when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.
Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts due from central banks, excluding obligatory reserves with central banks, and amounts due from credit institutions that mature within ninety days of the date of origination and are free from contractual encumbrances and readily convertible to known amount of cash.
Borrowings Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in the group having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of own equity instruments.
Such instruments include amounts due to credit institutions and amounts due to customers including promissory notes issued.
These are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the borrowings are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subordinated debt Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted by the Bank on the international financial markets or domestic market.
The holders of subordinated debt would be subordinate to all other creditors to receive repayment of debt in case of the Banks liquidation.
Subordinated debt is carried at amortised cost.
Finance Group as lessor The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position at a value equal to the net investment in the lease, starting from the date of commencement of the lease term.
In calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments the discount factor used is the interest rate implicit in the lease.
Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivables.
Lease payments received are apportioned between the finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable.
Finance income is based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding.
Operating Group as lessee Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included into other administrative and operating expenses.
152 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued iii.
Operating Group as lessor The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in the consolidated statement of financial position according to the nature of the asset.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term as other income.
The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Initial direct costs incurred specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables For amounts due from credit institutions, loans to customers and finance lease receivables carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risks characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original effective interest rate of the asset.
Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the Group.
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account.
If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the consolidated income statement in the respective impairment line with a negative sign as a reversal of impairment.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate.
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Groups internal credit grading system that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status and other relevant factors.
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group.
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the years on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently.
Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are consistent with, changes in related observable data from year to year such as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, commodity prices, payment status, or other factors that are indicative of incurred losses in the group or their magnitude.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Write-off of loans to customers All retail loans, except mortgages, are written off when overdue by more than 150 days.
Retail mortgage loans are written off when overdue by more than 365 days.
Write off of corporate loans overdue by more than 150 days is subject to management discretion and is evaluated on a case by case basis, taking into account the current and expected positions of the loan borrower.
Available-for-sale financial assets For available-for-sale financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 153 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.
Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement is reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement: increases in their fair value after impairment are recognised in other comprehensive income.
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets carried at amortised cost.
However, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortised cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Future interest income is based on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
The interest income is recorded in the consolidated income statement.
If, in a subsequent year, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Renegotiated loans Renegotiated loans comprise carrying amount of financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.
Where possible, the Group seeks to restructure loans rather than to take possession of collateral.
This may involve extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions.
The accounting treatment of such restructuring is as follows: If the currency of the loan has been changed the old loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised.
If the loan restructuring is not caused by the financial difficulties of the borrower the Group uses the same approach as for the modification of financial liabilities described below.
If the loan restructuring is due to the financial difficulties of the borrower and the loan is impaired after restructuring, the Group recognises the difference between the present value of the new cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate and the carrying amount before restructuring in the provision charges for the period.
In cases where the loan is not impaired after restructuring, the Group recalculates the effective interest rate.
Once the terms have been renegotiated, the loan is no longer considered past due.
Management continuously reviews renegotiated loans to ensure that all criteria are met and that future payments are likely to occur.
The loans continue to be subject to an individual or collective impairment assessment, calculated using the loans original or current effective interest rate.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and the Group either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and or purchased option including a cash-settled option or similar provision on the transferred asset, the extent of the Groups continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option including a cash-settled option or similar provision on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the Groups continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Financial guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the Group gives financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, guarantees and acceptances.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, in Other liabilities, being the premium received.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Groups liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amortised premium and the best estimate of expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.
154 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is taken to the consolidated income statement.
The premium received is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and conditions are accounted for, as follows: Raw materials: purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Taxation The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in the respective territories in which BGEO and its subsidiaries operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Georgia and Belarus also have various operating taxes that are assessed on the Groups activities.
These taxes are included as a component of other operating expenses.
Investment properties Investment property is land or building or a part of a building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation and which is not used by the Group or held for the sale in the ordinary course of business.
Property that is being constructed or developed or redeveloped for future use as an investment property is also classified as an investment property.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently remeasured at fair value reflecting market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Fair value of the Groups investment property is determined on the basis of various sources including reports of independent appraisers, who hold a recognised and relevant professional qualifications and who have recent experience in valuation of property of similar location and category.
Investment property that is being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property or for which the market has become less active continues to be measured at fair value.
Earned rental income is recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking Business companies and within real estate revenue for Investment Business companies.
Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are recorded in the income statement within net other banking income for Banking Business companies and within real estate revenue or gross other investment profit for Investment Business companies, depending on weather the gains derive from active property development or passive appreciation respectively.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.
If an investment property becomes owner-occupied, it is reclassified to property and equipment, and its carrying amount at the date of reclassification becomes its deemed cost to be subsequently depreciated.
Property and equipment Property and equipment, except for office buildings and service centres, is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment in value.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.
Office buildings and service centres are measured at fair value less depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 155 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Following initial recognition at cost, office buildings and service centres are carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Valuations are performed once in every three years, unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market.
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve for property and equipment included in other comprehensive income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the revaluation reserve for property and equipment.
An annual transfer from the revaluation reserve for property and equipment to retained earnings is made for the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the assets and depreciation based on the assets original cost.
Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the devalued amount of the asset.
Upon disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset, commences from the date the asset is ready and available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Years Office buildings and service centres Up to 100 Hospitals and clinics Up to 100 Furniture and fixtures 10 Computers and equipment 5-10 Motor vehicles 5 The assets residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Assets under construction are stated at cost and are not depreciated until the time they are available for use and reclassified to respective group of property and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the related leased asset or the expected lease term if lower.
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when incurred and included in other operating expenses, unless they qualify for capitalization.
Goodwill Impairment Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated: represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes: and is not larger than a segment as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit group of cash-generating units is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Impairment losses cannot be reversed in future periods.
Intangible assets The Groups intangible assets include computer software and licenses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite and amortised over 4 to 10 years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Amortisation periods and methods for intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recorded as an expense as incurred.
Software development costs relating to the design and testing of new or substantially improved software are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the software so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the asset and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the asset and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the development.
Other software development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
156 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Insurance and reinsurance receivables Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised based upon insurance policy terms and measured at cost.
The carrying value of insurance and reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
Reinsurance receivables primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities.
Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business.
Amounts due to reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated reinsured policies and in accordance with the reinsurance contract.
Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis.
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance assets when an indication of impairment occurs.
Reinsurance receivables are impaired only if there is objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract that this can be measured reliably.
Insurance liabilities General insurance liabilities General insurance contract liabilities are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries.
Significant delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, particularly in respect of liability business, environmental and pollution exposures therefore the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the reporting date.
Provision for unearned premiums The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as unearned premium.
The change in the provision for unearned premium is taken to the consolidated income statement in order that revenue is recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, the amount of expected future benefit payments.
Liability adequacy test At each reporting date, a liability adequacy test is performed, to ensure the adequacy of unearned premiums net of related deferred acquisition costs.
In performing the test, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any inadequacy is immediately charged to the consolidated income statement by establishing an unexpired risk provision.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can be made.
Provisions for the risk of incurring losses on off-balance sheet commitments is estimated regularly based on the past history of actual losses incurred on these commitments.
Retirement and other employee benefit obligations The Group provides management and employees of the Group with private pension plans.
These are defined contribution pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees of the Group.
The Group collects contributions in the size of 2% of full-time employees salaries, of which 1% is deducted from the salaries and the other 1% additionally paid by the Group.
When an employee reaches the pension age, aggregated contributions, plus any earnings earned on the employees behalf are paid to the employee according to the schedule agreed with the employee.
Aggregated amounts are distributed during the period when the employee will receive accumulated contributions.
Respective pension benefit obligations are recorded within other liabilities, Note 15.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including senior executives of the Group receive share-based remuneration, whereby employees render services as consideration for the equity instruments equity settled transactions.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date when the relevant employee is fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The consolidated income statement charge or credit for the period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for the awards that do not ultimately vest except for the awards where vesting is conditional upon market conditions a condition linked to the price of BGEOs shares which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 157 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Where the terms of an equity settled award are modified, the minimum expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as the replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and the new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Share capital Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than on a business combination, are shown as a deduction from the proceeds in equity.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Treasury shares Where BGEO or its subsidiaries purchase BGEOs shares, the consideration paid, including any attributable transaction costs, net of income taxes, is deducted from total equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in equity.
Treasury shares are stated at par value, with adjustment of premiums against additional paid-in capital.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared before or on the reporting date.
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the reporting date or proposed or declared after the reporting date but before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.
Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote.
A contingent asset is not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Income and expense recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expense is recognised: Interest and similar income and expense For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, interest income or expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument for example, prepayment options and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses.
The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts.
The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense.
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognised using the original effective interest rate applied to the new carrying amount.
Fee and commission income The Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of services it provides to its customers.
Fee income can be divided into the following two categories: Fee income earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time Fees earned for the provision of services over a period of time are accrued over that period.
These fees include commission incomes and asset management, custody and other management and advisory fees.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred together with any incremental costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan.
Fee income from providing transaction services Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party such as the arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction.
Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain performance are recognised after fulfilling the corresponding criteria.
Dividend income Revenue is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment is established.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Insurance premium income For property & casualty and health insurance business, premiums written are recognised at policy inception and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policy coverage.
Estimates of premiums written as at the reporting date but not yet received, are assessed based on estimates from underwriting or past experience and are included in premiums earned.
Insurance claims General insurance claims incurred include all claim losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, including the related handling costs and reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.
Healthcare revenue The Group recognises healthcare revenue when the amount can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity.
Healthcare revenue is presented net of corrections and rebates that occasionally arise as a result of reconciliation of detailed bills with counterparties mostly with the state.
Healthcare revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for providing impatient and outpatient services and includes following components: Healthcare revenue from insurance companies The Group recognises revenue from the individuals who are insured by various insurance companies based on the completion of the actual medical service and agreed-upon terms between the counterparties: Healthcare revenue from state The Group recognises the revenue from the individuals who are insured under the state programs based on the completion of the actual medical service and the agreed-upon terms between the counterparties: Healthcare revenue from out-of-pocket and other The Group recognises the revenue from non-insured individuals based on the completion of the actual medical service and approved prices by the Group.
Sales are usually in cash or by credit card.
Other revenue from medical services includes revenue from municipalities and other hospitals, which the Group has contractual relationship with.
Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered calculated according to contractual tariffs.
Gross real estate profit and Gross other investment profit Gross real estate profit comprises revenue from sale of developed real estate property and revaluation gains on such developed properties.
Revenue from sale of developed real estate property is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the real estate have been transferred to the buyer.
Gross other investment profit comprises revenue from sale of other finished goods and revaluation of other investment properties that were not developed by the Group.
Revenue from the sale of other finished goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.
Continuous transfer of work in progress is applied when: a the buyer controls the work in progress, typically when the land on which the development is taking place is owned by the final customer and b all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the work in progress in its present state are transferred to the buyer as construction progresses, typically when buyer cannot put the incomplete property back to the Group.
In such situations, the percentage of work completed is measured based on the costs incurred up until the end of the reporting period as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred.
EBITDA The Group separately presents EBITDA on the face of income statement for Investment Business.
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, as well as cost of credit risk and net non-recurring items for the Investment Business.
Non-recurring income and expenses The Group separately classifies and discloses those income and expenses that are non-recurring by nature.
Any type of income or expense may be non-recurring by nature.
The Group defines non-recurring income or expense as an income or expense triggered by or originated from an extraordinary economic, business or financial event that is not inherent to the regular and ordinary business course of the Group and is caused by uncertain or unpredictable external factors.
Typical non-recurring income or expenses are but not limited to the following: Bankruptcy of a subsidiary or an associate or any other extraordinary and irregular event that causes material impairment of an investment in that subsidiary or associate or impairment of associated goodwill: Expenses incurred for the purposes of initial public offering IPO that are not directly attributable to issuance of new shares but are rather associated with the listing of existing shares: Gains from bargain purchases negative goodwill associated with business combinations: Impairment of property and equipment, which is an additional loss in excess of a regular depreciation charge caused by unexpected external factors: Gains or losses from hyperinflation: Gains or losses from breaches of borrowings before maturity: Redundancy expenses and costs of lay off of management and executives: Failure of a software or license provider to complete implementation of a software or license through a breach of agreement with the Group, resulting in legal disputes and or litigations.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Change in Presentation of Statement of Financial Position and Income Statement The Group changed the reporting format to reflect its recently updated strategy to operate as a Georgia-focused banking group with an investment arm.
As a result, consolidated statements of financial position and income statement are presented as a combination of the Groups Banking and Investment businesses with corresponding inter-business eliminations.
Certain line items of the statement of financial position and the income statement were reorganised to provide a more relevant presentation of these two distinct parts of the Group.
Reclassifications Starting from 2015, BGEO separated investment in associates from other assets in its separate financial statements and amended comparative financial information accordingly.
Due to the change in the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial position, the following reclassifications were made to the 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 statements of financial position to conform to the year ended 31 December 2015 presentation requirements: As previously As at Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: reported Reclassification As reclassified 31 December 2014 Loans to customers 4,322,186 4,322,186 31 December 2014 Finance lease receivables 38,519 38,519 31 December 2014 Investments in associates 48,659 48,659 31 December 2014 Other assets 351,687 141,976 209,711 31 December 2014 Loans to customers and finance lease receivables 4,350,803 4,350,803 31 December 2014 Accounts receivable and other loans 67,255 67,255 31 December 2014 Insurance premiums receivable 31,840 31,840 31 December 2014 Inventories 101,442 101,442 31 December 2014 Current income tax assets 4,215 4,215 31 December 2014 Deferred income tax assets 18,530 18,530 31 December 2014 Income tax assets 22,745 22,745 31 December 2014 Current income tax liabilities 11,093 11,093 31 December 2014 Deferred income tax liabilities 86,471 86,471 31 December 2014 Income tax liabilities 97,564 97,564 31 December 2014 Provisions 4,732 4,732 31 December 2014 Other liabilities 238,122 150,477 87,645 31 December 2014 Accruals and deferred income 108,623 108,623 31 December 2014 Insurance contracts liabilities 46,586 46,586 As previously As at Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: reported Reclassification As reclassified 31 December 2013 Loans to customers 3,477,309 3,477,309 31 December 2013 Finance lease receivables 45,606 45,606 31 December 2013 Other assets 329,339 182,530 146,809 31 December 2013 Loans to customers and finance lease receivables 3,514,870 3,514,870 31 December 2013 Accounts receivable and other loans 40,419 40,419 31 December 2013 Insurance premiums receivable 61,947 61,947 31 December 2013 Inventories 88,209 88,209 31 December 2013 Current income tax assets 4,552 4,552 31 December 2013 Deferred income tax assets 14,544 14,544 31 December 2013 Income tax assets 19,096 19,096 31 December 2013 Current income tax liabilities 2,930 2,930 31 December 2013 Deferred income tax liabilities 66,100 66,100 31 December 2013 Income tax liabilities 69,030 69,030 31 December 2013 Provisions 481 481 31 December 2013 Other liabilities 206,576 155,341 51,235 31 December 2013 Accruals and deferred income 82,103 82,103 31 December 2013 Insurance contracts liabilities 73,719 73,719 160 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Due to the change in the presentation of income statement, the following line items were divided into Banking Business and Investment Business parts and placed above and below revenue respectively.
The following main reclassifications were made to the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 income statements to conform to the 31 December 2015 presentation requirements: As previously Year ended Consolidated Income Statement: reported Reclassification As reclassified 31 December 2014 Interest income 594,921 594,921 31 December 2014 Banking interest income 593,612 593,612 31 December 2014 Interest income from investment business 1,309 1,309 31 December 2014 Interest expense 250,861 250,861 31 December 2014 Salaries and other employee benefits 153,807 374 154,181 31 December 2014 General and administrative expenses 73,183 276 73,459 31 December 2014 Banking interest expense 243,654 243,654 31 December 2014 Interest expense from investment business 6,558 6,558 31 December 2014 Depreciation and amortization 28,207 28,207 31 December 2014 Cost of healthcare services 78,836 6,599 72,237 31 December 2014 Banking depreciation and amortization 25,641 25,641 31 December 2014 Depreciation and amortization of investment business 9,164 9,164 31 December 2014 Net gain from foreign currencies: dealing 44,168 44,168 31 December 2014 Net gain from foreign currencies: translation differences 5,415 5,415 31 December 2014 Net banking foreign currency gain 52,752 52,752 31 December 2014 Net foreign currency loss from investment business 3,169 3,169 As previously Year ended Consolidated Income Statement: reported Reclassification As reclassified 31 December 2013 Interest income 574,108 574,108 31 December 2013 Banking interest income 572,362 572,362 31 December 2013 Interest income from investment business 1,746 1,746 31 December 2013 Interest expense 259,613 259,613 31 December 2013 Salaries and other employee benefits 135,055 7 135,048 31 December 2013 General and administrative expenses 60,364 4 60,360 31 December 2013 Banking interest expense 253,926 253,926 31 December 2013 Interest expense from investment business 5,687 5,687 31 December 2013 Depreciation and amortization 26,572 26,572 31 December 2013 Cost of healthcare services 37,644 5,160 32,484 31 December 2013 Banking depreciation and amortization 24,780 24,780 31 December 2013 Depreciation and amortization of investment business 6,963 6,963 31 December 2013 Net gain from foreign currencies: dealing 46,329 46,329 31 December 2013 Net gain from foreign currencies: translation differences 2,818 2,818 31 December 2013 Net banking foreign currency gain 48,355 48,355 31 December 2013 Net foreign currency loss from investment business 4,844 4,844 Functional, reporting currencies and foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in Georgian Lari, which is the Groups presentation currency.
BGEOs and the Banks functional currency is Georgian Lari.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency, converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into functional currency at functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised in the consolidated income statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies translation differences.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a certain transaction and the NBG exchange rate on the date of the transaction are included in gains less losses from foreign currencies dealing.
The official NBG exchange rates at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 were: Lari to BYR Lari to GBP Lari to US$ Lari to EUR 10,000 31 December 2015 3.5492 2.3949 2.6169 1.2904 31 December 2014 2.8932 1.8636 2.2656 1.5727 31 December 2013 2.8614 1.7363 2.3891 1.8258 Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 161 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the entities whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group are translated into Georgian Lari at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and, their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken to other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a subsidiary or an associate whose functional currency is different from the presentation currency of the Group, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that particular entity is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at the rate at the reporting date.
Change in Functional Currency Prior to 1 January 2007, the Bank determined that Georgian Lari was its functional currency, as it was the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operated.
However, in 2007 the Bank determined that US Dollar USD was its functional currency, due to the following: The US Dollars share of the Banks assets and liabilities was constantly increasing: Pricing of the loans was primarily based on the cost of funds which were sourced primarily from US Dollars denominated offshore banking borrowings and deposits, at the same time Global Depositary Receipts GDR of the Bank floated on the London Stock Exchange, and were priced and traded in US Dollars: After the Bank had listed its shares in the form of GDRs on the London Stock Exchange in November 2006, communication, planning and execution of business activities of the Bank with shareholders were generally in US Dollars.
In 2015 the Bank performed a re-assessment of its functional currency in accordance with International Accounting Standard 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates IAS 21 and determined that Georgian Lari was its functional currency, due to the following: US Dollars share of the Banks assets is stable and no longer increasing, while US Dollars share of liabilities is constantly decreasing: Due to their decreasing share in debt financing, pricing of the loans is constantly becoming less dependent on US Dollars denominated offshore banking borrowings and deposits, while following the listing of BGEO on the premium listing segment of the London Stock Exchange in February 2012, the Banks equity financing source also changed from US Dollars to British Pounds Sterling GBP : Communication, planning and execution of business activities of the Bank with shareholders has become less relevant, concentrating more on Georgian Lari and GBP: Following listing on the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange, share-based compensation of the management has changed from being US Dollars denominated to being GBP denominated: In 2015 BGEO also performed a re-assessment of its functional currency in accordance with IAS 21 and determined that Georgian Lari was its functional currency as well, due to the fact that BGEO is a holding company that has no sufficiently substantive operations to enable it to have a different functional currency from its subsidiary.
As the result, the Bank and BGEO changed their functional currencies, from US Dollars and GBP respectively, to Georgian Lari starting 1 January 2015 and this has been accounted for prospectively from that date.
Share capital, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings of BGEO were retranslated to Georgian Lari from the 31 December 2014 GBP-GEL exchange rate of 2.8932 to the 1 January 2015 exchange rate of 2.9220.
This movement is shown as a GBP-GEL translation effect in the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Standards issued but not yet effective Up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published that are not yet effective for the current reporting period and which the Group has not early adopted.
Such standards that are expected to have an impact on the Group, or the impacts of which are currently being assessed, are as follows: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and is currently assessing its impact of IFRS 9.
IAS 12 Income Taxes In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes.
The amendments clarify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value and clarify recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses, to address diversity in practice.
Entities are required to apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, when the IASB finalises their amendments to defer the effective date of IFRS 15 by one year.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
162 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases with an effective date of annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 results in lessees accounting for most leases within the scope of the standard in a manner similar to the way in which finance leases are currently accounted for under IAS 17 Leases.
Lessees will recognise a right of use asset and a corresponding financial liability on the balance sheet.
The asset will be amortised over the length of the lease and the financial liability measured at amortised cost.
Lessor accounting remains substantially the same as in IAS 17.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 on its financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business of which the asset is part rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset.
As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets.
The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants The amendments change the accounting requirements for biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants.
Under the amendments, biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants will no longer be within the scope of IAS 41.
After initial recognition, bearer plants will be measured under IAS 16 at accumulated cost before maturity and using either the cost model or revaluation model after maturity.
The amendments also require that produce that grows on bearer plants will remain in the scope of IAS 41 measured at fair value less costs to sell.
For government grants related to bearer plants, IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance will apply.
The amendments are retrospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
These amendments are not expected to have material impact on the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The amendments address the conflict between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture.
The amendments clarify that the gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3, between an investor and its associate or joint venture, is recognised in full.
Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that do not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate or joint venture.
These amendments must be applied prospectively and are not expected to have any impact on the Group.
Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
They include: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations Assets or disposal groups are generally disposed of either through sale or distribution to owners.
The amendment clarifies that changing from one of these disposal methods to the other would not be considered a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original plan.
There is, therefore, no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5.
This amendment must be applied prospectively.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures i Servicing contracts The amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset.
An entity must assess the nature of the fee and the arrangement against the guidance for continuing involvement in IFRS 7 in order to assess whether the disclosures are required.
The assessment of which servicing contracts constitute continuing involvement must be done retrospectively.
However, the required disclosures would not need to be provided for any period beginning before the annual period in which the entity first applies the amendments.
ii Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements do not apply to condensed interim financial statements, unless such disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported in the most recent annual report.
This amendment must be applied retrospectively.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits The amendment clarifies that market depth of high quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the obligation is located.
When there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be used.
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting The amendment clarifies that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the interim financial report e. g. in the management commentary or risk report.
The other information within the interim financial report must be available to users on the same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 163 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements.
The amendments clarify: The materiality requirements in IAS 1 That specific line items in the statement s of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial position and the statement s of profit or loss and OCI.
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception The amendments address issues that have arisen in applying the investment entities exception under IFRS 10.
The amendments to IFRS 10 clarify that the exemption from presenting consolidated financial statements applies to a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an investment entity, when the investment entity measures all of its subsidiaries at fair value.
Furthermore, the amendments to IFRS 10 clarify that only a subsidiary of an investment entity that is not an investment entity itself and that provides support services to the investment entity is consolidated.
All other subsidiaries of an investment entity are measured at fair value.
The amendments to IAS 28 allow the investor, when applying the equity method, to retain the fair value measurement applied by the investment entity associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries.
These amendments must be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the board of directors and management use their judgment and make estimates in determining the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
The most significant judgments and estimates are as follows: Fair value of financial instruments Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models.
The input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values Note 30.
Measurement of fair value of investment properties and property and equipment The fair value of investment properties and office buildings and service centres included in property and equipment is determined by independent professionally qualified appraisers.
Fair value is determined using a combination of the internal capitalization method also known as discounted future cash flow method and the sales comparison method.
The Group performs valuation of its investment properties, and office buildings and service centres once in every three years, unless there is a sign of material change in fair values on the market.
Last valuation was performed as at 31 December 2015 by Colliers International Georgia.
Results of this valuation are presented in notes 11 and 12, while valuation inputs and techniques are presented in note 30.
The estimates described above are subject to change as new transaction data and market evidence become available.
Allowance for impairment of loans and finance lease receivables The Group regularly reviews its loans and finance lease receivables to assess impairment.
The Group uses its judgment to estimate the amount of any impairment loss in cases where a borrower is in financial difficulties and there are few available sources of historical data relating to similar borrowers.
Similarly, the Group estimates changes in future cash flows based on the observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group.
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the group of loans and finance lease receivables.
The Group uses its judgment to adjust observable data for a group of loans and finance lease receivables to reflect current circumstances.
The Group considers the fair value of collateral when estimating the amount of impairment loss for collateralised loans and finance lease receivables.
Management monitors market value of collateral on a regular basis.
Management uses its experienced judgment or independent opinion to adjust the fair value to reflect current circumstances.
The amount and type of collateral required depends on the assessment of credit risk of the counterparty.
Information about allowance for impairment of loans and finance lease receivables is presented in Note 10.

Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering from one to three-year period.
Discount rates were not adjusted for either a constant or a declining growth rate beyond the three-year periods covered in financial budgets.
For the purposes of the impairment test, a 3% permanent growth rate has been assumed when assessing the future operating cash flows of the CGU.
The following discount rates were used by the Group for Corporate Banking and Retail Banking: Corporate Banking Retail Banking 2015, 2014, 2013, 2015, 2014, 2013, % % % % % % Discount rate 5.8% 6.2% 8.5% 6.7% 6.5% 8.5% The following rates were used by the Group for P&C Insurance and Health Insurance: P&C Insurance Health Insurance 2015, 2014, 2013, 2015, 2014, 2013, % % % % % % Discount rate 10.4% 10.9% 13.3% 11.2% 11.3% 14.5% The following rates were used by the Group for Healthcare and Liberty Consumer: Healthcare Liberty Consumer 2015, 2014, 2013, 2015, 2014, 2013, % % % % % % Discount rate 11.6% 10.5% 14.5% 9.4% 9.0% 14.5% Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 181 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 13.
Goodwill continued Discount rates Discount rates reflect managements estimate of return required in each business.
This is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future investment proposals.
Discount rates are calculated by using weighted average cost of capital WACC.
For the Healthcare CGU the following additional assumptions were made over the first three-year period of the business plan: Further synergies from healthcare businesses will increase cost efficiency and further improve operating leverage: Growth of other healthcare business lines through an increased market demand and economic growth.
For the Retail and Corporate banking CGUs the following additional assumptions were made: Stable, business as usual growth of loans and deposits: No material changes in cost income structure or ratio: Stable, business as usual growth of trade finance and other documentary businesses: Further expansion of the express banking businesses bringing more stable margins to retail banking.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that reasonable possible changes to key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each CGU will not result in an impairment of goodwill.
The excess of value in use over carrying value is determined by reference to the net book value as at 31 December 2015.
Possible change was taken as -1% in discount rate and growth rate.

This creates tax risks in Georgia and Belarus, substantially more significant than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems.
Management believes that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations.
However, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretative issues.

Risk Management Introduction Risk is inherent in the Groups activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
This process of risk management is critical to the Groups continuing profitability and each individual within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter being subdivided into trading and non-trading risks.
It is also subject to operational risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry.
They are monitored through the Groups strategic planning process.
Risk management structure Audit Committee The Audit Committee is an independent body and is directly monitored by the Board.
It has the overall responsibility for developing and implementation of overall risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies, principles, frameworks, policies and limits.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the fundamental risk issues and manages and monitors relevant risk decisions covering, but not limited to: macroeconomic and environmental risks, general control environment, manual and application controls, risks of intentionally or unintentional misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, information security, anti-money laundering, information technology risks, etc.
Risk Committee The Risk Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Groups risk appetite and exposure are addressed as part of strategy and appropriateness of risk strategy and appetite: oversee and advise the Board on the current and emerging risk exposures of the Group: oversee and monitor the implementation of the risk strategy by senior management to address the risk exposures of the Group: review the effectiveness of the Groups risk management framework and internal control systems other than internal financial control systems which is the responsibility of the BGEO Audit Committee : assess the adequacy and quality of the risk management function and the effectiveness of risk reporting within the Group: ensure that risk is properly considered in setting the Groups remuneration policy: oversee the communication of the tone from top related to risk management to every level of the business through senior management: review and approve the Groups risk management policy.
Management Board The Management Board has the responsibility to monitor and manage the entire risk process within the Group, on a regular basis, by assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk management policies and procedures as well as respective guidelines and controlling the implementation and performance of relevant departments and committees.
Bank Asset and Liability Management Committee The Banks Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO is the core risk management body.
It is responsible for managing the Banks assets and liabilities, all risks associated with them as well as the overall financial structure of the Group.
It is also primarily responsible for the funding, capital adequacy risk, liquidity risks and market risks of the Bank.
Internal Audit Risk management processes throughout the Group are audited annually by the internal audit function that examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Groups compliance with the procedures.
Internal Audit discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Audit Committee.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 195 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29.
Risk Management continued Risk measurement and reporting systems The Groups risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models.
The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment.
The Group runs three different basic scenarios, of which one is Base Case forecast under normal business conditions and the other two are Troubled and Distressed Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group.
These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected industries.
In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risks types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks.
This information is presented and explained to the Management Board, and the head of each business division.
The reports include aggregate credit exposures and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile.
Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis.
The Management Board receives a comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month.
These reports are designed to provide all the necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group.
Risk measurement and reporting systems For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that all business divisions have access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of market limits, proprietary investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments.
Risk mitigation As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from forecast transactions.
While these are intended for hedging, these do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks see below for more detail.
Excessive risk concentration Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or these counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
Concentrations also involve combined, aggregate exposures of large and significant credits compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial instrument.
Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Groups performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Groups policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio of both, financial assets as well as financial liabilities.
Identified concentrations of credit risks or liquidity repayment risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties failed to discharge their contractual obligations.
The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits.
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties, including regular collateral revisions.
Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty a risk rating.
Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action.
Derivative financial instruments Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded in the statement of the financial position.
Credit-related commitments risks The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their behalf.
Such payments are collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit.
They expose the Group to similar risks to loans and these are mitigated by the same control processes and policies.
196 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 29.
Risk Management continued Credit quality per class of financial assets The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group through internal credit ratings.
The table below shows the credit quality by class of asset for loan-related lines in the statement of financial position, based on the Groups credit rating system.
It is the Groups policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio.
This facilitates focused management of the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products.
The rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Groups rating policy.
Attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined by the Group as follows: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due no more than 30 days is assessed as a financial asset with High Grade: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 30 but less than 60 days is assessed as a financial asset with Standard Grade: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 60 days or borrower of this loan has at least an additional borrowing in past due more than 60 days as at reporting date is assessed as a financial asset with Sub-Standard Grade.
Annual Report 2015 BGEO Group PLC 197 Financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29.
The Group specifically monitors performance of the loans with overdue payments in arrears for more than 90 days.
The gross carrying value i. e. carrying value before deducting any allowance for impairment of such loans comprised GEL 166,224, GEL 118,131 and GEL 123,975 as at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, respectively.
Carrying amount per class of financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated The table below shows the carrying amount for renegotiated financial assets by class.
2015 2014 2013 Loans to customers: Commercial loans 141,294 115,155 44,559 Micro and SME loans 20,890 8,734 5,147 Residential mortgage loans 28,594 3,446 9,418 Consumer loans 18,243 617 1,031 Finance lease receivables 2,684 4,957 1,533 Total 211,705 132,909 61,688 Impairment assessment The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment include whether any payments of principal or interest are overdue by any number of days or there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of counterparties, credit rating downgrades, or infringement of the original terms of the contract.
The Group addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and collectively assessed allowances.
Loans are considered to be individually impaired if they are past due by certain number of days as prescribed per the Group methodology, or history of the debt service is deteriorated by a certain percentage, as defined per the Group methodology, or any other defined event of default is identified.
Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than through a collective impairment assessment model of the Group.
198 BGEO Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Strategic report Strategic report Financial Additional Overview Strategy Performance Governance statements information 29.
Risk Management continued Individually assessed allowances For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies them between being individually impaired or not impaired.
The allowance for those individually significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired is determined through individual assessment of the associated credit risk by assigning a proper credit rating.
The allowances for nonsignificant loans that are determined to be individually impaired are also individually assessed.
The allowance for losses for individually significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through the collective assessment approach described below.
Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of the counterpartys business plan, its ability to improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts and the expected dividend payout should bankruptcy ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable value of collateral, the timing of the expected cash flows and past history of the debt service of the borrower.
Impairment losses are evaluated at each reporting date, unless unforeseen circumstances require more careful attention.
Collectively assessed allowances Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and unsecured consumer lending, commercial lending, etc.
both, significant as well as non-significant, where there is not yet objective evidence of individual impairment.
Allowances are evaluated on each reporting date with each portfolio receiving a separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though there is not yet objective evidence of the impairment in an individual assessment.
Impairment losses are estimated by taking into consideration the following information: historical losses on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the appropriate delay between the time a loss is likely to have been incurred and the time it will be identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected receipts and recoveries once impaired.
Local management is responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as long as one year, depending on the product.
The impairment allowance is then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with the Groups overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision is made in a similar manner as for loans.
Risk Management continued Liquidity risk and funding management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and stress circumstances.
To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its core deposit base, manages assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis.
This incorporates an assessment of expected cash flows and the availability of high grade collateral which could be used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption of cash flow.
The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs.
In addition, the Group maintains a cash deposit obligatory reserve with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted.
The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a standalone Bank basis, based on certain liquidity ratios established by the NBG.
As at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 these ratios were as follows: 2015, 2014, 2013, % % % Average liquidity ratio 38.1% 39.3% 42.3% Maximum liquidity ratio 48.0% 46.8% 48.1% Minimum liquidity ratio 28.9% 31.7% 35.5% The average liquidity ratio is calculated on a standalone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average arithmetic mean of daily liquidity ratios, computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of Georgia as follows: Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash.
Those assets include investment securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG and do not include amounts due from credit institutions, other than inter-bank deposits, and or debt securities of Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, amounts in nostro accounts which are under lien, impaired inter-bank deposits and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised or settled later than six months from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity subsequent to the reporting date of less than six months.
Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully collateralised by cash covers in the Bank, and commitments due to dealing operations with foreign currencies.
The maximum and minimum liquidity ratios are taken from historical data of the appropriate reporting years.
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on negative gaps compared to the Banks standalone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation.
The ratios are assessed and monitored monthly and compared against set limits.
In the case of deviations, amendment strategies actions are discussed and approved by ALCO.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.
Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately.
However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Bank could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Banks deposit retention history.
Risk Management continued The table below shows the contractual expiry by maturity of the Groups financial commitments and contingencies.
The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts.
Their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer period than indicated in the tables above.
These balances are included in amounts due in less than three months in the tables above.
Included in due to customers are term deposits of individuals.
In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay such deposits upon demand of a depositor Note 16.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices.
The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading portfolios.
Trading and non-trading positions are managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity of the consolidated income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for the year, based on the floating rate non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2015.
Changes in basis points are calculated as standard deviations of daily changes in floating rates over the last month multiplied by respective floating rates.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, year ended 31 December 2014 and year ended 31 December 2013, sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Groups equity.

The Management Board has set limits on positions by currency based on the NBG regulations.
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2015 on its trading and nontrading monetary assets and liabilities and its forecast cash flows.
The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant on the income statement due to the fair value of currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities.
The reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation of daily changes in exchange rates over the last month.
A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase.
During the year ended the year ended 31 December 2015, year ended 31 December 2014 and year ended 31 December 2013, sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Groups equity.

The Group calculates the effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments across each loan product individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective products as at the reporting date and multiplying by the weighted average effective annual interest rates for each product.
The model does not make a distinction between different reasons for repayment e. g. relocation, refinancing and renegotiation and takes into account the effect of any prepayment penalties on the Groups income.
The estimated effect of prepayment risk on net interest income of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2015, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 is as follows: Effect on net interest income 2015 19,341 2014 16,744 2013 5,944 Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events.
When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss.
The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the risks.
Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
Operating environment Most of the Groups business in concentrated in Georgia.
As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy.
Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not typically associated with those in developed markets including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, and undeveloped debt and equity markets.
However, over the last few years the Georgian government has made a number of developments that positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory systems.
This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation including new Tax Code and procedural laws.
In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia.
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist.
The future stability of the Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the Government.
However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world.

These incorporate the Groups estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Trading securities and investment securities Trading securities and a certain part of investment securities are quoted equity and debt securities.
Investment securities valued using a valuation technique or pricing models consist of unquoted equity and debt securities.
These securities are valued using models which sometimes only incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and non-observable data.
The non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the investee, its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investee operates.

Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short term maturity less than three months it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value.
This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.

Maturity Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities The table below shows an analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to when they are expected to be recovered or settled.
See Note 29 Risk management for the Groups contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.
In the Georgian marketplace, where most of the Groups business is concentrated, many short-term credits are granted with the expectation of renewing the loans at maturity.
As such, the ultimate maturity of assets may be different from the analysis presented above.
To reflect the historical stability of current accounts, the Group calculates the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years and includes the amount in the less than 1 year category in the table above.
The remaining current accounts are included in the on demand category.

Maturity Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued The Groups principal sources of liquidity are as follows: deposits: borrowings from international credit institutions: inter-bank deposit agreement: debt issues: proceeds from sale of securities: principal repayments on loans: interest income: and fees and commissions income.
These funds continue to provide a majority of the Groups funding and represent a diversified and stable source of funds.
In the Boards opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Groups present requirements.
