Bulk Ingredients adjusted operating profit decreased by 23% 19% in constant currency to 133 million 2014 172 million.
Five key factors have combined to reduce adjusted operating profit by 97 million in this financial year.
Firstly, on a constant currency basis, the adjusted operating profit of our SPLENDA Sucralose business was lower by 43 million due principally to price erosion in an extremely competitive market.
The second significant factor was the impact of the operational and supply chain disruption which led to costs totalling around 20 million in the year.
These costs exclude the impact of lost sales which constrained volume growth in Speciality Food Ingredients in the year by approximately three to four percentage points.
Thirdly, adjusted operating profit in our Bulk Ingredients business in Europe was 13 million lower than the previous financial year as pricing for EU sugar, which provides the reference price for isoglucose in Europe fell, and the 2014 financial year included a 28 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION Exceptional items from continuing Summary of financial results operations Change 1 During the year the Group recognised Restated Change constant 2015 2014 reported currency an exceptional charge of 142 million, Year ended 31 March m m % % comprising 12 million of business Continuing operations transformation costs associated with completing the implementation of the Adjusted sales 2 694 3 147 14% 11% common global IS IT system: 12 million to Adjusted operating profit 247 349 29% 27% terminate distribution rights previously held Adjusted net finance expense 23 27 by a third party to sell our crystalline fructose Adjusted profit before tax 224 322 30% 28% to customers primarily in Asia Pacific: and Exceptional items 142 14 118 million of costs associated with the Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 9 10 business re-alignment exercise announced Net retirement benefit interest 8 8 on 21 April 2015.

30 | Tate & Lyle PLC | Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USEFUL INFORMATION New supplementary disclosure framework and pro-forma adjustment for Eaststarch re-alignment To provide more details on our business performance, in addition to the segmental disclosure required under IFRS which remains unchanged, and given the evolving nature of the business including the changes announced in April, we intend to disclose additional information regarding the performance within our operating segments.
We believe the revised approach will provide a clearer understanding of the drivers of performance: better highlight the impact of commodity volatility on performance: and drive a greater understanding of the sustainable growth potential of the business.
For Speciality Food Ingredients, we will disclose our business through the major components of SPLENDA Sucralose, our full Food Systems business and the rest of the business.
For these, we will disclose volume growth as a percentage, adjusted sales in millions of pounds, and adjusted operating profit in millions.
We will provide additional information on the geographical split of the business excluding Food Systems and SPLENDA Sucralose, specifically North America, the combination of Asia Pacific and Latin America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA.
For these geographic regions we will disclose volume growth as a percentage and adjusted sales in millions.
On the same basis, to provide greater insight into the progress we are making on innovation, we will also disclose innovation-related growth within Speciality Food Ingredients.
For Bulk Ingredients, we will disclose the performance of the division as a single segment, but also provide volume growth for the key North American bulk sweetener and North American industrial starches businesses as we believe volume growth rather than sales value is the key metric for the business, with sales values being clouded by the pass through of corn costs.
We also want to give greater insight into the impact that commodities volatility has on this business.
We aim to dampen volatility in Bulk Ingredients wherever we can.
We actively do this through raw material hedging, the use of tolling contracts and decisions on forward co-product sale commitments.
As a result, for most of our business we are generally able to generate solid cash flows.
However, there are some parts of the business, mainly in ethanol and co-product pricing, where our ability to dampen volatility is limited and no viable hedging options exist.
While we expect conditions in the commodity markets will vary from year to year, for these commodities our approach will continue to be to plan for a normal year, and we will provide guidance as the year progresses on the expected impact of these commodities on the performance of Bulk Ingredients.
In the new supplementary disclosure framework information for the year ended 31 March 2015, which is presented on a pro-forma basis, Group adjusted sales and adjusted operating profit have been reduced by 101 million and 32million respectively to reflect the pro-forma impact of re-alignment of the Eaststarch European joint venture, assuming that the transaction had taken effect from 1 April 2014.

Looking forward, and to provide a direct and consistent pro-forma comparative for the year ending 31 March 2016, adjustment to the pro-forma 31 March 2015 adjusted profit before tax is required to align foreign exchange rates and to include profits for the first quarter to 30 June reflecting a modelling assumption that the Eaststarch transaction will complete on that date.
Taking 3 these items into account the adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2015 on a consistent basis becomes 208 million, having increased pro-forma profit by 7 million to align to prevailing foreign exchange rates and by adding back 8 million to reflect the first quarters results of Eaststarch.
