Cable & Wireless Communications Group is an international telecommunications service provider.
It operates integrated telecommunications companies offering mobile, broadband, video, fixed line and Managed Services and other to residential and business customers.
The Group has modified its operating segments following the disposal of Monaco which has been classified as discontinued operations note 2.8.
1 and the reclassification of Seychelles to continuing operations.
From 1 April 2014, the Board the chief operating decision marker considers the performance of BTC separately from that of LIME rest of Caribbean.
During the year the Group had four principal operations which have been identified as the Groups reportable segments, being Panama, LIME, BTC and Seychelles.
Our Business-to-Business and  operations are included in the results of the region to which they relate.
The Group also has another operating segment which is comprised of the corporate centre, operational hub, results of our subsea cable partnership and wholesale solutions business and eliminations for inter-segment transactions.
This segment does not meet the definition of a reporting segment as it earns revenue from its activities that are less than 10% of overall Group revenue.
This function primarily acts as an operational support provider for the reportable segments.
The Board considers the performance of each of these operations in assessing the performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources.
Accordingly, these are the operating segments disclosed.
There are no other operating segments identified by the Board.
The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board.

Annual Report 2014 15 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 Section two Results for the year 2.7 Deferred tax continued The US$7,339 million 31 March 2014 US$6,643 million tax losses include UK capital losses of US$5,507 million 31 March 2014 US$5,421 million.
Tax losses have not been recognised as there are insufficient taxable profits to utilise those losses in future periods.
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the Group controls the timing of remittance and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is US$47 million 31 March 2014 US$136 million.
These temporary differences relate to unremitted earnings.
2.8 Discontinued operations The following section outlines what the Group is either holding for sale or has disposed of in the year.
When the Group has assets and liabilities that are likely to be sold rather than being held for continuing use and when accounting standards require, these assets and liabilities are included in current assets and liabilities and denoted as held for sale, rather than in their usual categories.
If they represent a significant enough portion of the Group, they are also treated as discontinued operations.
This means that their trading performance is no longer reported in the income statement and are instead reported in a separate line, net of tax, called discontinued operations.
These amounts no longer form part of continuing earnings per share.
Our former Monaco Telecom business, disposed of during the year, is included in discontinued operations.
1 Monaco At a General Meeting on 15 May 2014, shareholders of the Company approved the sale of Compagnie Mongasque fide Communication SAM CMC, the holding company for the Groups 55% stake in Monaco Telecom SAM to a private investment vehicle controlled by Xavier Niel.
Monaco Telecom also owned 36.75% of Telecom Development Company Afghanistan Limited Roshan.
The sale of the business was completed on 20 May 2014 for a total consideration of US$445 million.
In addition, the Group received US$8.6 million relating to the estimated cash, debt and working capital at completion.
The disposal is a further step in CWCs strategy to focus on the Caribbean and Latin America region, and after completion of the disposal, as the Group now generates all of its revenue from the Caribbean and Latin America region, with the exception of the Seychelles.
At 31 March 2014, Monaco did not meet the definition of a disposal group held for sale nor the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as there was insufficient certainty regarding the completion of a sale process.
The results of Monaco Telecom were disclosed separately in their own operating segment.
At 31 March 2015, the Monaco business has been classified as a discontinued operation as the sale had been completed.
The comparative consolidated income statement and cash flow statement have been restated.
2 Islands The significant aspects of the Islands transaction are described below: We completed the sale of the Islands sub-group including the Groups interests in operations in the Maldives, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, South Atlantic, Diego Garcia for US$470 million on 3 April 2013.
The Group received cash proceeds of US$501 million representing consideration of US$470 million plus US$31 million of proportionate net cash in the businesses attributable to Cable & Wireless Communications: We also agreed to sell a 25% interest in Compagnie Mongasque fide Communication SAM CMC, the holding company of the Groups interests in Monaco Telecom, for US$100 million which was completed on 3 April 2013: and We also granted to Batelco a put option over the 25% of CMC shares transferred to Batelco the CMC put option, refer to note 4.6 which was recognised as a financial liability and the Group unwound the put option and repurchased the 25% CMC shareholding for US$100 million on 30 December 2013.
3 Macau At a General Meeting on 28 February 2013, the shareholders of the Group approved the sale of the Macau operating segment for US$750 million to CITIC Telecom International Holdings Limited.
This sale took place on 20 June 2013.
The Group received cash proceeds of US$807 million comprising consideration of US$750 million plus US$57 million of proportionate net cash in the business attributable to Cable & Wireless Communications.
The Macau operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation.
The results of Macau were previously recorded in the Macau operating segment.
4 Seychelles The Seychelles was disclosed as a discontinued operation and as a disposal group held for sale in the statement of financial position.
At 31 March 2014 net assets were US$47 million.
This included cash and cash equivalents of US$3 million.
At 31 March 2015 the Seychelles are presented in continuing operations as they no longer meet the definition of held for sale.
The comparative consolidated income statement and cash flow statement have been restated and reported within the Seychelles operating segment.
