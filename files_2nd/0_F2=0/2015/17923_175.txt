7 Financial Statementscontinued 27 Pension and other post-retirement obligations continued Defined benefit post-retirement medical schemes The Group operates a number of post-retirement medical schemes in the US, Canada and Europe.
During the 2015 financial year, as part of the demerger of South32, the Group transferred its defined benefit medical schemes in South Africa to South32.
Full actuarial valuations are prepared by local actuaries for all schemes.
All of the post-retirement medical schemes in the Group are unfunded.
Risk The Groups defined benefit pension schemes and post-retirement medical schemes expose the Group to a number of risks including asset value volatility, interest rate and inflation risk.
Recognising this, the Group has adopted an approach of moving away from providing defined benefit pensions.
The majority of Group sponsored defined benefit pension schemes have been closed to new entrants for many years.
Existing benefit schemes, and the terms of employee participation in these schemes, are reviewed on a regular basis.
Fund Assets The Group follows a coordinated strategy for the funding and investment of its defined benefit pension schemes subject to meeting all local requirements.
The Groups aim is for the value of defined benefit scheme assets to be maintained at close to the value of the corresponding benefit obligations, allowing for some short-term volatility.
Scheme assets are invested in a diversified range of asset classes, predominantly comprising bonds and equities.
The Groups aim is to progressively shift defined benefit pension scheme assets towards investments that match the anticipated profile of the benefit obligations, as funding levels improve, and as benefit obligations mature.
Over time, this is expected to result in a further reduction in the total exposure of pension scheme assets to equity markets.
For pension schemes that pay lifetime benefits, the Group may consider and support the purchase of annuities to back these benefit obligations if it is commercially sensible to do so.
