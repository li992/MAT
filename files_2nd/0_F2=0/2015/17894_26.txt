Financials Financials 137 137 Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments and on a going concern basis.
The Company is a public limited company, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are disclosed below.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March.
a Subsidiaries An entity is controlled by the Group regardless of the level of the Groups equity interest in the entity, when the Group has power over the entity, when it is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power to affect those returns.
In determining whether control exists, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances to assess its control over an entity such as contractual commitments and potential voting rights held by the Group if they are substantive.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date control has been transferred to the Group and fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
Where control ceases the results for the year up to the date of relinquishing control or closure are analysed as continuing or discontinued operations.
b Joint ventures and associates Associates are those entities in which the Group exercises its significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but it does not have the power to control or jointly control the entity.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
The Groups interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identified on acquisition.
The Groups share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses after tax is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its joint venture and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture and associate.
The Groups share of joint venture revenue is disclosed after elimination of sales to that joint venture.
Loans to joint ventures are valued at amortised cost.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: a Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is considered probable.
As can be seen from note 3 this represents approximately 10% of the business.
b Sale of services Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction.
The provision of services over a long-term period are accounted for under the principles of construction contracts, and the revenue recognised as set out below.
In a limited number of contracts where performance and revenue are measured annually the revenue and costs are similarly recognised over the course of the year.
c Long-term service contracts Revenue from long-term service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts.
The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific contract concerned.
Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours incurred or earned value of work performed.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Revenue continued c Long-term service contracts continued The profit element of the revenue attributable to a contract is recognised if the final outcome can be reliably assessed.
In order to assess the likely outcome of a contract a full estimated cost of completion is produced which will assess risks and opportunities including cost rates, time, volume and performance for the contract and apply a probability to these being realised.
As time elapses these risks and opportunities will become more predictable.
Risks and opportunities will vary dependent on the terms of each contract and the commercial environment of each market.
Certain contracts will have pain gain share arrangements whereby target cost under over spends are shared with the customer.
These sharing arrangements are included in assessing the overall contract outturn and the expected profit.
Any expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Exceptional items Items that are exceptional in size or nature are presented as exceptional items within the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains or losses on the disposal of properties and businesses, material acquisition costs along with the restructuring of businesses and asset impairments.
Transactions with non-controlling interest The Group policy is to treat transactions with non-controlling interest as transactions with owners of the parent and therefore result in movements in reserves.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
A provision for warranties is recognised on completed contracts and disposals when there is a realistic expectation of the Group incurring further costs.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work-in-progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and as liability provisions for the remainder.
Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are updated regularly.
A provision is made where the operating leases are deemed to be onerous.
A provision for deferred consideration on acquisitions is recognised when the Group has a realistic expectation of the expense based on the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
A provision for employee benefits is recognised when there is a realistic expectation of the liability.
Goodwill and intangible assets a Goodwill When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking exceeds the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and is capitalised.
When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking is less than the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is taken directly to the income statement.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 is maintained at its net book value on the date of transition to IFRS.
From that date goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
Annual impairment reviews are performed as outlined in note 12. b Acquired intangibles Acquired intangibles are the estimated fair value of customer relationships and brands which are in part contractual, represented by the value of the acquired order book, and in part non-contractual, represented by the risk adjusted value of future orders expected to arise from the relationships.
The carrying value of the contracted element is amortised straight-line over the remaining period of the orders that are in process or the future period in which the orders will be fulfilled, as the case may be.
The amortisation periods, reflecting the lengths of the various contracts, are mainly in the range one year to five years, with a minority of contracts and hence amortisation periods, up to fifteen years.
The carrying value of the non-contracted element is amortised over the period in which it is estimated that the relationships are likely to bring economic benefit via future orders.
The method of amortisation is tailored to the expectations of the timing of the receipt of specific future orders and therefore the charge to the income statement matches the timing of value likely to be generated in those years.
Relationships are valued on a contract by contract and customer by customer basis and the pattern of amortisation reflects the expected pattern of benefit in each case.
The amortisation profile is determined on a case-by-case basis and in all cases results in a front-loaded profile, reflecting the greater certainty of future orders in the near term compared with the longer term.
The amortisation period is in the range one year to fifteen years.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued The carrying value of the brands are amortised over the period in which it is estimated that the particular brands are likely to bring economic benefit via future orders.
The maximum amortisation period for existing acquired brands is five years.
c Research and development Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit but not exceeding seven years.
d Computer software Computer software includes software licences acquired plus the costs incurred in bringing the software into use and is shown at cost less accumulated amortisation and is amortised over its expected useful lives of between three and five years.
Property, plant and equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of PPE over the estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value reassessed at each balance sheet date at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% to 8% Leasehold property Lease term Plant and equipment 6.6% to 33.3% Aircraft airframes 3.33% Aircraft and components 14% to 33.3% PPE is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount exceeds the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell or value in use.
Net debt Net debt consists of the total of loans, bank overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents, joint venture and associate loans and finance leases granted or received plus any derivatives whose objective is to fair value hedge the underlying debt.
This will include swaps of the currency of the debt into the functional currency and interest rate basis of the company carrying the debt and fair value hedges.
Leases Assets under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding capital element of instalments is included in borrowings.
The interest element is charged against profits so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Depreciation is calculated to write the assets off over their expected useful lives or over the lease terms where these are shorter.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis.
As a lessor, the Group recognises assets held under a finance lease in the balance sheet as a financial asset.
The lease payment receivable is treated as finance income and a repayment of principal including initial direct costs.
Finance income is allocated over the lease term, with the gross receivable being reviewed for impairment on a regular basis.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in first-out method.
In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Contract accounting balances The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses.
Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset and amortised over the life of the contract when it can be reliably expected that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
Post-contract award but pre-contract operational start-up mobilisation costs are recognised as an asset and amortised over the life of the contract.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Taxation a Current income tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
b Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in either other comprehensive income or in equity.
Foreign currencies a Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the year end exchange rates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as part of the net investment of a foreign operation.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the balance sheets and income statements of foreign operations into Sterling are recognised as a separate component of equity on consolidation.
Results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated using the average exchange rate for the month of the applicable results.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period end exchange rates.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless they are attributable to an asset under construction, in which case finance costs are capitalised.
Capitalisation of applicable interest commenced in 2009 10.
Employee benefits a Pension obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The service cost and associated administration costs of the Groups pension schemes, are charged to operating profit.
In addition, a retirement benefit interest charge on the net pension deficit is charged to the Income statement as a finance cost.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity through the Statement of comprehensive income so that the Groups balance sheet reflects the fair value of the schemes surpluses or deficits at the balance sheet date.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued b Share-based compensation The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
The shares purchased by the Groups ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity.
c Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
Discontinued and held for sale A significant business stream sold in a prior year or during the year or being actively marketed with an expectation of being sold within a year will be treated as discontinued within the income statement.
The prior year comparatives will be restated.
If such a business has not been sold at year end the relevant assets and liabilities will be shown as held for sale within the balance sheet.
In addition businesses bought as part of a larger acquisition but identified for sale on purchase will be treated as discontinued.
Service concession arrangements IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements addresses the accounting by private sector operators involved in the provision of public sector infrastructure assets and services.
For all arrangements falling within the scope of the Interpretation essentially those where the infrastructure assets are not controlled by the operator, the infrastructure assets are not recognised as property, plant and equipment of the operator.
Rather, depending on the terms of the arrangement, the operator recognises: a financial asset where the operator has an unconditional right to receive a specified amount of cash or other financial asset over the life of the arrangement: or an intangible asset where the operators future cash flows are not specified e. g. where they will vary according to usage of the infrastructure asset : or both a financial asset and an intangible asset where the operators return is provided partially by a financial asset and partially by an intangible asset.
As a consequence of this treatment the operator recognises investment income in respect of the financial asset on an effective interest basis and amortisation of any intangible asset arising.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The Group designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets carrying amount.
These gains or losses are then realised through the income statement as the asset is sold.
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair values is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable in light of known circumstances.
The key areas of estimates and judgements for the Group are contract accounting and revenue recognition see above, the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes see note 26, impairment of goodwill see note 12.
Fair value adjustments on acquisitions are by nature subject to critical judgements.
The size of the Avincis acquisition makes this a significant judgement in Group terms see note 30.
Profit and revenue recognition on contracts is a key judgement exercised by management on a contract by contract basis.
In order to make such a judgement an estimate of contract outturn is made for all significant contracts.
Local management divisions and Group review and challenge estimates made.

Financial risk management The Groups treasury and capital policies in respect of the management of debt, interest rates, liquidity, and currency are outlined below.
The Groups treasury policies are kept under close review given the continuing volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets.
Capital availability The Company defines capital as shareholder equity plus net debt but in addition considers available financial capital which adds committed undrawn facilities to capital as a measure.
Objective on available To ensure an appropriate level of capital and available financial capital to maintain operational flexibility financial capital and meet financial obligations whilst funding the Groups organic and acquisitive growth.
The Group seeks to maintain the necessary headroom to cover the peaks and troughs in its working capital cycle, and sufficient liquidity to see it through any periods of tightened liquidity in the market.
Policy The Board aims to maintain a balance between equity and debt capital which optimises the Groups cost of carry whilst allowing access to both equity and debt capital markets at optimum pricing when appropriate.
The Group, in considering its capital structure and financial capital, views net debt to EBITDA at two times or below as being steady state and sustainable in the current market and against the current economic backdrop.
This is not to rule out acquisition spikes above two times, as illustrated by the recent acquisition of Babcock Mission Critical Services formerly known as Avincis or previous acquisitions in the past, but only if the Group can see a clear path to reducing net debt to EBITDA back to two times or below within a reasonable time frame.
Performance The Groups gearing and debt cover ratios, used by the Group to evaluate capital, saw an acquisition spike of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA upon completion of the acquisition of Babcock Mission Critical Services, on a 31 March 2014 proforma basis.
Actual net debt to EBITDA as at 31 March 2015 was 2.15 times, demonstrating progress in bringing gearing back towards a steady state level, both in the pay down of debt and through increasing profits attributable to shareholders.
Covenant 2015 2014 Debt service cover EBITDA net interest 4 8.3x 15.0x Debt cover Net debt EBITDA 3.5 2.15x 1.3x Gearing Net debt shareholders funds n a 56% 41% Debt ratios are below covenanted levels and gearing has reduced since the Babcock Mission Critical Services acquisition.
Current levels leave sufficient headroom for bolt-on acquisitions and funding of organic growth.
The Group believes that capital markets remain accessible, if or when required.
Financial risk management continued Financial risk management Financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities.
All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups customers are mainly from government, government backed institutions or blue chip corporations and as such credit risk is considered small.
Treasury activities within the Group are managed in accordance with the parameters set out in the treasury policies and guidelines approved by the Board.
A key principal within the treasury policy is that trading in financial instruments for the purpose of profit generation is prohibited, with all financial instruments being used solely for risk management purposes.
The Group only enters into financial instruments where it has a high level of confidence of the hedged item occurring.
Both the treasury department and the divisions have responsibility for monitoring compliance within the Group to ensure adherence with the principal treasury policies and guidelines.
The Groups treasury policies in respect of the management of debt, interest rates, liquidity, and currency are outlined below.
Management of capital The Groups capital structure is derived from equity and net debt and is overseen by the Board through the Group Finance Committee.
All the Groups material borrowings are arranged by the treasury department, and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
A range of gearing and liquidity ratios are used to monitor and measure capital structure and performance, including: Net debt to EBITDA defined as net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals, Gearing ratio defined as net debt, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, divided by shareholders funds, ROIC defined as net income divided by total capital equity, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, plus net debt and EBITDA interest cover defined as profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals divided by net interest payable.
These ratios are discussed under the business review.
Through the monitoring of these metrics it remains the Groups intention to ensure the business is prudently funded, balancing risk and price on the capital markets and to retain sufficient flexibility to fund future organic and acquisitive growth.
Foreign exchange risk The functional and presentational currency of Babcock International Group PLC and its UK subsidiaries is pounds Sterling.
The Group has exposure primarily to EUR, USD and ZAR.
The USD exposure arises firstly through the US$650 million US Private Placements which are swapped into Sterling and secondly, through a number of activities in Babcock Mission Critical Services formerly known as Avincis where it has some revenue and costs denominated in USD.
The EUR exposure is largely due to the activities of Babcock Mission Critical Services in Europe, where both translational and transactional exposure exists.
The ZAR exposure arises from the activities of Babcocks subsidiaries in South Africa where both translational and transactional exposure exist.
Objective To reduce exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the Euro, US Dollar and South African Rand.
Policy The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency Transactional risk denominated transactions.
To mitigate this risk, the Groups policy is to hedge all material transactional exposures, using financial instruments where appropriate.
Where possible, the Group seeks to apply IAS 39 hedge accounting treatment to all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency transaction exposures.
Policy The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets Translational risk and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
It is not the Groups policy to hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement or balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
Performance There have been no material unhedged foreign exchange losses in the year.
A key principle within the treasury policy is that trading in financial instruments for the purpose of profit generation is prohibited, with all financial instruments being used solely for risk management purposes.
The foreign exchange exposure of Group entities on the net monetary position against their respective functional currencies expressed in the Groups presentation currency, with the largest exposure being 18.9 million Euro to US Dollars 2014: Sterling to Canadian Dollars 1.4 million.
Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2015 144 144 Babcock International Group PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2.
Financial risk management continued Foreign exchange risk continued The pre-tax effect on profit and equity, increase or decrease, if the rates moved up or down by an appropriate percentage volatility, assuming all other variables remained constant would in total be 1.5 million 2014: 0.1 million.
The reasonable shifts in exchange rates are based on historical volatility and range from 10% for Sterling to US Dollars: 15% for Euro to Sterling and US Dollars: 25% for Sterling to Canadian and Australian Dollars: 25% for South African Rand to Euro: and 15% Sterling to Omani Rial.
Interest rate risk The fair values of debt, and related hedging instruments are affected by movements in interest rates.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity in interest rate-sensitive instruments and associated debt to a hypothetical parallel shift of the forward interest rate curves of 50bp 2014: 50bp, with pre-tax effect annualised and an additional shift in variable rates for the floating rate element of the gross debt.
All other variables are held constant.
The Group believes 50bp is an appropriate measure of volatility at this time.
2015 2014 m 50bp m 50bp m 50bp m 50bp Net results for the year 3.6 3.6 1.6 1.6 Equity 10.5 10.5 11.1 11.1 Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, each being reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the appropriate mix is maintained.
Objective To manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt to reflect the underlying nature of its commitments and obligations.
As a result, the Group does not maintain a specific set proportion of fixed versus floating debt, but monitors the mix to ensure that it is compatible with its business requirements and capital structure.
Policy Interest hedging and the monitoring of the mix between fixed and floating rates is the responsibility of the treasury department, and are subject to the policy and guidelines set by the Board.
Performance As at 31 March 2015, the Group had 55% fixed rate debt March 2014: 49% and 45% floating rate debt March 2014: 51% based on gross debt including derivatives of 1,507.9 million March 2014: 670.6 million.
For further information see note 22 to the Group accounts.
Liquidity risk The key objectives are to ensure that the Group has an appropriate balance between continuity, flexibility and cost of debt funding through the use of borrowings, whilst also diversifying the sources of these borrowings with a range of maturities and rates of interest, to reflect the long-term nature of the Groups contracts and commitments and its risk profile.
Liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines see note 21.
The Groups committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 750 million has an expiry date of December 2019 with options to extend a further one year, plus one year, and is available to meet general corporate funding requirements.
At 31 March 2015, 395.8 million was drawn on this facility.
The Group has US Private Placements with a value of US$650 million, with notes maturing in March 2018 and March 2021.
The Group has two Sterling loan notes with a value of 100 million, with notes maturing in January 2017 and January 2020.
Each of the business divisions in the Group provides regular cash forecasts for both management and liquidity purposes.
These cash forecasts are used to monitor and identify the liquidity requirements of the Group, and ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on the Groups committed borrowing facilities.
The cash performance of the business divisions is a KPI.
Financial risk management continued The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of its surplus cash.
It is deposited with strong financial institutions for short periods, with bank counterparty credit risk being monitored closely on a systematic and ongoing basis.
A credit limit is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation and credit rating.
Objective With debt as a key component of available capital, the Group seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between continuity, flexibility and cost of debt funding through the use of borrowings, whilst also diversifying the sources of these borrowings with a range of maturities and rates of interest, to reflect the long-term nature of the Groups contracts and commitments and its risk profile.
Policy All the Groups material borrowings are arranged by the treasury department, and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
It remains the Groups policy to ensure the business is prudently funded and that sufficient headroom is maintained on its facilities to fund its future growth.
Performance The Group continues to keep under review its capital structure to ensure that the sources, tenor and availability of finance are sufficient to meet its stated objective.
During the course of the financial year, the Group refinanced and increased its Revolving Credit Facility from 500 million to 750 million, with the new facility being signed December 2014.
In addition, the Group issued a debut eight year EUR 550 million Eurobond in October 2014.
These new facilities, together with the other existing committed facilities provide sufficient sources of liquidity and headroom to meet the Groups ongoing commitments.
In addition to the afore mentioned Revolving Credit Facility and Eurobond, the Groups other main debt facilities include: 100 million of loan notes issued in January 2010, US$650 million US private placement notes issued in March 2011.
These debt facilities provides the Group with total available committed banking facilities and loan notes of 1.65 billion.
For further information see note 21 to the Group accounts.
The table below analyses the Groups liabilities that will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contract maturity date.

The reclassification relates to assets that should be included within plant and equipment.
Acquired intangibles are in part the estimated fair value of customer relationships which are in part contractual, represented by the value of the acquired order book, and in part non-contractual, represented by the risk adjusted value of future orders expected to arise from the relationships.
Relationships are valued on a contract-by-contract and customer-by-customer basis and the pattern of amortisation reflects the expected pattern of benefit in each case.
Acquired brand names are valued dependent on the characteristics of the market in which they operate and the likely value a third party would place on them.
Useful lives are likewise dependent on market characteristics of the acquired business brand.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis up to five years.

The rights issue was effected through a structure which involved Babcock International Group PLC subscribing for shares in Axeman Jersey Limited.
Axeman Jersey Limited subsequently redeemed its redeemable preference shares for cash.
Following the receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of the net proceeds received over the nominal value of the share capital issued has been transferred to Other Reserves.
Share capital continued Potential issues of ordinary shares The table below shows options and conditional share awards existing over the Companys shares as at 31 March 2015 that are capable of being met on exercise or vesting by the issue of new shares.

The Company decides from time to time whether to satisfy the awards by way of a fresh issue of shares either to the award holder or to the employee share trust or by way of financing the employee share trusts to purchase already-issued shares in the market.
This decision is made according to available headroom within the dilution limits contained in the relevant share plan rules and what the Directors consider to be in the best interest of the Company at the time.
Award issued without matching shares, has two year vesting period.

The Company elected to pay dividends to the Babcock Employee Share Trust at the rate of 0.001p per share during the year, though full dividends were paid in respect of shares held by the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust.
The Company meets the operating expenses of the Trusts.
The Trusts enable shares in the Company to be held or purchased and made available to employees through the exercise of rights or pursuant to awards made under the Companys employee share schemes.
The Trusts are discretionary settlements for the benefit of employees within the Group.
The Company is excluded from benefiting under them.
They are controlled and managed outside the UK and each has a single corporate trustee which is an independent trustee services organisation.
The right to remove and appoint the trustees rests ultimately with the Company.
The trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust is required to waive both voting rights and dividends payable on any share in the Company in excess of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the Company, but the trustee of the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust does not have the power to waive dividends due on Babcock ordinary shares and therefore receives the full amount of any dividends declared.
Share-based payments The charge to the income statement has been based on the assumptions below and is based on the binomial model as adjusted, allowing for a closed form numerical-integrated solution, which makes it analogous to the Monte Carlo simulations, including performance conditions.
The detailed description of the plans below is included within the Remuneration report.
During the year the total charge relating to employee share-based payment plans was 15.4 million 2014: 12.2 million all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the income statement charge was 12.2million 2014: 9.4 million.
The holders of all awards receive dividends, except for CSOP awards.
The DBMP Matching awards are split evenly between the performance criteria of TSR, EPS and ROCE, whilst the PSP and CSOP awards are split evenly between TSR and EPS.
There are no performance conditions attached to the DBP.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last one to three years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The Group also operates the Babcock Employee Share Plan which allows employees to contribute up to 150 per month to the fund, which then purchases shares on the open market on the employees behalf.
The Group provides matching shares, purchased on the open market, of one share for every 10 purchased by the employee.
During the year the Group bought 45,104 matching shares 2014: 6,909 matching shares at a cost of 0.5 million 2014: 0.1 million.

Retirement benefits and liabilities continued The Group has a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal schemes are those in the UK where the Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes for employees in the Devonport Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme, the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme and the Rosyth Royal Dockyard Pension Scheme the Principal schemes.
The nature of these schemes is that the employees contribute to the schemes with the employer paying the balance of the cost required.
The contributions required and the assessment of the assets and the liabilities that have accrued to members and any deficit recovery payments required are agreed by the Group with the trustees who are advised by an independent, qualified actuary.
The key risks in all of the defined benefit schemes relate primarily to longevity, the expected inflation rate in the future which impacts on pension increases and indirectly salary increases and the discount rate used to value the liabilities.
The Principal schemes have mitigated some of these risks by taking out longevity swaps for the pensioners and their spouses and through a common investment committee have significantly hedged the interest rate and inflation risk though derivative instruments.
The Group also participates in the Babcock Rail Ltd Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme the Railways scheme.
This scheme is a multi-employer shared cost scheme with the contributions required and the assessment of the assets and the liabilities that have accrued to members and any deficit recovery payments agreed with the trustees who are advised by an independent, qualified actuary.
The costs are shared such that the employees contribute 40% of the cost of providing the benefits and the employer contributes 60%.
The Groups share of the assets and liabilities is separately identified to those of other employers in the scheme and therefore the Group cannot be held liable for the obligations of other entities that participate in this scheme.
The schemes are funded by payments to legally separate trustee-administered funds.
The trustees of each scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of each schemes members.
In addition to determining future contribution requirements with the agreement of the Group, the trustees are responsible for setting the schemes investment strategy subject to consultation with the Group.
All the schemes have an independent trustee and member nominated trustees.
The schemes are subject to regulation under the funding regime set out in Part III of the Pensions Act 2004.
The detail of the latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme is as follows.
Valuations of the Devonport Royal Dockyard scheme and the Railways scheme are currently being undertaken: Babcock Rail Ltd Devonport Babcock Rosyth section of the Royal Dockyard International Royal Dockyard Railways Pension Scheme Group Scheme Scheme Scheme Date of last formal completed actuarial valuation 31 03 11 01 04 13 31 03 12 31 12 10 Number of active members at above date 3,328 1,827 943 481 Actuarial valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Results of formal actuarial valuation: Value of assets 977.0m 1,051.0m 470.0m 189.0m Level of funding 90% 89% 83% 101% The Group also participates in or provides a number of other smaller pension schemes including a number of sections of the local government pension schemes which in most cases the employer contribution rates are fully reimbursed by the administering authorities.
It also participates in the Magnox Electric Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme and runs the Babcock Naval Services Pension Scheme for which the MoD fully reimburses the contributions payable.
The Groups cash contribution rates payable to the schemes are as follows: Babcock Rail Babcock Ltd section of Devonport International Rosyth Royal the Railways Royal Dockyard Group Dockyard Pension Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Other Total m m m m m m Future service contribution rate 19.1% 22.0% 16.6% 18.0% Future service cash contributions 19.0m 10.8m 5.2m 1.7m 9.3m 46.0m Deficit contributions 13.5m 6.0m 8.7m 2.3m 30.5m Longevity swap payments 1.8m 1.4m 1.8m 5.0m Expected employer cash costs for 2015 16 34.3m 18.2m 15.7m 1.7m 11.6m 81.5m Where salary sacrifice arrangements are in place, the Group effectively meets the members contributions.
The above level of funding is expected to continue until the next actuarial valuation of each scheme: valuations are carried out every three years.

Retirement benefits and liabilities continued The changes to the Group balance sheet at March 2015 and the charges to the Group income statement for the year to March 2016, if the assumptions were sensitised by the amounts below, would be: Defined benefit Income obligations statement 2015 2016 m m Initial assumptions 4,106.6 55.9 Discount rate assumptions increased by 0.5% 317.0 16.5 Discount rate assumptions decreased by 0.5% 317.0 13.1 Inflation rate assumptions increased by 0.5% 192.8 9.2 Inflation rate assumptions decreased by 0.5% 175.6 8.1 Total life expectancy increased by half a year 54.7 2.5 Total life expectancy decreased by half a year 54.7 2.2 Salary increase assumptions increased by 0.5% 50.2 3.6 Salary increase assumptions decreased by 0.5% 49.8 3.2 The figures in the table above have been calculated on an approximate basis, using information about the expected future benefit payments out of the schemes.
The analysis above may not be representative of actual changes to the position since changes in assumptions are unlikely to happen in isolation.
The change in inflation rates is assumed to affect the assumed rate of RPI inflation, CPI inflation and future pension increases by an equal amount.
The fair value of the schemes assets including reimbursement rights are assumed not to be affected by any sensitivity changes shown and so the balance sheet values would increase or decrease by the same amount as the change in the defined benefit obligations.
