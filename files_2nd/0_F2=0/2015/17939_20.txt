Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information a Overview Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom Registration number 05145685.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, NN8 1LT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and Directors Reports.
b Basis of accounting In accordance with EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU as at 27 March 2015 adopted IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c Basis of consolidation On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in a share-for-share transaction.
Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital.
As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings plc changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March.
Following the transaction, the Companys continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Giant Topco Limited.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control.
Accordingly, the combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i. e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
In July 2012, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited Makro.
The transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval and, whilst this process was in progress, the investment was held as an available for sale financial asset and cash subsequently advanced from Makro was shown within creditors.
Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received from the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro has been consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.
See notes 9 and 13 for more details.
62 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements d Accounting standards adopted in the period The Group has adopted the following new standards: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The Group has adopted the following amendments and interpretations: IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Improvements to IFRS 2013 IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for Non Financial Assets Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted have not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
e New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
The following have not been adopted early by the Group: Effective for accounting periods starting on or after IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 28 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 The application of these standards and interpretations is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Groups financial statements.
f Going concern The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed.
In particular, the Groups performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions.
Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
In July 2011, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of 120m for a period of 5 years.
A new facility is expected to be negotiated in the near future, in advance of the facility ending in July 2016.
At the period end, the Group had net cash of 147m and during the year to 27 March 2015, the Group did not draw on this facility.
In addition, the Group complied with all its covenants during the year.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements.
63 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
General information continued g Use of assumptions and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for: IAS37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading.
Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do so.
Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant if any for the period up until the point it is judged that the lease will no longer be onerous.
In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties and the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties.
The Directors believe that their estimates, which are based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate.
Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations.
Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in note 19.
In testing for impairment of goodwill and other assets, the Directors have made certain assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into perpetuity.
Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
At 27 March 2015, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired.
Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in note 11.
In applying the Groups accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are required to make assumptions regarding the Groups ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely quantum and timing of future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident that the Groups future profits will utilise historical tax assets.
Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Intangible assets a Business combinations and goodwill Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
64 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b Other intangibles Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years and charged to administrative expenses.
Revenue Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax.
Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned.
Provision is made for expected customer returns.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets.
Employee benefits a Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
b Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The defined benefit obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs.
In respect of actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006 the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Under IAS 19 2011, the Group determines the net interest expense income for the period on the net defined benefit liability asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
c Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided.
An accrual is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
65 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
c Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d Interest-bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Costs associated with extending the bank facility have been recognised in the income statement.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Guarantees Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These are measured and recognised at fair value.
These property guarantees are included within Provisions on the balance sheet.
66 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Impairment The carrying values of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any impairment.
In performing the impairment reviews, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or the replacement cost and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing location less supplier volume rebates.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity method of accounting.
The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities post tax profit or loss within the income statement and its share of the net assets within investments.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
Leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term.
The total amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge relative to the lease payments change.
The excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within Accruals and deferred income.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the CEO.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation in IFRS 8 are met.
These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics: similar nature of products and services: similar type or class of customers: similar methods used to distribute products or provide services: and similar regulatory environments.
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways for example by customer and product types, by delivery channels and between Booker Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, Classic Drinks, Ritter-Courivaud and Makro.
However, none of these possible segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and distribution channels, and there are a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets liabilities that are not specific.
It is therefore not possible to analyse, and the CODM does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the same way in which turnover is analysed.
Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CODM focus on the operations of the Group as a whole and report the results and financial position on an IFRS basis.
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the possible segments, which in any event would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS 8, separately in these financial statements.
67 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the Extra business centre conversions have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years remaining on the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 30 years Leasehold improvements lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years Plant and equipment 320 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Share based payments The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in a separate share option reserve.
This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, taking into account service conditions and market performance.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Supplier rebates A number of different types of rebate are negotiated with suppliers in connection with the purchase of goods for resale.
Such rebates are only recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning the rebate have been discharged, and the rebate can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract.
These rebates are recognised as a credit within cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory.
There are two main types of supplier rebates: a Terms, which are generally annual agreements not always coterminous with the Groups year end, are signed by the Group and the supplier.
Rebates are determined relative to volumes purchased or by other conditional arrangements as follows: Volume based rebates include overriders, advertising allowances and targeted income.
Rebates are accrued based on the Groups purchasing volumes and the current agreement with the supplier.
Amounts are recognised once confirmation of agreement to that rebate has been received from the supplier.
Non-volume based rebates include marketing support, range promotion and product development.
Amounts are recognised when the rebate is earned through the completion of any required obligations and confirmed by suppliers.
Invoices are issued to suppliers periodically, quarterly or annually, depending on the terms of the agreement.
68 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements b Promotional funding, which relates to price investments by suppliers through promotional activity.
The calculation of funding is mechanical and based on a formula agreed in advance of each promotion with the supplier.
Funding is recognised in the Income Statement as units are sold and is invoiced throughout the year, shortly after each promotion has ended.
Amounts relating to supplier rebates appear in a number of different balance sheet headings at the year end: Inventories: Where the rebate earned relates to inventories which are held by the Group at year end, the rebates are deducted from the cost of those inventories.
Trade receivables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding at the period end where the Group has no legal right to offset against trade payables.
Trade payables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding when the Group has a legal right to offset against payables.
Prepayments and accrued income: amounts due from suppliers in relation to supplier rebates which has been recognised but not yet invoiced.
Accruals and deferred income: amounts received in relation to supplier rebates that have not been earned at the year end.
Taxation Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity, or to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets excluding goodwill and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Segmental reporting The Group has considered the principles of IFRS 8 as well as its internal reporting, management and operating structure.
The Directors conclusion is that the Group has a single reportable segment, that of wholesaling activities.
Other than the operation in India which is immaterial, all of the Groups revenue originates from the UK.
The functional currency of the Indian operation is Rupees.
The Group has no significant reliance on any individual customers.

72 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements 9. Business combination In July 2012, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited which had two subsidiaries: Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service Wholesalers Limited Makro.
The transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval.
Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.
Through Booker and Makro coming together, the Group seeks to become the UKs leading wholesaler to caterers, retailers and small businesses by: combining the best ranges from Makro and Booker to improve overall choice: consolidating buying volumes to improve prices for customers: improving service due to an increased capacity for delivery: and improving availability by integrating the supply chain.

The fair value of the consideration is based upon the fair value of the investment held in Makro prior to the date of consolidation.
The investment was measured at fair value in accordance with IAS39 as it was an available for sale financial asset.
The fair value was initially determined by reference to the consideration transferred as set out below at completion, and the subsequent fair value was considered to be unchanged at both 29 March 2013 and 19 April 2013 and therefore there was no valuation gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income.
The subsequent investment fair value was measured by reference to the performance of Makro compared to expectations and the underlying market value of the assets of the business, predominantly properties.
Consideration for purchase of investment comprised of: m Issue of 156,621,525 new ordinary shares determined by reference to the share price of Booker Group plc at the date of completion, taking into account a discount to reflect the restrictions preventing the shares from being sold for one year after the date of completion 124.2 Cash consideration 15.8 Cash paid to reflect a targeted cash and working capital position as at 30 June 2012 4.9 144.9 The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was higher than the fair value of consideration paid, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of 11.2m, which was included in exceptional items.
The Directors considered whether this indicated inappropriate fair values underlying the acquisition accounting and concluded that all the fair values were reasonable.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the hindsight adjustment period for the acquisition of Makro Holding Limited and its subsidiaries ended on 19 April 2014.
There have been no further changes to the fair value of the consideration or the net assets acquired.

Provenance Too Limited has no other assets or liabilities and the entire consideration has been classified as know-how, since the Group has acquired expertise in the sourcing and supply of Fruit and vegetables.
Goodwill arose in the Group from the following: the acquisition of the Big Food Group Limited by Giant Topco Limited in 2005: and the acquisition of Ritter-Courivaud Limited in 2010.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to test its fixed assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.
Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and tangible fixed assets contained in each cash generating unit CGU with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre tax cash flow projections of each CGU based on the Groups approved budget for 2016 and plan for 2017.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2014: 2%, being the Directors estimated view of the long term compound growth in the economy.
This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long term business.
The discount rate used reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also takes into account the cost of debt.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with their expectations of the market.
The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together with the Directors estimations of its market share and competitive pressures.
Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities.
Expenses are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.

Intangible assets continued The Directors believe that three CGUs exist within the Group: a Ritter intangible assets of 12.5m and tangible assets of 0.8m A pre tax discount rate of 9.7% 2014: 10.4% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
With all other assumptions held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require an impairment to be made.
b Makro tangible assets of 130.3m A pre tax discount rate of 9.7% 2014: 10.4% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
With all other assumptions held constant, neither a 5% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 5% into perpetuity, would require an impairment to be made.
c Remaining business intangible assets of 427.3m and tangible assets of 75.5m A pre tax discount rate of 9.7% 2014: 10.5% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
The Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of intangible and tangible fixed assets is supported are reasonable and that no impairment to fixed assets is required.

Other investments 2015 2014 m m At start of period 144.9 Consolidated as a subsidiary from 19 April 2013 see note 9 144.9 At end of period In July 2012, the Group acquired Makro Holding Limited from Metro AG in exchange for 156,621,525 new ordinary shares and a cash consideration of 15.8m.
Makro Holding Limited had two subsidiaries: Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service Wholesalers Limited.
This was held as an investment at 29 March 2013, while the transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval and, whilst this process was in progress, the Group was required to hold Makro separate from the rest of Booker in accordance with undertakings given to the competition authorities in the normal way.
As a result, the Group had neither control nor significant influence over Makro at the 2013 year end, and therefore it did not meet the requirements for consolidation as set out in IFRS3 revised Business Combinations and IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
In accordance with IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the investment was initially held as an available for sale financial asset.
Full clearance to the transaction was received by the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.

Liquidity risk The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements.
The revolving credit facility bears floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25%.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any drawn facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.

The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual interest payments and the adjustment for non cash items including unamortised borrowing costs.
The undiscounted cash flows for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the balance sheet.
There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature.
80 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Credit risk The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group has an accounting policy to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially drawn for a small part of the year.
Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account i. e. share capital and retained earnings.
The Group has 147.0m of net cash as at 27 March 2015 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Groups Indian operation which are denominated in rupees.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does not hold any foreign exchange contracts.

Post employment benefits The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees.
Defined contribution schemes Pension contributions of 5.3m 2014: 5.0m were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period.
Included within accruals is 0.4m 2014: 0.4m of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Booker Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded pension arrangement based on final salary and was closed to new entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002.
However, active members benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by independent fund managers appointed by the Trustees.
The benefit obligations as at 27 March 2015 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS 19 basis using the results of the 31 March 2013 triennial actuarial valuation which has then been updated to 27 March 2015.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method.
a Major assumptions used by the actuary 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.40% 4.45% RPI inflation 2.95% 3.20% CPI inflation 1.95% 2.20% Rate of increase in salaries 1.95% 3.20% Pension increases in payment 2.90% 3.15% For pension increases in payment, the most significant assumption is for increases which are linked to RPI inflation capped at 6% each year.
This assumption is disclosed in the table above.
The average life expectancy in years of a member is as follows: 2015 2014 Aged 65 retiring immediately current pensioner Male 21.5 21.5 Female 23.7 23.7 Aged 40 retiring at 65 future pensioner Male 22.7 22.7 Female 25.1 25.1 At 27 March 2015, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years.

Post employment benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued g Sensitivities Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate, RPI inflation, pension increases, and life expectancy.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period of reasonably possible changes in these assumptions, which have been determined in isolation whilst holding all other assumptions constant: Life expectancy for current and future pensioners - 1 year Increase decrease in liabilities by 22m Discount rate - 0.1% Decrease increase in liabilities by 10m RPI inflation rate - 0.1% Increase decrease in liabilities by 8m Pension increases in payment - 0.1% Increase decrease in liabilities by 5m Changes in RPI inflation impact pension increases both before retirement and in payment.
h Contributions to be paid The Trustees have completed their 31 March 2013 triennial valuation of the Scheme, at which time they assessed the funding position to be a shortfall of approximately 24m.
This shortfall was expected to be recovered through Company deficit contributions 9.6m paid into the Scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014 and 2.4m paid into the Scheme in the year ending 31 March 2015 and the returns achievable on the assets of the Scheme.
No further contributions to the Scheme are expected to be made until the funding position is reviewed following the next actuarial valuation of Scheme, which is scheduled for 31 March 2016.

Property provisions are discounted at 7.0% 2014: 7.0%, being the long term expected yield for the Groups leased properties and are expected to be utilised over the terms of the leases, with approximately 3.0m expected to be utilised in the year to March 2016.
