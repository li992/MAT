It also requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Note 1.20 gives further details relating to the Groups critical accounting estimates.
At the date of approval, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yeteffective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2015: f IFRS 9 Financial Instruments classification of financial assets and financial liabilities f Amendments to IFRS 11 accounting for acquisition of interests in joint operations f Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation f IFRS 15 revenue from contracts with customers f Amendments to IAS 27 equity method in separate financial statements f Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture f Improvements 2014 annual improvements to IFRSs: 20122014 f Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IFRS 28 investment entities: Applying the consolidation exception f Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative The Group is currently in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 15 revenue from contracts with customers.
All other standards identified above are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the policies set out in the Groups Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2014.
No new or revised accounting standards were adopted in the period.
1.3 Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Zoopla Property Group Plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries together, the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company: f has the power over the investee: f is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee: and f has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries sold are included up to the effective date of disposal.
During the year the Group acquired Ulysses Enterprises and its subsidiaries together uSwitch.
The results of uSwitch have been consolidated from the date of acquisition, being 1 June 2015.
Details of the acquisition are set out in Note 14.
In June 2014 the Group was subject to restructuring prior to Admission on the London Stock Exchange.
Zoopla Property Group Plc was inserted at the top of the Group as the new parent company, with the former parent, ZPG Limited formerly Zoopla Property Group Limited, becoming a direct subsidiary of Zoopla Property Group Plc through a share-for-share exchange.
The Groups Annual Report 2014 provides further details on the basis ofconsolidation.
2014 balances are stated as though the transactions occurred within Zoopla Property Group Plc.
1.4 Going concern The financial position of the Group shows a positive net asset position and the Group continues to generate both positive Adjusted EBITDA and profit after tax.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the historical financial information.

Accounting policies continued 1.5 Revenue Revenue represents amounts due for services provided during the period, net of value added tax VAT, with the VAT liability being recognised atthedate of invoice.
The Group categorises revenue into two broad categories Property Services and Comparison Services.
The main sources of Property Services revenue are subscriptions from estate agents UK Agency revenue and developers New Homes revenue, inrespect of properties advertised on the Groups websites.
Revenue is recognised over the period of the subscription.
Revenue from other propertyservices Other Property Services revenue is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
The main sources of Comparison Services revenue are fees received for gas and electricity comparison services Energy revenue and mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone comparison services Communications revenue.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which a transaction on the Groups website completes based on the historical conversion of such transactions into completed switches.
Revenue from other comparison services Other Comparison Services revenue is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
1.6 Operating leases Leases are classified as operating leases as substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group.
The total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.7 Finance income and costs Finance income represents interest receivable on cash and deposit balances.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Finance costs represent interest and certain fees charged on bank loans, the Groups revolving credit facility, overdraft balances and other borrowings.
Finance costs are recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost.
As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items.
The corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Subsequent costs to repair or service a previously recognised item of property, plant and equipment are expensed when incurred as they do not provide future economic benefit to the organisation.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful economic lives, using the straight-line method, onthe following bases: Fixtures and fittings over 2 to 5 years Computer equipment over 2 to 5 years Leasehold improvements over the lease term The Directors review the residual values and useful economic lives of assets on an annual basis.
1.9 Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group inexchange for control of the acquiree, net of cash acquired.
Acquisition related costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value on the acquisition date with the exception of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Identifiable net assets include the recognition ofany separately identifiable intangible assets.
Further detail of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognised on the acquisition of uSwitch can befound in Note 14.
Deferred and contingent consideration are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Where the amounts payable are classified as a financial liability any subsequent change in the fair value is charged credited to the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts classified as equity are not subsequently remeasured.
Where consideration is contingent on the continued employment of Management the amount is recognised as a remuneration expense over the deferral period.
1.10 Goodwill Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever the Directors have an indication that it might be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Zoopla Property Group Plc Annual Report 2015 71 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.11 Intangible assets Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged totheconsolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as follows: Brand 10 years Domain names 5 years Databases 310 years Customer relationships 5 years Website development and computer software 3 years 1.12 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit towhich the asset belongs is estimated.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate ofitsrecoverable amount, but so that this increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined hadnoimpairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income.
1.13 Research and development The Group incurs expenditure on research and development in order to develop and improve new and existing property websites and products.
Expenditure includes the staff costs of the technical team.
Research expenditure on planning new websites or products and obtaining new technical knowledge is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are expensed when incurred unless they meet certain criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs whereby research findings are applied to creating a substantially enhanced website or new product are only capitalised once the technical feasibility and the commercial viability of the project has been demonstrated and they can be reliably measured.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Once the new website or product is available for use, subsequent expenditure to maintain the website or product, or on small enhancements to the website or product, is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
1.14 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are designated as loans and receivables.
They are recognised at amortised cost, which is net of any allowance for impairment in relation to irrecoverable amounts.
This is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historical payment profiles and past default experience.
When a trade receivable is deemed uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
The Group receives interest income on certain amounts held in escrow.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are designated as other financial liabilities.
They are recognised at their carrying amount, whichisdeemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost, net of arrangement fees.
Arrangement fees are released through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income under the effective interest method, along with interest charged, over the life of the instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are classified as equity instruments and are recognised at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Companys own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes.
1.15 Current tax Current income tax, including UK income tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
72 Helping consumers make smarter decisions Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.16 Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: f the initial recognition of goodwill: f the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and f investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax assets are recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: f the same taxable Group company: or f different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
1.17 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted to present value where the impact is material.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised in finance costs.
Dilapidation provisions are recognised based on Managements best estimate of costs to make good the Groups leasehold properties at the end ofthe lease term.
The Group recognises a restructuring provision when there is a detailed formal plan in place and when it has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring, either by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.
The provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring and not those associated with the ongoing activities of the Group.
1.18 Employee benefits: defined contribution benefit scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions payable to the fund are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period to which they relate.
1.19 Share-based payments The Group provides equity-settled share-based incentive plans whereby Zoopla Property Group Plc grants shares or nil-cost options over its shares to employees of its subsidiaries for their employment services.
The Group also issues warrants over shares in Zoopla Property Group Plc to a number of the Groups estate agent partners, allowing them to acquire shares in exchange for making their property listings available for inclusion on the Groups property websites.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and partners are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value is measured using a suitable valuation model, including the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo valuation models where appropriate, and is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are set out in Note 23.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Within the Company accounts of Zoopla Property Group Plc equity-settled share options granted directly to employees or estate agent partners of a subsidiary are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary.
The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share-based payments charge for the period and is recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding credit to equity.
A number of shares are held in trust in order to settle future exercises of the Groups share incentive schemes.
Details of the trusts are included in Note 23.
Shares held in trust are treated as a deduction from equity.
Employers National Insurance Contributions are accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%.
The amount accrued is based on the market value ofthe shares at 30 September 2015 after deducting the exercise price of the share option.
Zoopla Property Group Plc Annual Report 2015 73 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.20 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The Groups Management makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within future periods are discussed below.
Acquisition of uSwitch On 1 June 2015 the Group completed its acquisition of uSwitch.
The process of determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is inherently judgemental and there is a risk that inappropriate methodologies or assumptions could lead to the valuation of acquired intangibles, goodwill or the fair value of other net assets acquired being misstated.
The acquisition also included an element of contingent consideration in the form of a 0.030.0 million earn-out payable to both institutional and management shareholders.
The process of determining the fair value of contingent consideration payable to institutional investors was subject to Managements best estimate of the final pay-out at the date of acquisition.
The earn-out payable to management shareholders continuing in employment is recognised in the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period of deferral and this accrual is updated each period to reflect Managements best estimate of the final pay-out.
At the date of acquisition Management expected to settle the earn-out in full.
This assumption is unchanged as at the date of this report.
Management is therefore comfortable that the liability on the consolidated statement of financial position asat 30 September2015 remains appropriate.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles The Group holds goodwill and intangibles on the statement of financial position in respect of business acquisitions made.
During the period the Group has recognised intangible assets and goodwill of 181 million in respect of the acquisition of uSwitch.
Acquired intangibles include acquired brands, domain names, websites and supporting technology platforms and customer relationships.
The Group is required to review these assets for impairment.
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of impairment of intangible assets should be recorded requires an estimation of the recoverable value, which represents the higher of fair value and value in use, of the relevant cash-generating unit.
The value in use calculation requires Management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, discounted using asuitable discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred.
A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
Details of the assumptions used are included in Note 15 to the financial statements.
Revenue and accrued income Revenue generated by the Groups Comparison Services division is recognised predominantly from online switching services.
Revenue accruals are made based on an estimation of the likely number of successful switches.
Revenue recognition, including the existence of revenue, is considered to be a significant judgement area due to the estimates required to determine accrued revenue at the period end.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which a transaction on the Groups website is completed.
An element of Management judgement is required in calculating a revenue accrual which estimates the number of successful switches for each provider in the period between the last date of billing and the latest provider data being made available.
The accrued income is estimated by considering the volume of transactions that have passed from the Groups websites, the historical conversion of such transactions into completed switches and contracted revenue per switch.
Revenue from Property Services is predominantly subscription based and therefore there is a lower amount of estimation uncertainty and Management judgement involved in its recognition and measurement.
1.21 Non-GAAP performance measures In the analysis of the Groups financial performance certain information disclosed in the financial statements may be prepared on a non-GAAP basis orhas been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by Management.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures provide a more appropriate measure of the Groups underlying business performance.
The non-GAAP measures are designed to increase comparability of the Groups financial performance year-on-year.
However, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP measures adopted by other companies.
Thekey non-GAAP measures presented by the Group are: f Adjusted EBITDA which is defined as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items Note 3 : and f Adjusted basic EPS which is defined as profit for the year, excluding exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on the acquisition of uSwitch, adjusted for tax, and divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue for the period Note 11.
74 Helping consumers make smarter decisions Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 2. Business and geographical segments The Board of Directors has been identified as the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The monthly reporting pack provided to the Board to enable assessment of the performance of the business has been used as the basis for determining the Groups operating segments.
Whilst the chief operating decision maker monitors the performance of the business at a revenue and Adjusted EBITDA level Note 3, depreciation andamortisation, share-based payments, exceptional items, finance income and costs and income tax are all monitored on a centralised basis.
AstheGroup continues to evolve and the earn-out period ends we will assess the relevance of splitting out Adjusted EBITDA for the Property Services and Comparison Services divisions.
Assets and liabilities are also managed on a centralised basis and are not reported to the chief operating decision maker in a disaggregated format.
The chief operating decision maker monitors six individual revenue streams as set out below.
The six revenue streams are grouped under two headings: Property Services and Comparison Services.
Adjusted EBITDA is monitored on an aggregated basis under these two headings.
The Comparison Services division commenced on completion of the acquisition of uSwitch on 1 June 2015.
Revenue and costs shown under this heading therefore represent trading for the four months from 1 June 2015 to 30 September 2015, being the period of consolidation.
Property Services f UK Agency revenue, which represents property advertising services provided to estate agents and lettings agents: f New Homes revenue, which represents property advertising services provided to new home developers: and f Other Property Services revenue, which predominantly represents overseas property advertising services, display advertising and data services.
Comparison Services f Energy revenue, which represents gas and electricity switching services: f Communications revenue, which represents mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone switching services: and f Other Comparison Services revenue, which predominantly represents financial services switching, boiler cover, business energy and data insightservices.
All material revenues are generated from within the UK.

Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is used by Management as a key measure to monitor the Groups business and the Directors believe it should be disclosed on the face of the statement of comprehensive income to assist in the understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
Furthermore, the terms of the Groups revolving credit facility require Management to report on the Groups Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio.
Adjusted EBITDA is therefore considered a key performance metric for Management, the providers of the Groups external debt and other stakeholders.
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items.
Exceptional items include costs and profits which Management believes to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence.
Such items would include costs associated with business combinations, one-off gains and losses on disposal, and similar items of a non-recurring nature together with reorganisation costs and similar charges.
In 2015 exceptional items relate to the acquisition of uSwitch as set out below.
Exceptional items in 2014 were incurred in relation to the Groups IPO.
This is further adjusted for share-based payment expenses which are comprised of charges relating to: i warrants issued to certain of the Groups partners: and ii employee incentive plans which are aimed at retaining staff and aligning employee objectives with those of the Group.
The Directors consider that excluding share-based payments and other non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortisation in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA gives a more appropriate measure of the Groups underlying financial performance and a closer approximation to the Groups operating cash flows.
The table below presents a reconciliation of profit for the period to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown: 2015 2014 000 000 Operating profit 34,562 28,467 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 415 153 Amortisation of intangible assets arising on the acquisition of uSwitch 2,047 Amortisation of other intangible assets 1,610 1,505 Share-based payments Note 23 1,873 3,910 Exceptional items 8,187 5,579 Adjusted EBITDA 48,694 39,614 76 Helping consumers make smarter decisions Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 3.

A reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% was effective from 1 April 2014.
A further reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% was effective from 1 April 2015.
The reduced rate of 20% has also been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax as it was substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
On 8 July 2015 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020.
The Finance Bill was not substantively enacted at the year end date and therefore the one-off impact of re-measuring the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities for the rate change is not recognised at 30 September 2015.

Acquisitions On 1 June 2015 Zoopla Property Group Plc completed its acquisition of uSwitch through the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital ofUlyssesEnterprises Limited for total consideration of 177.6 million as measured in accordance with IFRS 3.
Expenses incurred on the acquisition of 5.1 million are included within administration expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Thesecosts have been considered exceptional in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 Note 3.
The purchase has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3.
In calculating the goodwillarising on acquisition the fair value of net assets acquired of 6.7 million was assessed and no material adjustments from book value were made.
The Group has recognised a number of separately identifiable intangibles as part of the acquisition, details of which are set out in Note 14a.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired were as follows: Fair value 000 Property, plant and equipment 777 Intangible assets computer software 86 Trade receivables 5,466 Accrued income 10,056 Prepayments and other receivables 953 Deferred tax assets 379 Trade payables 3,079 Accruals and other payables 6,708 Provisions 135 Corporation tax payable 1,053 Total net assets acquired 6,742 Intangible assets recognised Note 14a : Brand 48,770 Website and technology platform 2,890 Database 900 Deferred tax liability arising on intangibles 10,512 Goodwill on acquisition Note 14b 128,782 177,572 Satisfied by: Cash consideration, net of cash acquired 61,907 Debt assumed and discharged Note 14c 79,675 Deferred and contingent consideration Note 14d 35,990 Total consideration 177,572 The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of 16.5 million and a gross contractual value of16.5 million.

Zoopla Property Group Plc Annual Report 2015 83 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14.
Intangible assets recognised on consolidation Brand 48.8 million has been recognised in respect of the uSwitch brand name, domain name, image and reputation.
The brand has been valued using an excess earnings valuation model using profit generated from organic sources over a useful economic life of 10 years.
Organic sources include direct visits to the website and traffic achieved through unpaid search results.
Management believes profit generated from organic sources represents the best estimate of the value brought to the Group by the uSwitch brand.
A post-tax discount rate of 12% and an average long-term growth rate of 6% have been used to determine the net present value of future profits in excess of a reasonable return on other contributory assets.
Website and technology platform 2.9 million has been recognised with respect to the uSwitch website and supporting technology platforms.
The fair value has been obtained by estimating the cost of independently building a similar website and supporting platforms.
The asset will be depreciated over a useful economic life ofthree years.
Database uSwitchs consumer database helps the business to drive traffic and revenue through targeted email campaigns.
The value of the database has been determined at 0.9 million based on a discounted cash flow of profit from email campaigns over the 12 months to 31 May 2015 extrapolated over a useful economic life of three years.
A 20% churn rate has been applied to the forecast to account for natural churn in the information held.
Goodwill The acquisition of uSwitch provides a number of benefits to the Group.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition represents value arising from intangible assets that are not separately identifiable under IAS 38 including the skills and knowledge of uSwitchs workforce and expected revenue and cost synergies as outlined below.
The Board believes that the integration of the Comparison Services division into the Group will help create a fully integrated consumer property journey with an enhanced product and service offering which will increase consumer engagement on the Groups platform and drive an increase in the quantity and quality ofleads provided to existing property professional partners and advertisers.
The Board also believes that comparison services are highly relevant to the Groups consumer audience and that this will provide substantial cross-selling opportunities.
By offering additional products and services along the consumer property journey the Board expects to drive increased demand for comparison services, generating additional revenues as well as reducing the direct costs associated with generating additional leads.
Furthermore, the Board believes that there are further revenue opportunities within uSwitch as the home services comparison market continues to grow and there is additional scope for uSwitch to increase and expand its product offering in the financial services comparison market.
Debt assumed and discharged Immediately prior to acquisition uSwitch had outstanding debt of 87.0 million.
This amount was fully settled on acquisition.
79.7 million ofthe outstanding debt was assumed and discharged by Zoopla Property Group Plc.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the amounts included in the consolidated statement of cash flows: 2015 2014 000 000 Cash consideration, net of cash acquired on acquisition 61,907 Debt assumed and discharged 79,675 Cash expenses incurred on acquisition 4,430 Deferred consideration paid 1,497 Cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries 146,012 1,497 14d.

Deferred and contingent consideration continued i Deferred consideration Deferred consideration of 11.0 million has been recognised at acquisition.
Deferred consideration is payable in cash and or up to 10.0 million in shares of Zoopla Property Group Plc at the discretion of the Group.
The amount has been classified as a financial liability on the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the acquisition date in accordance with IAS 39. ii Contingent consideration earn-out Earn-out consideration of between 0.0 and 30.0 million is payable in cash or up to 50% in shares of Zoopla Property Group Plc at the discretion of the Group.
The amount to be paid is contingent on the performance of uSwitch against certain revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets over a 16 month period to 30 April 2016.
Up to 5.0 million of the earn-out is payable to Management shareholders, the treatment for which is set out below.
The remaining 0.0 to 25.0 million has been recognised at fair value on the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the acquisition date.
Management expects to settle the earn-out in full and therefore a liability for the full 25.0 million has been recognised.
Any subsequent movements inthe fair value will be recognised within the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a fair value gain or loss.
Consideration payable to Management shareholders A maximum of 11.4 million is payable to Management shareholders and is conditional on the continued employment of Management up to and including the date of payment.
In accordance with IFRS 3, this consideration will be recognised as a remuneration expense in the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the deferral period.
The Group is accruing the full 11.4 million over the deferral period.
The movement in the value of deferred and contingent consideration between the date of acquisition and 30 September 2015 is set out in Note 18.
An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are based on the value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by Management covering a three year period.
They reflect Managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
A growth rate of 3% has been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity.
Growth has been capped at 3% across both business units soasnot to exceed the long-term expected growth rate of the country and industry the Group operates in, in accordance with IAS 36.
The pre-tax discount rate used for both businesses is 12%.
The Directors are comfortable that a reasonable change in the underlying assumptions would not indicate an impairment.

Financial instruments Carrying amount and fair value of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, are designated as Loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
All financial liabilities are classified as Other liabilities measured at amortised cost.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded atamortised cost in the financial statements are approximate to their fair values.
Financial risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments: f credit risk: f market risk: and f liquidity risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or bank counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of each period was equal to the carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements.
The exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The potential for customer default varies between the Groups two revenue divisions.
The customer base of the Groups Property Services division islarge, so there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Comparison Services division operates in a market with a small number of customers, which creates a concentration of debtor balances, and from time to time the amounts due from one or a number of suppliers may be material.
However, customers within this market are often large energy and telecommunications organisations with high credit ratings and access to significant funds.
TheGroups largest customer contributed to 19% of the Groups trade receivables balance.
The Group manages counterparty risk on its trade receivables through strict credit control quality measures and regular aged debt monitoring procedures.
The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although it does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances.
Overdue amounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary.

Financial instruments continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the income and financial management of the Group.
The Group isnot exposed to any significant currency risk and there is a minimal interest rate risk on cash and bank balances.
However, the Group has borrowings subject to an interest rate calculated with reference to Libor.
Changes in interest rates therefore impact the financial results of the Group.
The Directors actively monitor interest rate risk and note that interest rates remain at a historical low.
The Directors believe that any reasonable increase in the Libor rate would not significantly impact the Group.
Therefore, the Group does not hedge its interest rate risk at this time.
At 30 September 2015 borrowings of114.0 million were subject to floating interest rates 2014: nil.
At 30 September 2015 if Libor were to have increased by 1% throughout the year with all other variables held constant profit before tax would decrease by 0.4 million 2014: nil as a result of additional interest incurred.
Therefore, the Directors are comfortable that any sensitivity to fluctuations in interest or exchange rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the ability of the Group to meet the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash as they fall due.
Management regularly reviews performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient cash funds are available to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups activities are highly cash generative allowing it to effectively service working capital requirements.
At 30 September 2015 the Group held total cash and cash equivalents of 19.2 million 2014: 30.1 million and Net Debt of 93.2 million.
The Group has access to a 150.0 million revolving credit facility RCF, of which 114.0 million was drawn-down at 30 September 2015.
The remaining 36.0 million undrawn facility allows the Group to secure additional external financing should it be required.
The total facility requires the Group to meet certain covenants based on the Groups interest cover and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio.
Exceeding the covenants would result in the Group being in breach of the facility, which may lead to the facility being withdrawn.
Management regularly monitors and models covenant compliance and prepares detailed forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available.
The Directors are satisfied that there is reasonable headroom on each ofthe Groups debt covenant ratios.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturities for undiscounted financial liabilities, including interest.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to settle.
Where interest rates are variable the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at 30 September 2015.

Treasury and capital risk management The Groups policy is to actively manage its cash and capital structure to ensure that it complies with its current debt covenant ratios, maintains its current dividend policy and minimises the Groups interest payments by paying down its debt where possible.
Management will consider the use of excess cash, including the payment of special dividends to shareholders and M&A activity, based on the risks and opportunities of the Group at that time.
The Directors can manage the Groups capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity instruments and by adjustment totheGroups dividend paid to equity holders.
The Directors believe that the current debt to equity ratio remains appropriate but continue to monitor the efficiency of the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
