This exposes the Company to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Company.
The main risks arising from the Companys pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and gearing risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the financial statements relate.
The Companys exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Companys investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Companys operations.
Derivative transactions which the Company enters into may include equity or index options, index future contracts, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks, foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from the Companys investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.

i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Company faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 40 to 44.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Companys accounting policies as stated in Note 2 f. At the year end, the Companys portfolio included no derivative instruments 30 April 2014: no derivative instruments.
Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Market price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30 April on its quoted and unquoted investments was as follows: 30 April 2015 30 April 2014 000 000 Non-current asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 770,353 584,799 770,353 584,799 An analysis of the Companys portfolio is shown on pages 38 to 40.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2014:15% in the fair values of the Companys investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys investments at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and may make use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.
Foreign currency exposure The table below shows, by currency, the split of the Companys non-sterling monetary assets, liabilities and investments that are priced in currencies other than sterling.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the loss after tax for the year and the value of shareholders funds in regard to the financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won and Taiwan Dollar.
Based on the year end position, if Sterling had depreciated, by a further 10%, against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2015 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 402 24 25 5 24 110 Capital return 69,220 3,294 3,346 2,143 2,399 3,660 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 69,622 3,318 3,371 2,148 2,423 3,770 Change to shareholders funds 69,622 3,318 3,371 2,148 2,423 3,770 30 April 2014 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 369 30 11 2 16 62 Capital return 50,460 2,662 2,600 1,074 2,510 3,222 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 50,829 2,692 2,611 1,076 2,526 3,284 Change to shareholders funds 50,829 2,692 2,611 1,076 2,526 3,284 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2015 108 Based on the year end position, if Sterling had appreciated, by a further 10%, against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: 30 April 2015 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 329 20 21 4 19 90 Capital return 56,634 2,695 2,737 1,754 1,963 2,995 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 56,963 2,715 2,758 1,758 1,982 3,085 Change to shareholders funds 56,963 2,715 2,758 1,758 1,982 3,085 30 April 2014 000 Hong US Kong Korean Taiwan Dollar Euro Yen Dollar Won Dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 302 25 11 2 13 52 Capital return 41,286 2,178 2,127 878 2,054 2,636 Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 41,588 2,203 2,138 880 2,067 2,688 Change to shareholders funds 41,588 2,203 2,138 880 2,067 2,688 In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.

All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Company finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Company uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Company may also enter into interest rate swap agreements.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at 30 April, of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates i. e. giving cash flow interest rate risk when the rate is due to be re-set: fixed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

The table below illustrates the Companys sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Companys financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2015 30 April 2014 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 51 80 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 51 80 Change to shareholders funds 51 80 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time.
b b L Li iq qu ui id di it ty R y Ri is sk k Liquidity risk is the possibility of failure of the Company to realise sufficient assets to meet its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which may be sold to meet funding requirements as necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure The maturity of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in note 18 to the financial statements.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
At 30 April the financial liabilities comprised of: 30 April 2015 30 April 2014 000 000 Due within 1 month: Balances due to brokers 10,165 15,793 Accruals 2,109 1,850 Due after 3 months and within 1 year: Bank loan 13,631 22,938 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2015 111 55 F Fi in nan anc cial ial S St ta at tem emen ent ts s Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 30 April 2015 29 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued c c C Cr re ed di it R t Ri is sk k Credit risk is the exposure to loss from failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.
Management of the risk The Company manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers and by dealing through Polar Capital.
All cash balances are held with approved counterparties.
HSBC Bank plc is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from HSBCs own trading assets and are therefore protected in the event that HSBC were to cease trading.
These arrangements were in place throughout the current year and the prior year.
Credit risk exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2015 was 48,344,000 30 April 2014: 62,154,000 comprising: 30 April 2015 30 April 2014 000 000 Balances due from brokers 14,233 6,851 Accrued income 296 353 Cash at bank 33,815 54,950 48,344 62,154 All of the above financial assets are current, their fair values are considered to be the same as the values shown and the likelihood of a material credit default is considered low.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
All deposits were placed with banks that had a rating of A or higher.
Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, the credit standing of each is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.

When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in note 18.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the financial statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.

The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys fixed rate loan facility and ii t he need to issue or buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price i. e. the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.

The Company is also subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the loan covenants set out in the loan facility.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.
