DAB Deferred Annual Bonus Plan.
a Since 2010, vesting of the deferred shares has been subject to a safety and environmental sustainability hurdle, and this will continue.
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all.
In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the SEEAC.
There is no identified minimum vesting threshold level.
b Bob Dudley and Dr Byron Grote received awards in the form of ADSs.
The above numbers reflect calculated equivalents in ordinary shares.
One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
c Represents vestings of shares made at the end of the relevant performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested.
The market price of each share used to determine the total value at vesting on the vesting dates of 15 January 2015, 11 February 2015 and 9 February 2016 were 3.93, 4.46 and 3.34 respectively and for ADSs on 11 February 2015 and 9 February 2016 were $40.35 and $28.95 respectively.
d The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 12 February 2014 of 4.87. e The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 11 February 2015 was 4.46 and for ADSs was $40.35.
The sterling value has been used to calculate the face value.
f Dr Brian Gilvary was granted the shares under the DAB prior to his appointment as a director.
The vesting of these shares is not subject to further performance conditions and he receives deferred shares at each scrip payment date as part of his election choice.
g All matching shares have been pro-rated to reflect actual service during the performance period and these figures have been used to calculate the face value.
Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.
There is no identified overall minimum vesting threshold level but to comply with UK regulations a value of 44.4%, which is conditional on the TSR, operating cash flow and each of the strategic imperatives reaching the minimum threshold, has been calculated.
The market price of each share at the vesting date of 7 May 2015 was 4.57 and for ADSs was $41.83.
For the assumed vestings dated May 2016 a price of 3.72 per ordinary share and $33.81 per ADS has been used.
These are the average prices from the fourth quarter of 2015. d The 2012-2014 award vested on 7 May 2015, which resulted in an increase in value at vesting of 297,110 for Iain Conn and $193,922 for Byron Grote.
Details for Bob Dudley and Brian Gilvary can be found in the single figure table on page 77. e The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 12 February 2014 was 4.87 and for ADSs was $48.38, and on 11 February 2015 was 4.46 and for ADSs was $40.35.
