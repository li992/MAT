COM 129 Notes to the accounts continued 3: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The factors used to determine the Groups reportable segments are the geographic locations, UK and France, and sectors in which it operates, which are generally managed by separate teams and are the basis on which performance is assessed and resources allocated.
Gross rental income represents the Groups revenue from its tenants and customers.
Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the performance of each sector.
Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets between segments.
As stated in the Financial Review on page 53, management reviews the business principally on a proportionally consolidated basis, except for its interests in premium outlets held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, where the Group has less day-to-day involvement in the financial performance and which have different operational characteristics compared with the Groups property portfolio.
The segmental analysis has been prepared on the basis that management uses to review the business, rather than on a statutory basis.
Property interests represent the Groups non-wholly owned properties which management proportionally consolidate when reviewing the performance of the business.
For reconciliation purposes the Reported Group figures, being wholly-owned properties, are shown in the following tables.
During the year, the Group acquired an interest in a loan portfolio secured on retail properties located in Ireland in a 50% joint venture.
The loans did not generate any rental income in 2015, and at the balance sheet date the loan portfolio was included within current receivables on a proportionally consolidated basis, and is therefore not included in notes 3A and 3B.
Note 3C includes the Groups investment in the new Irish joint venture at 31 December 2015.

Summaries of the valuers reports are available on the Companys website: www.
As noted in Significant judgements and key estimates on page 124, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely publicly available and involve a degree of judgement.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs to the valuations, some of which are unobservable as defined by IFRS 13, include capitalisation yields nominal equivalent yield and market rental income ERV.
These inputs to the valuations are analysed by segment in the valuation and rental data tables on pages 166 and 169 and the valuation change analysis in the Financial Review on page 58.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst increases in capitalisation yields and discount rates would result in a fall in values and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the impact on valuation.
The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions.
For example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.

COM 149 Notes to the accounts continued 20: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED C: Foreign currency management continued To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in euro-denominated entities, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro-denominated bonds, senior notes USPP, bank loans and currency swaps, as net investment hedges.
This designation allows exchange differences on hedging instruments to be recognised directly in equity and offset the exchange differences on net investments in euro-denominated entities also recognised in equity.
The notional and carrying amount of these euro-denominated liabilities is shown below.

The euro notional is the amount due at maturity without netting any receivable of different currency under the same instrument.
The carrying amount is the book value at which euro denominated financial instruments are recognised within borrowings.
The fair value of euro-denominated bonds at 31 December 2015 was 767.6 million 2014: 829.8 million.
D: Profit and loss account and balance sheet management The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on pages 53 to 61.
E: Cash management and liquidity Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity while maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longerterm liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 20A.
F: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits, balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable, participative loans to associates and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The credit risk on balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable and participative loans is limited as they are supported by investment properties held within the joint ventures and associates.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate, as set out in note 15.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in the Additional Disclosures section on page 168.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The credit risk on restricted monetary assets, being cash held by the Group and its managing agents on behalf of third parties, is similarly considered low.
At 31 December 2015, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 335.8 million 2014: 243.5 million which excludes those balances supported by investment properties.
