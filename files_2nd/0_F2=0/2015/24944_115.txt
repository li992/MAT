12 Trading assets Accounting policy Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of shortterm profit-taking.
They are recognised on trade date, when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties, and are normally derecognised when sold.
They are initially measured at fair value, with transaction costs taken to the income statement.
Subsequent changes in their fair values and interest are recognised in the income statement in Net trading income.
