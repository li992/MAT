NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 A: ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting Although the consolidated Group accounts are prepared under IFRS, the Hammerson plc company accounts presented in this section are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The prior year financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and have been restated for material adjustments on adoption of FRS101 in the current year.
The last financial statements under a previous GAAP UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the date of transition to FRS101 was therefore 1 January 2014.
There has been no movement in total equity due to the change in accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS101.
Movements in equity are detailed within the statement of changes in equity on page 159.
Previously under UK GAAP the Companys derivatives were held at fair value and the investments in subsidiary companies and other related undertakings at valuation.
Consequently there has been no effect on the balance sheet as a result of the change in accounting framework.
The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except that the investments in subsidiary companies and other related undertakings are included at valuation.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the goods and services.
Disclosure exemptions adopted In preparing these financial statements Hammerson plc has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS101.
Therefore these financial statements do not include: certain comparative information as otherwise required by EU endorsed IFRS: certain disclosures regarding the Companys capital: a statement of cash flows: certain disclosures in respect of financial instruments: the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted: and disclosure of related party transactions with wholly-owned members of the Group.
The above disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated Group accounts into which Hammerson plc is consolidated.
Accounting policies The significant judgements and key estimates and accounting policies relevant to the Company are the same as those set out in the accounting policies for the Group in note 1, except for investments in subsidiary companies and other related undertakings which are included at valuation.
The Directors determine the valuations with reference to the underlying net assets of the entities, which consist primarily of investment properties.
In calculating the underlying net asset values, no deduction is made for deferred tax relating to revaluation surpluses on investment properties.
The investment properties are valued by professionally qualified external valuers.
Further details are set out in note 11 to the consolidated accounts.
