About Us Strategic Report Governance Accounts Other Information 01 03 04 33 34 68 69 99 100 112 79 Notes to the Accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Board regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position for its entire operations, which are entirely based in its country of domicile, the UK, and receives financial information for the UK as a whole.
As a consequence the Group has one reportable segment which is UK housebuilding.
As there continues to be only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are measured and reported on a basis consistent with the Group financial statements, no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Chief Executives Operating Review on pages 20 to 23.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations as a whole when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation of resources.

5 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
On 22 May 2015 the Group sold its remaining shared interest assets note 14 for cash consideration of 32.462 million.
This resulted in a profit on disposal of 6.865 million.
This has been treated as an exceptional item.
There were no exceptional items in the year ended 31 July 2014.

A further reduction to 20%, effective from 1 April 2015, has further reduced the Groups current tax charge.
The deferred tax assets held by the Group at the start of the comparative year that were expected to be realised after 31 March 2015 were valued at the substantively enacted tax rate that will be effective when they are expected to be realised, 20%.
A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from April 2017 and to 18% from April 2020 has been announced, but neither were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, so these changes are not reflected in these financial statements.
The effective income tax expense is 20.1% of profit before taxation 2014 22.2% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 20.7% 2014 22.3%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to enhanced tax deductions received by the Group in relation to land remediation relief and employers pension contributions made during the year.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.

A formal internal valuation of investment properties was carried out at the end of the financial year.
The fair value of the investment properties was assessed at 1.991 million 2014 7.450 million.
Investment properties are held at cost and categorised as level 3 within the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised as defined within the standard.
The fair value is calculated on the same basis as other financial assets see notes 14 and 18.

In each case their principal activity is related to housebuilding.
The Group is made up of 57 subsidiaries and 7 joint arrangements.
Further details are included in note 27.
Where Bellway owns 100% of the voting rights of a business, the company is considered to be controlled by Bellway and is treated as a subsidiary.
North Solihull Partnership LP, Cramlington Developments Limited and Leebell Developments Limited are classified as joint operations as the shareholders have substantially all of the economic benefit of the assets and fund the liabilities of the entities.
Barking Riverside Limited and Ponton Road LLP are classified as joint ventures as the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangements rather than the individual assets and liabilities.

Land with a carrying value of 83.2 million 2014 66.4 million was used as security for land payables note 17.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.

On 22 May 2015 the Group sold its remaining interest in shared equity assets note 5.
Other financial assets previously comprised loans, largely with non fixed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets were recorded at fair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of significant unobservable inputs including future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisited the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
At 31 July 2014 the estimated fair value of these assets included an allowance for low single-digit price inflation.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value was charged over the estimated deferred term to cost of sales, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
The imputed interest credited to cost of sales for the year ended 31 July 2015 was 0.131 million 2014 0.156 million.
Credit risk, which the directors considered to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, was used in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 July 2014, and at the same date none of the other financial assets were past their due dates.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reflects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors considered at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reflects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash flows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the initial market discount rate and the market discount rate at 31 July 2014 and the market discount rate at 22 May 2015, the date of disposal, and accordingly have not recognised any movements directly within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Company has no other financial assets.

indd 87 29 10 2015 17:35 88 Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables, other financial assets and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash, other receivables and amounts owed by Group undertakings.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through reinvested profits, bank borrowings, cash in hand and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of certain employee share options.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments held during the year have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and housing market risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 15.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and reinvested profit and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
The Groups banking arrangements outlined in the Report of the Directors are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held see note 17.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on LIBOR.
For the year ended 31 July 2015 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by 1.399 million 2014 restated increase profit before taxation by 0.109 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the creditor is initially recorded at fair value, being the price paid for the land discounted to present day, and subsequently at amortised cost.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expense, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.

25 Employee benefits a R etirement benefit obligations The Group sponsors the Bellway plc 1972 Pension Scheme the Scheme which has a funded defined benefit arrangement which is closed to new members and to future service accrual.
The Group also sponsors the Bellway plc 2008 Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan GSIPP which is a defined contribution contract-based arrangement.
Contributions of 3.889 million 2014 2.858 million were charged to the income statement for the GSIPP.
Defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.
Role of Trustees The Scheme is managed by the Trustees, who are appointed by either the Company or the members.
The role of the Trustees is to manage the Scheme in line with the Scheme trust deed and rules, to act prudently, responsibly and honestly, impartially and in the interests of all beneficiaries.
The main responsibilities of the Trustees are to agree with the employer the level of contributions to the Scheme and to make sure these are paid, to decide how the Schemes assets are invested so the Scheme is able to meet its liabilities, and to oversee that the payment of benefits, record keeping and administration of the Scheme complies with the Scheme trust deed and rules and legislation.
Funding UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 July 2014 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2015.
With regard to the Scheme, regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year were 0.77 million 20141.20 million.
The employer also paid special contributions amounting to 3.20 million 2014 1.32 million.
Expenses were paid in addition.
The Group is expected to make regular contributions of 1.21 million during the year ending 31 July 2016.

Risk The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant are: Risk Description Asset volatility The Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
However, a significant proportion of the Schemes assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities, that would be expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term but create volatility and risk in the short-term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, with higherinflation increasing the liabilities.
However, there are caps of either a 3% p. a. or 5% p. a. increase in place to limit the effect of higher inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes liabilities are to provide a pension for the life of the member, withanyincrease in life expectancy also increasing the Schemes defined benefit obligation.

Actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date: 2015 2014 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 3.60 4.20 Future salary increases 3.90 3.90 Allowance for pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p. a. if less 3.40 3.40 Allowance for deferred pension increases of CPI or 5% p. a. if less 2.40 2.40 Allowance for commutation of pension for cash at retirement 50% of maximum 50% of maximum The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 July 2015 are based on the S2PxA tables and allow for future improvement in mortality.
The tables used imply the following life expectancies at age 65: Male retiring at age 65 in 2015 23.5 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2015 25.6 years Male retiring at age 65 in 2035 25.6 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2035 27.9 years Sensitivities The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises the effect on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if different assumptions were used: Assumption Change in assumption Change in liabilities % Discount rate -0.25% p. a.
Increase by 4.2% Future salary increases 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 0.3% Inflation RPI 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 3.7% Mortality 1 year life expectancy Increase by 2.8% The calculations for the sensitivity analysis are not as accurate as a full valuation carried out using these assumptions.
Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.

Awards under the LTIP and SMP have been made to executive directors, the Group Company Secretary, and senior employees, with awards under the DBP also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under these schemes.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP and the SMP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 54 to 57 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Various small share option awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level, under the term of the DBP.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 normally for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share-based payments is as follows: LTIP, SMP and DBP 2015 2014 Number of Number of options options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 294,402 251,219 Granted during the year 117,458 114,812 Lapsed during the year 37,489 71,629 Exercised during the year 70,627 Outstanding at the end of the year 303,744 294,402 Exercisable at the end of the year The options outstanding at 31 July 2015 have a weighted average contractual life of 1.5 years 2014 1.5 years.

indd 95 29 10 2015 17:35 96 Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 25 Employee benefits continued b Share-based payments continued Valuation methodology For LTIP and SMP options granted after 24 October 2011 half of the performance criteria is based on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplified Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Groups TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the DBP, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled inamore sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
