CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives in managing capital are: To ensure that the Group has sufficient capital to meet its operational requirements and strategic objectives To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk To ensure that sufficient regulatory capital is available to meet any externally imposed requirements The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk, availability and cost.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets, having particular regard to the relative costs and availability of debt and equity finance at any given time.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, issue or redeem other capital instruments, such as retail or corporate bonds, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Following the authorisation of Paragon Bank by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA, the Group became subject to regulatory capital rules on a consolidated basis.
This is discussed further below.
a Dividend cover Following its rights issue in 2008 the Group pursued a progressive dividend policy with the dividend being increased from 3.0p in respect of that year to 4.0p in respect of the year ended 30 September 2011.
In 2012 as a result of the progress of the business, the directors adopted a new policy under which the dividends will increase so that, by the year ending 30 September 2016, the level of dividend cover will be maintained in the range 3.0 to 3.5 times.
The most common measure of dividend cover used by financial analysts is based on earnings and dividend per share.
The Group has confirmed that its dividend cover target will be based on this calculation.
The expected level of dividend cover on this basis in respect of the year, subject to the approval of the final dividend at the Annual General Meeting, is shown below.
Note 2015 2014 22 Earnings per share p 35.5 31.9 45 Proposed dividend per share in respect of the year p 11.0 9.0 Dividend cover times 3.2 3.5 In previous years an alternative measure of dividend cover has been used.
This differs from the above measure due to the effect of share buy-backs and therefore it is additionally presented below, for completeness.
Note 2015 2014 Profit after tax for the year m 107.1 97.2 45 Proposed dividend in respect of the year m 32.6 27.4 Dividend cover times 3.3 3.5 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 159 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS b Return on tangible equity Return on tangible equity ROTE is a measure of an entitys profitability used by investors.
ROTE is defined by the Group by comparing the profit after tax for the year, adjusted for amortisation charged on intangible assets, to the average of the opening and closing equity positions, excluding intangible assets and goodwill.
The Groups consolidated ROTE for the year ended 30 September 2015 is derived as follows: Note 2015 2014 m m Profit for the year 107.1 97.2 Amortisation of intangible assets 13 1.4 1.3 Adjusted profit 108.5 98.5 Divided by Opening equity 947.1 873.3 Opening intangible assets 24 7.9 8.5 Opening tangible equity 939.2 864.8 Closing equity 969.5 947.1 24 Closing intangible assets 7.7 7.9 Closing tangible equity 961.8 939.2 Average tangible equity 950.5 902.0 Return on Tangible Equity 11.4% 10.9% In previous years the Group has disclosed return on equity ROE, calculated by the Group by comparing the profit after tax for the year to the average of the opening and closing equity positions, but it is considered that ROTE is a more widely used measure.
There is no significant difference in the values of ROE and ROTE for either of the years shown.
PAGE 160 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS c Gearing The Board of Directors regularly review the proportion of working capital represented by debt and equity.
Net debt is calculated as total debt, other than securitised and warehouse debt, valued at principal value, less free cash up to a maximum of the total debt.
Adjusted equity comprises all components of equity share capital, share premium, minority interest, retained earnings, and revaluation surplus other than amounts recognised in equity relating to cash flow hedges.
The debt and equity amounts at 30 September 2015 and at 30 September 2014 were as follows: Note 2015 2014 m m Debt Corporate bond 50 110.0 110.0 50 Retail bonds 297.5 185.0 48 Bank overdraft 0.7 1.1 38 Less: Applicable free cash 199.9 177.3 Net debt 208.3 118.8 Equity Total equity 969.5 947.1 43 Less: cash flow hedging reserve 1.9 0.6 Adjusted equity 971.4 946.5 Total working capital 1,179.7 1,065.3 Debt 17.7% 11.2% Equity 82.3% 88.8% Total working capital 100.0% 100.0% The movements in the proportion of working capital represented by debt and equity during the year ended 30 September 2015 resulted primarily from the operation of the policy described above.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 161 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Accounts THE ACCOUNTS d Regulatory capital The Group is subject to supervision by the PRA on a consolidated basis, as a group containing an authorised bank.
As part of this supervision the regulator will issue individual capital guidance setting an amount of regulatory capital, defined under the international Basel III rules, implemented through the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive CRD IV, which the Group is required to hold relative to its risk weighted assets in order to safeguard depositors against the risk of losses being incurred by the Group.
The Groups regulatory capital is monitored by the Board of Directors and the Asset and Liability Committee, who ensure that appropriate action is taken to ensure compliance with the regulators requirements.
The future regulatory capital requirement is also considered as part of the Groups forecasting and strategic planning process.
At 30 September 2015 the Groups regulatory capital of 976.3m 2014: 981.1m was comfortably in excess of that required by the regulator.
The Groups regulatory capital differs from its equity as certain adjustments are required by the regulator.
A reconciliation of the Groups equity to its regulatory capital determined in accordance with CRD IV at 30 September 2015 is set out below.
Note 2015 2014 m m Total equity 969.5 947.1 Deductions 45 Proposed final dividend 21.8 18.3 24 Intangible assets 7.7 7.9 Deferred tax adjustment 0.3 0.5 Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital 939.7 920.4 Other tier 1 capital - - Total Tier 1 capital 939.7 920.4 50 Corporate bond 110.0 110.0 Less: amortisation adjustment 75.8 53.8 34.2 56.2 Collectively assessed credit impairment allowances 2.4 4.5 Total Tier 2 capital 36.6 60.7 Total regulatory capital 976.3 981.1 Deferred tax assets in subsidiary companies are required to be deducted from regulatory capital.
This balance is offset against the deferred tax liability in the consolidated accounts.
When tier 2 capital instruments have less than five years to maturity the amount eligible as regulatory capital reduces by 20% per annum.
As the Groups 110.0m Corporate Bond matures in 2017, this adjustment is required.
PAGE 162 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Accounts Annual Report & Accounts 2015 THE ACCOUNTS The total exposure amount calculated under the CRD IV framework against which this capital is held, and the proportion of these assets it represents, are calculated as shown below.
