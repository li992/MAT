FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED SECTION 3: ASSET MANAGEMENT The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures.
The performance of the property portfolio whether wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives EPRA net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in four groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups EPRA NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Investment property under development fixed assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Investment property on completion.
iii Completed properties current assets These are assets acquired by the Group with the intention to hold the assets for a short period prior to disposal to a joint venture or third parties.
The Group continues to earn rental income and capital appreciation on these assets which are held at cost in the balance sheet.
iv Properties under development current assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Completed properties on completion.
These assets are held at cost in the balance sheet.

Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value.
Completed properties, properties under development and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 6.4% 2014: 5.6%.
The valuation of property assets involves significant judgement and changes to the core assumptions market conditions, rental income, occupancy and property management costs could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets.
Valuation process Valuations of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors, were the valuers in the years ending 31 December 2015 and 2014.
The valuations are based on both: Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of leases and nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc.
This information is derived from the Groups financial systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment.
Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers the assumptions are typically market related, such as yield and discount rates.
These are based on their professional judgement and market observation The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers are reviewed by the Property Board and the CFO.
This includes a review of the fair value movements over the year.

Completed property and property under development fair value measurements are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and their fair value is measured using the same techniques as for investment properties and investment properties under development.

Where the asset is leased to a University, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the markets general perception of the lessees credit worthiness.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual market transactions.
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the discounted cash flow method less estimated costs to completion.

There are interrelationships between these rates as they are partially determined by market rate conditions.
