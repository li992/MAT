NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts recognised in the financial statements and disclosure of contingent liabilities.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
There have been no significant judgements, estimates or assumptions for the current or preceding financial year.
