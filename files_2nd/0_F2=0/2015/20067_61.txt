Notes to the consolidated financial statements 101 24.
Financial instruments and risk management Risk management is performed by BT Group plc, the ultimate parent company.
The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements and the groups exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the BT Group plc Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of the borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated its authority to operate these policies to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director BT Group plc.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk profile between 31 March 2015 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy Interest rate risk arises primarily from the groups long-term borrowings.
Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rate, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.
The groups policy, as set by the BT Group plc Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at fixed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director of Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the BT Group Treasurer who have been delegated such authority from the BT Group plc Board.
hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate profile, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of our long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to fixed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inflows and net outflows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The BT Group plc Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the type of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director of Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the BT Group Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency, capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The table below reflects the currency and interest rate profile of our loans and borrowings after the impact of hedging.
2015 2014 Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate interest interest Total interest interest Total At 31 March m m m m m m Sterling 7,601 1,995 9,596 7,946 1,265 9,211 Euro 482 482 285 285 Total 7,601 2,477 10,078 7,946 1,550 9,496 Ratio of fixed to floating 75% 25% 100% 84% 16% 100% Weighted average effective fixed interest rate Sterling 6.3% 6.6% The floating rate loans and borrowings bear interest rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one day to one year, primarily by reference to LIBOR and EURIBOR quoted rates.
Sensitivity analysis The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: for interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies for foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies The impact on the groups annual net finance expense of a 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease of 200m 2013 14: 207m.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates is as detailed below: 2015 2014 m m Increase Increase At 31 March reduce Reduce Sterling interest rates 428 337 US Dollar interest rates 400 361 Euro interest rates 34 14 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
The groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, and within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures was insignificant in both 2014 15 and 2013 14. Credit ratings The groups 2016 and 2030 bonds contain covenants which have required the group to pay higher rates of interest once the group ceased to be rated at least A3 in the case of Moodys or at least A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.5bn at 31 March 2015, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 12m a year if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
BT Group plcs credit ratings were as detailed below: 2015 2014 At 31 March rating Outlook Rating Outlook rating agency Standard & Poors BBB Stable BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 positive Baa2 Positive BT Group plc is targeting a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the medium term.

Financial instruments and risk management continued liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Refinancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise.
The maturity profile of the groups loans and borrowings at 31 March 2015 is disclosed in note 22.
The group has term debt maturities of 1.3bn in 2015 16.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
The group holds cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2015 the group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2013 14: 1.5bn maturing in September 2019 and a further 3.6bn 2013 14: nil with an availability period to the earlier of the completion of BT Group plc's planned acquisition of EE, or August 2016.
This is subject to certain restrictions and can only be used to fund the transaction, including transaction costs.
Maturity analysis The following table provides an analysis of the remaining contractually agreed cash flows including interest payable for the groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differs from both the carrying value and fair value.

Future variable interest rate cash flows were calculated using the most recent rate applied at the relevant balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables are held at amortised cost.
The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts payable.

b Foreign currency-related cash flows were translated at closing rates as at the relevant reporting date.
Credit risk management Management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the BT Group plc Boards defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moodys and S&P and by defining the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for shortterm investments.
Action is taken where appropriate and cost effective, if counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Operational management policy The BT Group plc Boards credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, the group may endeavour to minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2015 2014 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 1,329 653 Investments 20 23,185 21,398 a Trade and other receivables 15 2,264 2,189 Cash and cash equivalents 21 429 690 27,207 24,930 a The carrying amount excludes 184m 2013 14: 214m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 876m 2013 14: 722m of prepayments and other receivables.

Financial instruments and risk management continued The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.
2015 2014 Moodys S&P credit rating of counterparty m m Aa2 AA and above 3,133 1,774 Aa3 AA 206 47 A1 A 248 111 a A2 A 793 434 A3 A 121 Baa1 BBB 439 376 Baa2 BBB and below 11 4,951 2,742 a The group holds cash collateral of 437m 2013 14: 174m in respect of derivative financial assets with certain counterparties.
The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 15, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty, or group of related counterparties the group has entered into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
The group has also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby on a weekly and monthly basis the fair value position on notional 945m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash inflow during the year was 297m 2013 14: cash outflow of 209m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within current asset investments 2013 14: cash and cash equivalents, and loans and other borrowings, respectively.

At 31 March 2015 the amount deferred which is not yet recognised in the income statement is 14m 2013 14: 14m.
With the exception of this contract which is included at Level 3, and valued using assumptions on volumes, inflation, and market energy prices, all other derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 20.
Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to our 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect profit or loss as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings.
See note 22 Loans and other borrowings.
Forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies, are hedged 12 months forward, with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows will be recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were fully effective in the period.
See note 25 for details of the movements in the cash flow hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the 2028 Sterling bond due to movements in market interest rates.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 25.
Other derivatives BT Group plcs policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
