13 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS i Funded defined benefit plan Rexam PLC operates a funded defined benefit pension plan in the UK.
This plan is funded by the payment of contributions to a separately administered trust fund, partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from Rexam PLC and its subsidiaries, at rates advised by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Rexam PLC is the principal employer and legal sponsor and therefore, under FRS101, the net surplus in the plan of 101m 2014: 89m is recognised on its balance sheet at the fair value of plan assets, less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The plan is based on revalued career average earnings for members and is governed by a board of trustees which is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy.
The plan was closed to new entrants in 2011.
The duration of the plans liabilities is approximately 20 years 2014: 20 years.
The trustees are drawn partly from nominees of Rexam PLC and partly from the plans membership, as member nominated trustees.
The trustee also consults Rexam PLC regarding the appointment of the chair.
It is Rexams expectation that the composition of the trustees will remain at 50% member nominated, excluding the independent chairman.
The governance structure of the trustee board rests with the principal employer.
The plan is subject to a statutory funding objective, as set out in UK pensions legislation.
The trustees must obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met, and whether a recovery plan is needed to restore funding to the level of the technical provisions.
A full actuarial valuation by a qualified actuary was carried out as at 31 March 2014.
The results of that valuation have been used to calculate the liabilities on an accounting basis as at 31 December 2015.
The next full actuarial valuation will be carried out no later than 31 March 2017.
The escrow account has now been extended to run to 31 December 2020.
Under this agreement, 130m will be paid into this account by that date at a rate of 15m per year.
As at 31 December 2015, 55m 2014: 40m had been paid into this account.
At each subsequent valuation date, the assets in escrow will either be allocated to the plan, to Rexam PLC or remain in escrow depending on the funding position of the plan.
If there is a change of control with a subsequent material decline in Rexams credit rating or a material deterioration in Rexams financial covenant, the entire 130m escrow would be paid into the plan.
On an accounting basis at 31 December 2015 the plan was 105% funded 2014: 104%.
In 2009, Rexam PLC entered into a security agreement with the trustees, granting the plan a charge over the UK beverage can facilities and machinery at Milton Keynes and Wakefield which is enforceable up to 31 December 2020 in the event of a contribution default or a material decline in Rexams financial covenant.
Investment strategy is the responsibility of the trustees, with implementation powers delegated to an investment committee.
This investment committee includes employer representatives.
A strategy has been agreed to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, with planned regular switches from growth assets into bonds.
The switches may be accelerated under certain market conditions and triggers apply based on both funding level and market indices.
Hedging covering 80% 2014: 80% of interest rate risk and 79% 2014: 80% of inflation risk is currently in place.
The plan has been gender equalised following the European Barber equalisation regulations in 1990, although Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMPs held in the plan in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Plan between 1978 and 1997 have not themselves been equalised, as the UK government is yet to confirm how GMP equalisation is to be achieved.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REXAM ANNUAL REPORT 2015 145 13 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Rexam PLCs retirement benefit risk management for the plan is overseen by the Rexam retirement benefits committee.
This committee manages pension deficit volatility on the balance sheet and general risks within the plan, including equity, interest rate and inflation risk.
In general, trustees or similar bodies manage the defined benefit plan and set the required contribution rate based on independent actuarial advice in accordance with UK regulations.
Rexam PLC seeks to actively mitigate the risks associated with the plan.
Rexam PLC seeks a good working relationship with the trustees through regular meetings and pension matters are regularly reported to the Rexam Board.
The trustees cannot unilaterally wind up the plans nor do they have unilateral power to demand contributions or set contribution rates without employer consent.
There are no significant risks of immediate debt payments to the plans and there is no self investment.
There is a risk that changes in discount rates, price inflation, asset returns or mortality assumptions could lead to a material deficit.
Given the long term time horizon of the pension plan cash flows, the assumptions used are uncertain.
The assumptions can also be volatile from year to year due to changes in investment market conditions.
A higher pension deficit could directly impact Rexam PLCs equity valuation, credit rating and may lead to additional funding requirements in future years.
Any deficit relative to the actuarial liability for funding purposes, which may differ from the funding position on an accounting basis, will generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are reasonably affordable to Rexam PLC and in line with UK regulations.
Contingent contribution payment commitments from the escrow account may also become more likely.
