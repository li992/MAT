Retirement benefit obligations Employee benefits Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, less the fair value of plan assets, together withadjustments for past service costs not yet recognised.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions tothe plan.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in profit or loss.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of comprehensive income as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
Outside the UK, theCompany operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which employees of UK subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
Thedefined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees havebeen invited tojoin the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.
Victrex plc 89 Annual Report 2015 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 15.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Employee benefits continued Regarding our retirement benefit obligations, we announced a proposal in November 2015 to close the UK defined benefit scheme to future accrual.
Consultation began on 1 December 2015 with an expected completion date of 31 January 2016.
Subject to consultation, the scheme will close on 31March 2016, at which point employees in the defined benefit scheme will be eligible to join the defined contribution scheme.
IAS 19 disclosures relating to defined benefits are as follows: Principal actuarial assumptions As at 30 September 2015 2014 Discount rate 4.00% 4.00% Future salary increases 3.50% 3.50% Future pension increases 3.40% 3.40% Mortality tables S1NA CMI 2014 1.25% S1NA CMI 2013 1.25% Life expectancy from age 62 of current pensioners: 1 2 Male 25.1 yrs 25.0 yrs 1 2 Female 27.7 yrs 27.6 yrs Life expectancy from age 62 of active and deferred members: 3 4 Male 26.7 yrs 26.7 yrs 3 4 Female 29.4 yrs 29.3 yrs 1 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 62 in 2015.
2 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 62 in 2014.
3 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 45 in 2015.
4 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 45 in 2014.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 23 years 2014: 23 years.
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Increase in fund deficit Increase in fund deficit Change in assumption as at 30 September 2015 as at 30 September 2014 Reduce discount rate by 1% p. a.
15.2m 15.5m Increase inflation expectations by 1% p. a.
13.6m 13.9m Increase salary inflation by 1% p. a.
3.1m 3.2m In reality one might expect interrelationships between the assumptions, especially between discount rate and expected salary increases that both depend to a certain extent on expected inflation rates.
The above analysis does not take the effect of these interrelationships into account.
