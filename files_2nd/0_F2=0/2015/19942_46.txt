Acquisition The acquisition method is used to account for business combinations.
Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values oftheidentifiable assets acquired, including intangibles, and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities asrequired by IFRS 3.
In the event that this difference is negative, the amount is recognised directly in the consolidatedincome statement.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that are not classified as equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Acquisition of Kleiss Gears On 18 June 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Kleiss Gears, Inc a Wisconsin corporation and Kleiss Precision Tool Corp. a Wisconsin corporation for a cash consideration of $5.8m 3.8m.
In addition, debt of $0.4m 0.3m was paid on behalf of Kleiss Gears, Inc and Kleiss Precision Tool Corp, taking total consideration to $6.2m 4.1m.
Kleiss Gears is a US-based polymer gears manufacturer, with over 20 years experience of unique design and precision moulding capability in gears.
The acquisition is in line with Victrexs strategy of moving further downstream and investing in growth acceleration opportunities for its pipeline projects.
The net identifiable assets on acquisition of $3.4m 2.2m include intangible assets of $0.9m 0.6m, representing thefair value of Kleiss unique computer software and customer relationships, and property, plant and equipment of $1.9m 1.2m including a building purchased from Kleiss Environmental LLC, a related party of Kleiss Gears, as part ofthe purchase agreement.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of $2.4m 1.6m, see note 9 is best considered as goodwill on acquisition representing employee expertise and anticipated future operating synergies.
See note 9 for further details.
All of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.1m have been recognised as an expense within sales, marketing and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Included in the year ended 30 September 2015 is revenue of 0.7m and a profit before tax of 0.0m in respect of KleissGears.
Had the acquisition of Kleiss Gears been effected at 1 October 2014, the revenue and profit before tax ofthe Group for the current year would have been 265.2m and 106.4m respectively.
