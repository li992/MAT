Cash flow hedging In order to mitigate exposure to foreign currency risk on the consideration paid to acquire Fokker see note 30, the Group entered into a number of forward currency contracts to fix the sterling value of the euro denominated consideration.
Cash flow hedge accounting was applied as the purchase was deemed a highly probable transaction, which resulted in a gain of 5 million being taken to the hedging reserve.
On settlement of the consideration on 28 October 2015, the 5 million gain was recycled into the purchase price used for calculating goodwill.
Significant judgement and estimates Forward foreign currency contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives are marked to market using market observable rates and published prices together with forecast cash flow information where applicable.
The amounts in respect of embedded derivatives represent commercial contracts denominated in US dollars between European aerospace subsidiaries and customers outside the US.
