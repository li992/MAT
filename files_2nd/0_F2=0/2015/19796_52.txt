b The Tesco British Land Property Partnership and Tesco BL Holdings Limited are classified as assets held for sale at 28 February 2015.
They are therefore excluded from the summarised financial information for joint ventures and associates for 2015 below.
Further information is set out in Note 35. c Tesco Underwriting Limited under IFRS 11 is treated as a joint venture because the Group has joint control over key management decisions.
d On 28 May 2014 the Group completed its formation of a new venture with China Resources Enterprise Limited.
The new associate, Gain Land Limited, is a material associate to the Group.
e During the year the Group formed a new joint venture, Trent Hypermarket Limited, with Trent Limited at a cost of 102m.
The Group holds a 22% investment stake in Lazada Group GMBH Lazada.
This investment is not treated as an associate because the Group does not have the power to participate in key management decisions.
The accounting period end dates of the joint ventures and associates consolidated in these financial statements range from 31 December 2014 to 28 February 2015.
The accounting period end dates of the joint ventures differ from those of the Group for commercial reasons and depend upon the requirements of the joint venture partner as well as those of the Group.
The accounting period end dates of the associates are different from those of the Group as they depend upon the requirements of the parent companies of those entities.
There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the joint ventures and associates to transfer funds to the parent, other than those imposed by the Companies Act 2006.
Summarised financial information for joint ventures and associates The summarised financial information for UK Property joint ventures has been aggregated in order to provide useful information to users without excessive detail since these entities have similar characteristics and risk profiles largely based on the nature of their activites and geographic market.
The UK Property joint ventures involve the Group partnering with third parties in carrying out property investments in order to enhance returns from property and access funding whilst reducing risks associated with sole ownership.
These property investments generally cover shopping centres and standalone stores.
The Group enters into operating leases for some or all of the properties held in the joint ventures.
These leases provide the Group with some rights over alterations and adjacent land developments.
Some leases also provide the Group with options to purchase the other joint venturers equity stakes at a future point in time.
In some cases the Group has the ability to substitute properties in the joint ventures with alternative properties of similar value, subject to strict eligibility criteria.
In other cases, the Group carries out property management activities for third party rentals of shopping centre units.
The property investment activities are carried out in separate entities, usually partnerships or limited liability companies.
The Group has assessed its ability to direct the relevant activities of these entities and impact Group returns and concluded that the entities qualify as joint ventures since decisions regarding them require the unanimous consent of both equity holders.
This assessment included not only rights within the joint venture agreements, but also any rights within the other contractual arrangements between the Group and the entities.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 111 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 13 Group entities continued The Group made a number of judgements and assertions in arriving at this determination, the key ones being: since the provisions of the joint venture agreements require the relevant decisions impacting investor returns to be either unanimously agreed by both joint venturers at the same time, or in some cases to be agreed sequentially by each venturer at different stages, there is joint decision making within the joint venture: since the Groups leases are priced at fair value, and any rights embedded in the leases are consistent with market practice, they do not provide the Group with additional control over the joint ventures or infer an obligation by the Group to fund the settlement of liabilities of the joint ventures: any options to purchase the other joint venturers equity stakes are priced at market value, and only exercisable at future dates, hence they do not provide control to the Group at the current time: where the Group has a right to substitute properties in the joint ventures, the rights are strictly limited and are at fair value, hence do not provide control to the Group: and where the Group carries out property management activities for third party rentals in shopping centres, these additional activities are controlled through joint venture agreements or lease agreements, and do not provide the Group with additional powers over the joint venture.
The summarised financial information below reflects the amounts presented in the financial statements of the relevant joint ventures and associates, and not the Groups share of those amounts.
These amounts have been adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies where required.

The Group led the formation of the entities and its name appears in the names of the entities and or on the debt issued by the entities.
The structured entities were set up to finance property purchases by some of the UK Property joint ventures in which the Group typically holds a 50% equity interest.
The structured entities obtain debt financing from third party investors and lend the funds to these joint ventures, who use the funds to purchase the properties.
The liabilities of the UK Property joint ventures disclosed above include the loans due to these structured entities.
The Groups exposure to the structured entities is limited to the extent of the Groups interests in the joint ventures.
The liabilities of the structured entities are non-recourse to the Group.
The Group concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate, these structured entities, since it does not have power over the relevant activities of the structured entities, or exposure to variable returns from these entities.
