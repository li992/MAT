The interest rate swaps are used to hedge the fair value of the Groups GBP denominated bonds and the change in the fair value of the underlying bonds due to changes in interest rates is equivalent to the fair value of the interest rate swaps recognised above.
Details of the interest rate swaps, currency swaps and cash flow hedges are contained in note 26.
17 Business combinations 2015 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2015 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: Public sector Fair value subsidiary to Group partnership Other recognised on avocis FERA acquisitions acquisition m m m m Property, plant and equipment 5.7 3.4 2.2 11.3 Intangible assets 105.1 10.9 102.7 218.7 Trade and other receivables due in less than one year 37.1 2.7 45.3 85.1 Corporation tax 8.6 0.4 9.0 Cash and cash equivalents 6.4 13.8 20.2 Trade and other payables excluding accruals due in less than one year 9.5 1.8 21.4 32.7 Accruals due in less than one year 10.1 1.1 29.4 40.6 Provisions 3.6 3.7 7.3 Deferred tax 19.5 2.1 14.7 36.3 Employee benefits liability 4.3 4.3 Finance leases 0.1 0.1 Long-term debt 39.3 9.0 48.3 Net assets 59.4 12.0 85.3 156.7 Goodwill arising on acquisition 78.0 14.7 167.8 260.5 137.4 26.7 253.1 417.2 Discharged by: Cash 137.4 20.0 230.2 387.6 Contingent consideration accrued 12.9 12.9 Deferred consideration accrued 10.0 10.0 Non-controlling interest 6.7 6.7 137.4 26.7 253.1 417.2 Strategic report Governance Accounts Capita plc 133 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Business combinations continued Public sector subsidiary partnership represents a 75% controlling interest in Fera Science Limited.
In all other cases 100% of the share capital or business assets and liabilities was acquired.
The businesses acquired have been mainly in the areas of IT and software, customer and debt management, mortgage administration, and property services, which complement or extend the Groups existing skill sets and provide opportunities for growth into these markets.
In addition during the year the Group settled 32.1m of contingent consideration and 11.6m of deferred consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions, all of which had been accrued.
Where this can be determined, the acquired subsidiaries contributed 27.4m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2015, Group revenue would have been an estimated 4,896.5m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 113.3m.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2015.
During the year, some of the acquired businesses have been completely integrated into the existing business of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance cannot be determined.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisitions because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses, particularly from synergies, and the capabilities of the acquired workforce.
The total amount of goodwill recognised in the period that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is 44.4m 2014: 9.6m.
The fair value exercise has been completed on a provisional basis for acquisitions made in 2015.
The Group will complete this review in 2016 though any adjustment to the carrying value is likely to be insignificant to the individual acquisition.
In total, the effect of revisions made to fair value adjustments in the current year that had been determined provisionally at the immediately preceding balance sheet date increases goodwill by 1.1m.
Contingent consideration In respect of the acquisitions made in 2015, the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 3 years in duration and will be settled in cash and loan notes on their payment date on achieving the relevant targets.
The range of the additional consideration payment is estimated to be between 5m and 22m.
The Group has included 12.9m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the postacquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 16.2m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal related costs.
These costs have been included in non-underlying administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
2014 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2014 which are shown in aggregate.

In addition, during the year the Group settled 35.5m of deferred consideration and 9.2m of contingent consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions, all of which had been accrued.
