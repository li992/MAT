against which the asset can be utilised.
In 2014, an asset of $42.0 million was recognised relating to UK advance corporation credits which hadpreviously been unrecognised because of uncertainty over the availability of UK taxable profits and hence a tax liability against which to utilise the credits.
During 2014 the Group transferred some profitable product manufacturing to the UK from overseas, restructured the financing of an overseas subsidiary and gained greater certainty on future UK pension contributions, all of which ledto a reasonable expectation that UK taxable profits would arise inthe future and therefore that the tax credits should be recognised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

The net impact of these items on Group profit before tax for the year is a credit of $5.6 million 2014: $6.3 million.
The items fall into four categories, as summarised below: Land sale net credit of $17.0 million On 26 July 2015, Chromium sold a non-operating portion of its site at Corpus Christi, US, for total proceeds of $26.0 million.
After transaction costs and deduction of the book value of the land, the net gain on the sale was $23.8 million.
The terms of the disposal crystallised certain future regulatory and monitoring obligations for the Group and the $6.8 million one time cost of these has been deducted to arrive at a net profit on property disposal of $17.0 million and added to the Groups existing environmental provisions.
Restructuring charge of $4.2 million In October 2015, the Group announced that it was taking certain actions to reduce costs by reducing its workforce and reorganising some parts of itsmanagement structure, including the recruitment of a new Group Chief Executive.
The one time cost of this exercise including redundancy costs, aswell as recruitment and other costs associated with changes in the management structure, was $4.2 million.
Anticipated annual savings from this exercise are approximately $4.0 million and will largely be realised from 2016 onwards.
Other charge of $7.2 million A provision has been set up within Chromium that relates to a legacy right of first refusal agreement with a third party.
Under that agreement, Chromium pays a fixed annual fee in return for the right to acquire certain land in North Carolina for operating purposes.
Payment of the fixed fee is also related to the continued use of certain disposal facilities.
Based on the current operating plans of the Chromium business and the estimated value of this land, there is now a low likelihood that the Group will exercise this right of first refusal in the future.
Hence a provision has been recorded for the remaining payments under that agreement in the amount of $4.0 million.
Other items totalling $2.2 million relate to the impairment of certain software licences, as well as due diligence and other costs associated with investment projects that were not successful.
In addition, the Group has also recorded a provision of $1.0 million for the potential outcome of a regulatory case in Europe.
Taxation charge of $7.2 million Within non-recurring items there is a tax charge of $7.2 million of which $2.5 million relates to the net tax on the non-recurring items recorded in 2015 and a charge of $4.7 million arising from a reassessment of the ACT and deferred tax assets established in 2014.

The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $321.9 million and Elementis Surfactants $2.8 million.
There is no goodwill associated with Elementis Chromium.
72 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2015 The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
In order to stress test the results over a wider range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital structures that reflect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs.
In this exercise a range of discount rates from 8.0 per cent to 14.0 per cent 2014: 7.0 per cent to 8.5 per cent was used.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following 17 years based on estimated growth rates of 0 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed theaverage long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The results of the impairment testing using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangibles represent the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the Deuchem, Fancor, Watercryl and Hi-Mar acquisitions.
The Group considers these to have significant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate toassign these assets an indefinite useful life.
Brand intangibles are tested annually for impairment using similar assumptions to the goodwill testing.
The remaining intangible assets comprise the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of five to ten years.

Where this is not the case, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
There are no significant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in subsidiaries and associates.
An asset of $42.0 million was recognised in 2014 relating to UK advance corporation tax credits which had previously been unrecognised because of uncertainty over future UK taxable profits.
During 2014 the Group made certain changes to its manufacturing and financing structures, which together with greater certainty over the funding of the UK pension deficit, led to the view that UK taxable profits would increase and therefore that the tax credits should be recognised.

Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in itsoversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, andarises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups revenue.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through a treasury policy that imposes graduated limits on the amount of funds that can be deposited with counterparties by reference to the counterparties credit ratings, as defined by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had $115.1 million 2014: $118.1 million of undrawn committed facilities, of which $100.0 million expires after more than one year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value ofitsholdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the US dollar and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 100 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with amaturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US dollar, but also euro and pounds sterling.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of a subsidiarys net assets.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2015 77 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 CONTINUED 21.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest profile.
The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
In respect of the US schemes, management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of theGroups investment strategy is to maximise investment returns, without excessive risk taking, in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded benefit obligations: management is assisted by external advisors in this regard.
In respect of the UK scheme, the investment strategy is set by the trustees and the Board is kept informed.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development ofthe business.
The Board monitors the return on operating capital employed ROCE both including and excluding goodwill, as defined on page 14.
TheGroups target is to achieve a ROCE including goodwill in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees, including executive directors, hold 0.4 per cent 2014: 0.3 per cent of ordinary shares, or 1.8 per cent 2014: 1.7 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.
Current dividend policy is to pay a progressive dividend of approximately one third of earnings per share before non-recurring items.
Additionally if the Group finishes the year in a net balance sheet cash position, and there are no immediate investment plans for that cash, the Group may recommend anadditional special dividend of up to 50 per cent of the net cash amount.
These dividend policies remain under review to ensure that they remain appropriate to the circumstances and strategy of the Group.

Financial risk management continued Basis for determining fair values The Group measures fair values in respect of financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 13, using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
Derivatives level 2 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value isestimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest based on government bonds.
Non-derivatives financial liabilities level 2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reportingdate.
Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables level 3 The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2015 2014 per cent per cent Borrowings 0.92.7 1.02.8 The Group categorises its trade and other receivables and payables, excluding derivatives, within level 3 and all other financial instruments, including cash, loans and derivatives within level 2.
At both 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015 there was no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial instruments.
Operating leases 2015 2014 $million $million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 5.4 3.7 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2015 2014 $million $million Within one year 0.4 0.4 In the second to fifth years inclusive 2.6 1.5 After five years 19.4 21.3 22.4 23.2 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits for the majority of employees and executive directors.
At 31 December 2015 the main schemes in the UK and US were of the defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the defined benefit pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 and the Group contracted with a new industry wide pension fund for 2015 onwards.
As a result, the plan is now accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post retirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
Other employee benefit schemes included in the table below relate to two unfunded pension schemes, a long term service award scheme in Germany and a special benefits programme for a small number of former employees of the Eaglescliffe plant.

Contributions in 2016 are expected to be in the range $10-$15 million.
Further details on agreed future payments to the UK pension scheme are included in the Finance report.

Within the UK pension scheme, the current asset allocation is approximately 40 per cent in a liability matching fund consisting of gilts fixed interest and index linked, bonds, cash and swaps and 60 per cent in an investment fund that includes various equity and equity like funds.
The aim of the trustees is to manage the risk relative to the liabilities associated with the schemes investments through a combination of diversification, inflation protection and hedging of risk currency, interest rate and inflation risk.
The US scheme currently has over 60 per cent of its asset value invested in a range of equity funds designed to target higher returns and thus reduce the pension deficit, with the balance invested in fixed income bonds and cash.
The strategy is that as the deficit reduces, a greater proportion of investments will be made into liability matching funds.

The principal assumptions used by the actuaries for the major schemes were as follows: UK US Netherlands per cent per cent per cent 2015 Rate of increase in salaries 4.10 3.00 3.45 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00 N A Discount rate 3.70 4.10 Inflation 3.10 2.25 2014 Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 3.45 2.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.90 N A N A Discount rate 3.40 3.65 2.25 Inflation 3.00 2.25 2.00 86 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2015 The assumed life expectancies on retirement are: UK US 2015 2014 2015 2014 years years years years Retiring at 31 December 2015 Males 22 22 21 21 Females 25 24 23 22 Retiring in 20 years Males 25 25 22 21 Females 26 26 24 23 The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 4.1 per cent 2014: 3.65 per cent per annum and a health care cost trend of 6.5 per cent 2014: 6.5 per cent per annum for claims pre age 65 reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2021 2014: 4.5 per cent.
Actuarial valuations of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposes or disclosed separately because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.
At 31 December 2015, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations for the major schemes was as follows: UK: 13 years US: 11 years Sensitivity analysis The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increased decreased by 0.5 per cent Decreased increased by 6 per cent Rate of inflation Increased decreased by 0.5 per cent Increased decreased by 4 per cent Rate of salary growth Increased decreased by 0.5 per cent Increased decreased by 0 per cent Rate of mortality Increased by 1 year Increased by 4 per cent These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement of the defined obligation following a change in a particular assumption in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions.
Share based payments The Company has several share incentive schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
A Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2008 amended in 2010 and 2015 LTIP for selected senior executives including the executive directors, business presidents and general counsel.
Awards of nil cost share options or conditional share awards are normally made annually and the maximum value of any grant to an individual is two times the CEOs basic salary.
Awards vest after three years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions over a three year period.
Vested awards are then exercisable for up to seven years, subject to the rules of the plan.
For US participants prior to 2015 for tax reasons, the default practice is for options to be exercised at the date of vesting.
From 2015, US participants received awards structured as restricted stock units.
For other executives, shareholders approved at the 2012 AGM an approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2012 ESOS.
This scheme replaced the previous approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2003 ESOS which expired in 2013.
The last awards made under the 2003 scheme were in 2012.
Under the 2003 and 2012 ESOS, options are usually granted annually to purchase shares in the Company at an exercise price per share based on the Companys average mid-market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant with no discount applied.
The number of options that are granted are based on a percentage of the participants basic salary.
Options vest after three years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions.
Vested options are then exercisable for up to seven years, subject to the rules of the schemes.
The Company operates two shadow executive share option schemes for a number of executives, who are employed or based in China, that are structured in almost all respects as the 2003 and 2012 ESOS.
The Company also operates a 2008 UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is a save as you earn SAYE scheme, under which UK employees can enter into contracts to save currently up to a maximum of 500 per month with a bank or building society for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price over the five working days preceding the invitation date, discounted by 20 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within six months following the end of the savings period.
A similar scheme exists for US employees.
Under the 2008 US Sharesave Scheme, US employees can enter into contracts to save up to a maximum of $2,000 per month with a bank or similarly approved institution, for a period of two years, and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within three months following the end of the savings period.
Options granted under the two savings based schemes are held subject to the rules of the schemes.

Share based payments continued Options were valued as shown in the table below using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2015 2014 Fair value per option pence 136.8 154.0 Expected volatility per cent 27.0 33.4 Risk free rate per cent 0.9 1.5 Expected dividend yield per cent 1.1 2.0 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $2.1 million 2014: $2.5 million related to share based payment transactions during the year.
These shadow options are included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.
The liability for the shadow options and the amount that had vested at the end of the period was $0.3 million.

Related party transactions The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a specified maximum amount.
The maximum amount of the guarantee isthat which is needed at the time the guarantee is called on to bring the schemes funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund PPF guarantee, as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

Directors remuneration is set out in the Directors remuneration report on pages 35 to 51.
Contingent liabilities As is the case with other chemical companies, the Group occasionally receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters.
A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material outflow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
No contingent liability was considered to be reportable at 31 December 2015.
