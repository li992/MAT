The uncertainties preventing recognition of these losses will not be resolved until 2017 and a corresponding provision was created against their use.
The net movement on provisions was reduced to 23million by the resolution of a long standing dispute through a bilateral negotiation between tax authorities.
Management tax rate The tax charge arising on management profits of subsidiaries of 544 million 2014: 539 million was 133 million 2014: 121million charge giving an effective tax rate of 24% 2014: 22%.
Significant judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic tax positions.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.
