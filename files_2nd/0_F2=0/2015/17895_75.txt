Taxation expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted atthe reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences: on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws thathave been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

2015 includes a 52m credit in respect of the adjustment of certain UK tax provisions in the light of clarification received.
2015 includes an 82m credit in respect of the adjustment of certain overseas tax provisions in the light of rulings received.
2014 included a 51m credit in respect of the re-assessment of existing tax provisions where information received in the year enabled the estimate to be updated.
The UK current tax rate was reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015, and will be reduced to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
In line with this change, the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has been reduced from 20% to 18%, creating a rate adjustment in 2015, which is partly reected in the Consolidated income statement and partly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Taxation expense continued Reconciliation of taxation expense The following table reconciles the theoretical income tax expense, using the UK corporation tax rate, to the reported tax expense.
The reconciling items represent, besides the impact of tax rate differentials and changes, non-taxable benets or non-deductible expenses arising from differences between the local tax base and the reported financial statements.

2015 includes credits totalling 134m in respect of the adjustment of certain UK and overseas tax provisions in the light of clarification and rulings received.
2014 included a51m credit in respect of the re-assessment of existing tax provisions where information received in the year enabled the estimate to be updated, which was excluded from the calculation of the underlying effective tax rate.
In 2013, UK legislation changed so that UK government credits for research and development spend are now accounted for as part of operating profit rather than as part of taxation expense.
This treatment was optional for the first three years.
During 2015, the Group exercised that option, effective from 2013, and has reected this change in the 2015 accounts.
The adjustment reverses this treatment to show an underlying effective tax rate that is comparable with the prior year.
The 77m excluded from profit before taxation comprises 50m included in non-recurring items relating to 2013 and 2014 see note 1 and 27m included in underlying EBITA relating to 2015, of which 12m relates to the Groups share of equity accounted investments.
The 68m includes 45m relating to the 50m included in non-recurring items.
