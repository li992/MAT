15.2 Assumptions a Market conditions In general, the models used assume that the property markets in which the Group operates which drive its revenue growth will remain stable.
b Discount rate The discount rate applied to cash flows of each CGU is based on the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
WACC is the average cost of sources of financing debt and equity, each of which is weighted by its respective use.
Key inputs to the WACC calculation are the risk-free rate, the equity market risk premium the return that Savills shares provide over the risk-free rate, beta reflecting the risk of the Group relative to the market as awhole and the Groups borrowing rates.
Group WACC was adjusted for risk relative to the country in which the assets were located.
The risk-adjusted discount range of rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2015 2014 Discount rate range Discount rate range United Kingdom 10.0% 9.8% Continental Europe 10.0% 9.8% Asia Pacific 11.6%18.1% 9.5%14.4% United States 10.0% 9.8% c Long-term growth rate To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, aterminal value was calculated, using average long-term growth rates.
The rates are based on the long-term growth rate in the countries in which the Group operates.
The long-term growth rates used in each region for impairment testing are as follows: 2015 2014 Long-term growth Long-term growth rate range rate range United Kingdom 2.0% 2.0% Continental Europe 1.5% 1.0%2.5% Asia Pacific 1.5%5.0% 1.5%5.0% United States 1.9% 1.9% SAVILLS PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 109
