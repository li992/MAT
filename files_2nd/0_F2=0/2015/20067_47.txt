Taxation continued Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2014 were calculated using a rate of 20%.
This resulted in a tax credit of 208m, which was treated as a specific item in the income statement note 8 and a deferred tax expense of 288m in reserves for the year ending 31 March 2014.
As all deferred tax balances were measured at 20% at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2015, there was no further impact on deferred taxation for the year ending 31 March 2015.
Unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences At 31 March 2015, the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 21.0bn 2013 14: 21.6bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2015 At 31 March m Expiry of losses restricted losses Europe 356 20162034 Americas 10 20242034 Other 73 20162023 Total restricted losses 439 unrestricted losses Operating losses 3,193 No expiry Capital losses 17,150 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 20,343 other temporary differences 195 Total 20,977 At 31 March 2015, the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were 8.1bn 2013 14: 8.3bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise.
Dividends A dividend of 1,200m 2013 14: 1,300m, equivalent to 13.8p per ordinary share 2013 14: 15.0p per share was settled on 15 May 2014 in relation to the year ended 31 March 2014.
This is disclosed in the group statement of changes in equity.
The directors have declared a final dividend of 1,450m, which will be recognised as an appropriation of retained earnings in 2015 16.
As the dividend was declared after 31 March 2015, no liability is recorded in these financial statements.
