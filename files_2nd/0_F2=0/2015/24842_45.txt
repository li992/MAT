Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2015 3.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued The other material impacts on the measurement of fair value are inflation rates, deposit rates and tax rates which are further discussed in Note 4 and include sensitivities to these key judgements.
Financial instruments Fair value estimation The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Consolidated Group uses the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to relevant long term government bond yields, the specific risks of each investment and the evidence of recent transactions.
Note 2 discloses the methods used in determining fair values on a specific asset or liability basis.
Where applicable, further information about the assumptions used in determining fair value is disclosed in the Notes specific to that asset or liability.
Classification of financial instruments 31 March 2015 31 March 2014 million million Financial assets Investments designated at fair value through profit or loss 1,709.7 1,495.5 At fair value through profit or loss Other financial assets fair value of derivatives 1.9 0.8 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 1,711.6 1,496.3 Trade and other receivables 0.7 1.1 Cash and cash equivalents 33.5 42.7 Financial assets loans and receivables 34.2 43.8 Financial liabilities At fair value through profit or loss Other financial liabilities fair value of derivatives 0.6 0.5 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 0.6 0.5 Trade and other payables 12.3 10.1 Other financial liabilities 12.3 10.1 The Directors believe that the carrying values of all financial instruments are equal to their fair values.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value hierarchy is defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Level 2 Valuation methodology The Directors have satisfied themselves as to the methodology used for the valuation of Level 2 financial assets and liabilities.
All financial assets and liabilities are valued using a discounted cashflow methodology, consistent with the prior period.
The key inputs to this methodology are foreign currency exchange rates and foreign currency forward curves.
Fair value is based on price quotations from financial institutions active in the relevant market.
Valuations are performed on a 6 monthly basis every September and March for all financial assets and liabilities.
Level 3 Valuation methodology The Directors have satisfied themselves as to the methodology used, the discount rates and key assumptions applied, and the valuation.
All investments in PFI PPP P3 projects are valued using a discounted cashflow methodology.
The valuation techniques and methodologies have been applied consistently with those used in the prior period.
This valuation uses key assumptions which are benchmarked from a review of recent comparable market transactions in order to arrive at a fair market value.
Valuations are performed on a 6 monthly basis every September and March for all investments.
For the valuation of investments, the Directors have also obtained an independent opinion from a third party with experience in valuing these type of investments, supporting the reasonableness of the valuation.
Investments The key valuation assumptions and sensitivities for the valuation are: Discount rates Judgement is used in arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each investment based on the Investment Advisers knowledge of the market, taking into account intelligence gained from bidding activities, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of these markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.
The discount rates used for valuing each infrastructure investment can be considered as the appropriate long-dated government bond yield and a risk premium.
The risk premium varies on a project-by-project basis and takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings e. g. predictability and covenant of the concession income, all of which may be differentiated by project phase, and market participants appetite for these risks.

Financial Instruments continued The discount rates.
used for valuing the projects in the portfolio are as follows: Period ending Range Weighted average 31 March 2014 7.8% to 11.0% 8.2% 30 September 2014 7.6% to 11.0% 8.0% 31 March 2015 7.4% to 10.5% 7.9% A change to the weighted average rate of 7.9% by plus or minus 0.5% has the following effect on the valuation.
Discount rate -0.5% change Total portfolio value 0.5% change Directors valuation 85.8m 1,709.7m -79.4m Implied change in Net Asset Value per 6.8 pence -6.3 pence 1 Ordinary Share 1.
Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share based on 1,268 million Ordinary Shares at 31 March 2015 Inflation rates All projects in the portfolio have contractual income streams with public sector clients, which are rebased every year for inflation.
UK projects tend to use either RPI Retail Price Index or RPIx RPI excluding mortgage payments, and revenues are either partially or totally indexed depending on the contract and the nature of the projects financing.
Facilities management sub-contracts have similar indexation arrangements.
The portfolio valuation assumes long term UK inflation of 2.75% per annum for both RPI and RPIx, the same assumption as used at 30 September 2014 and 31 March 2014.
For non-UK investments, long term CPI of 2.0% per annum is used for Holland, Ireland, Canada and France the same assumption as used at 30 September 2014 and 31 March 2014 and 2.5% for Australia the same assumption as used at 30 September 2014.
The near term inflation assumption to March 2017 in the Eurozone is 0.0% per annum.
A change to the inflation rate by plus or minus 0.5% has the following effect on the valuation: 1 Inflation assumption -0.5% p. a. change Total portfolio value 0.5% p. a. change Directors valuation -52.9m 1,709.7m 57.6m Implied change in Net Asset Value per -4.2 pence 4.5 pence 2 Ordinary Share 1.
Analysis is based on the Consolidated Groups 20 largest investments, pro-rata for the whole portfolio 2.
Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share based on 1,268 million Ordinary Shares at 31 March 2015 Deposit rates Each PFI PPP P3 project in the portfolio has cash held in bank deposits, which is a requirement of their senior debt financing.
As at 31 March 2015 cash deposits for the portfolio were earning interest at a rate of 0.4% per annum on average.
The March 2015 portfolio valuation assumes UK deposit interest rates are 1% p. a. to March 2019 and 3.0% p. a. thereafter, changed from September 2014 and March 2014 when the assumption was 1% p. a. to March 2018 and 3.5% p. a. thereafter.
Each projects interest costs are either inflation-linked or fixed rate.
This is achieved through fixed rate or inflation-linked bonds, or bank debt which is hedged with an interest rate swap.
A projects sensitivity to interest rates relates to the cash deposits required as part of the project funding.
Financial Instruments continued A change to the deposit rate by plus or minus 0.5% has the following effect on the valuation: Cash deposit rate Base case is 1.0% p. a. til March 2019, -0.5% p. a. change Total portfolio value 0.5% p. a. change then 3.0% p. a.
Directors valuation -19.8m 1,709.7m 19.4m Implied change in Net Asset Value per -1.6 pence 1.5 pence 1, 2 Ordinary Share 1.
This analysis is based on the Consolidated Groups 20 largest investments, pro-rata for the whole portfolio 2.
Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share based on 1,268 million Ordinary Shares at 31 March 2015 Tax rates The profits of each UK PFI project company are subject to UK corporation tax.
On 1 April 2014 the prevailing rate of corporation tax fell from 23% to 21%.
The Finance Act 2013 enacted a further reduction of 1% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015.
The UK corporation tax assumption for the portfolio valuation at 31 March 2015 was 20% for all future periods the same assumption as used at 30 September 2014 and changed from March 2014 when it was 21%.
A change to the tax rate by plus or minus 1.0% has the following effect on the valuation: 1 Tax rate assumption -1% p. a. change Total portfolio value 1% p. a. change Directors valuation 11.0m 1,709.7m -11.0m Implied change in Net Asset Value per 0.9 pence -0.9 pence 2 Ordinary Share 1.
Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share based on 1,268 million Ordinary Shares at 31 March 2015 Risk management Market risk Returns from the Consolidated Groups investments are affected by the price at which they are acquired.
The value of these investments will be a function of the discounted value of their expected future cash flows, and as such will vary with, inter alia, movements in interest rates, market prices and the competition for such assets.
Financial risk management The objective of the Consolidated Groups financial risk management is to manage and control the risk exposures of its investment portfolio.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks, however the review and management of financial risks are delegated to the Investment Adviser and the Operator which has documented procedures designed to identify, monitor and manage the financial risks to which the Consolidated Group is exposed.
This Note presents information about the Consolidated Groups exposure to financial risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the Consolidated Groups management of its financial resources.
The Consolidated Group owns a portfolio of investments predominantly in the subordinated loanstock and equity of project finance companies.
These companies are structured at the outset to minimise financial risks where possible, and the Investment Adviser and Operator primarily focus their risk management on the direct financial risks of acquiring and holding the portfolio but continue to monitor the indirect financial risks of the underlying projects through representation, where appropriate, on the Boards of the project companies and the receipt of regular financial and operational performance reports.
Interest rate risk The Consolidated Group invests in subordinated loanstock of project companies, usually with fixed interest rate coupons.
Where floating rate debt is owned the primary risk is that the Consolidated Groups cash flows will be subject to variation depending upon changes to base interest rates.
The portfolios cash flows are continually monitored and reforecasted both over the near future five year time horizon and the long-term over whole period of projects concessions to analyse the cash flow returns from investments.
The Consolidated Group has made limited use of borrowings to finance the acquisition of investments and the forecasts are used to monitor the impact of changes in borrowing rates against cash flow returns from investments as increases in borrowing rates will reduce net interest margins.
H ICL A N N U A L R E PO R T & A C COU N T S 2015 91 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2015 4.
Financial Instruments continued The Consolidated Groups policy is to ensure that interest rates are sufficiently hedged to protect the Consolidated Groups net interest margins from significant fluctuations when entering into material medium long term borrowings.
This may include engaging in interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivative contracts.
The Consolidated Group has an indirect exposure to changes in interest rates through its investment in project companies, which are financed by senior debt.
Senior debt financing of project companies is generally either through floating rate debt, fixed rate bonds or index linked bonds.
Where senior debt is floating rate, the projects typically have concession length hedging arrangements in place, which are monitored by the project companies managers, finance parties and boards of directors.
Floating rate debt is hedged using fixed floating interest rate swaps.
Inflation risk The Consolidated Groups project companies are generally structured so that contractual income and costs are either wholly or partially linked to specific inflation where possible to minimise the risks of mismatch between income and costs due to movements in inflation indexes.
The Consolidated Groups overall cashflows vary with inflation, although they are not directly correlated as not all flows are indexed.
The effects of these inflation changes do not always immediately flow through to the Consolidated Groups cashflows, particularly where a projects loanstock debt carries a fixed coupon and the inflation changes flow through by way of changes to dividends in future periods.
The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation to inflation is shown in Note 4.
Currency risk The projects in which the Consolidated Group invests, all conduct their business in the United Kingdom and pay loan interest, loan principal, dividends and fees in sterling other than its investments in France, Holland and Ireland comprising 6% 2014: 6% of the portfolio by value, which conduct their business and pay their loan interest, loan principal, dividends and fees in Euros, its investments in Canada comprising 1% 2014: 2% of the portfolio by value, which conduct their business and pay loan interest, loan principal, dividends and fees in Canadian dollars and its investment in Australia comprising 4% of the portfolio by value, which conduct its business and pays loan interest, loan principal, dividends and fees in Australian dollars.
The Consolidated Group monitors its foreign exchange exposures using its near term and long term cash flow forecasts.
Its policy is to use foreign exchange hedging to provide protection to the level of sterling distributions that the Consolidated Group expects to receive over the medium term, where considered appropriate.
This may involve the use of forward exchange and other currency hedging contracts, as well as the use of Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and other currency denominated borrowings.
The Consolidated Group at 31 March 2015 hedged its currency exposure through Euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar forward contracts.
This has minimised the volatility in the Net Asset Value from foreign exchange movements.
The hedging policy is designed to provide confidence in the near term yield and to limit Net Asset Value per share sensitivity to no more than 1% for a 10% foreign exchange movement.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Consolidated Group will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Consolidated Group.
The Consolidated Groups key direct counterparties are the project companies in which it makes investments.
The Consolidated Groups near term cash flow forecasts are used to monitor the timing of cash receipts from project counterparties.
Underlying to the cash flow forecasts are project company cash flow models, which are regularly updated by project companies and provided to the Operator, for the purposes of demonstrating the projects ability to pay interest and dividends based on a set of detailed assumptions.
Many of the Consolidated Groups investment and subsidiary entities receive revenue from government departments, and public sector or local authority clients.
Therefore a significant portion of the Consolidated Groups investments revenue is with counterparties of good financial standing.
The Consolidated Group is also reliant on each projects subcontractors continuing to perform their service delivery obligations such that revenues to projects are not disrupted.
The Investment Adviser has a subcontractor counterparty monitoring procedure in place.
The credit standing of subcontractors is reviewed, and the risk of default estimated for each significant counterparty position.
Monitoring is ongoing and period end positions are reported to the Board on a quarterly basis.
The Consolidated Groups largest credit risk exposure to a project at 31 March 2015 was to the Pinderfields & Pontefract Hospitals project 6% of portfolio by value and the largest subcontractor counterparty risk exposure was to subsidiaries of the Carillion group which provided facilities management services in respect of 17% of the portfolio by value.
Financial Instruments continued Credit risk continued The Consolidated Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Consolidated Groups cash and deposits are held with well-known banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Consolidated Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
The Consolidated Groups maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets is the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet.
The Consolidated Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Consolidated Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as these fall due.
The Consolidated Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to meets its liabilities when due.
The Consolidated Group ensures it maintains adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Consolidated Group investments are predominantly funded by share capital and medium term debt funding.
The Consolidated Groups investments are generally in private companies in which there is no listed market and therefore such investment would take time to realise and there is no assurance that the valuations placed on the investments would be achieved from any such sale process.
The Consolidated Groups investments have third party borrowings which rank senior to the Consolidated Groups own investments into the companies.
This senior debt is structured such that, under normal operating conditions, it will be repaid within the expected life of the projects.
Debt raised by the investment companies from third parties is without recourse to the Consolidated Group.
The Consolidated Groups investments may include obligations to make future investment amounts.
These obligations will typically be supported by standby letters of credit, issued by the Consolidated Groups bankers in favour of the senior lenders to the investment companies.
Such subscription obligations are met from the Consolidated Groups cash resources when they fall due.
Such obligations totalled 22.5 million 2014: 5.1 million and the Consolidated Group also has a contingent commitment of 16.8 million at the year end Note 18.
Unconsolidated subsidiaries are subject to contractual agreements that may impose temporary restrictions on their ability to distribute cash.
Such restrictions are not deemed significant in the context of the Consolidated Groups overall liquidity.
The table below analyses the Consolidated Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
