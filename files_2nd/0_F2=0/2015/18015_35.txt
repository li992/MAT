In addition, the Group is in an active process to sell a further specialist insurance business, a health business and a justice business and is therefore treating these businesses as a disposal group held for sale.
Since the year end, the health business has been sold note 35 and the sale of the remaining two businesses is expected to complete in the next 12 months.
None of our 2015 business exits or businesses in the process of being exited meet the definition of discontinued operations as stipulated by IFRS 5, which requires disclosure and restatement of comparatives where the relative size of a disposal or business closure is significant, which is normally understood to mean a reported segment.
Accordingly, the separate presentation described below does not fall within the requirements of IFRS 5 concerning discontinued operations and comparatives have not been restated.
