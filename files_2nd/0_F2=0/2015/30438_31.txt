Dividend tax allowance From April 2016 dividend tax credits will be replaced by an annual 5,000 tax-free allowance on dividend income across an individuals entire share portfolio.
Above this amount, individuals will pay tax on their dividend income at a rate dependent on their income tax bracket and personal circumstances.
The Company will continue to provide registered shareholders with a confirmation of the dividends paid by The Weir Group PLC and this should be included with any other dividend income received when calculating and reporting total dividend income received.
It is the shareholders responsibility to include all dividend income when calculating any tax liability.
This change was announced by the Chancellor, as part of the UK government Budget, in July 2015.
If you have any tax queries, please contact a Financial Adviser.

SHAREHOLDER ALERTS Unsolicited investment advice and fraud Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.
Share scams are often run from boiler rooms where fraudsters cold-call investors offering them worthless, overpriced or even non-existent shares.
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and their activities have resulted in considerable losses for some investors.
Whilst usually by telephone, the high-pressure sales tactics can also come by email, post, word of mouth or at a seminar.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, sell your shares at a premium or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation and take a note of any other details they provide, such as a telephone number or address.
Check that the caller is properly authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA by visiting www.
Report any approach from such organisations to the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.
uk scams, where you can also find out about the latest investment scams.
You can also call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
