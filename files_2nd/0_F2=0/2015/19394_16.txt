The profit for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company is 24.7m 2014: 43.8m.

Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the Company balance sheet.
Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Taxation and deferred taxation Current tax including UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding contract to dispose of these assets, nor on unremitted earnings where there is no binding commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are not capitalised: they are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis through the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Company has not entered into any transactions involving derivative instruments.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Accounting policies continued Investments other than interests in joint ventures are recognised and derecognised on a trade date when a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Own shares held by ESOT Transactions of the Company-sponsored ESOT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Companys financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys Shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys Shareholders.
In respect of interim dividends these are recognised once paid.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Where equity settled share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is treated as a capital contribution by the Company and the investment in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
Share-based payments The Company operates a Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme, a Performance Share Plan and an Executive Share Option Scheme for senior executives, all of which involve equity-settled share-based payments.
Equity-settled share-based payments under the Executive Share Option Scheme are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The awards under the Performance Share Plan are measured at the fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the period to which the performance relates based on the expected outcome of the vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The awards under the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the period to which the performance relates.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the change will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.

Financial instruments and risk management The Company is exposed to financial risks arising from changes in interest rates.
Other financial risks are not considered significant.
Financial instruments utilised by the Company during the years ended 31May 2015 and 31May 2014, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2015 95 Current asset investments In accordance with FRS 25 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Companys balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings and current asset investments approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The financial instruments held by the Company do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash flow interest rate risk.
