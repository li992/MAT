6 Legal proceedings 7 Financial Statements 8 Glossary 9 Shareholder information 12 Intangible assets continued Crude oil and natural gas prices key assumptions for oil and gas prices were derived from forward price curves and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.
These prices were adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas, or where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
The long-term crude oil and natural gas prices used in the FVLCD determinations were either lower or within the following range of prices published by market commentators: 2015 2014 a Crude oil price US$ bbl 57.00 86.00 88.00 107.79 Natural gas price US$ MMBtu 3.54 5.80 3.84 5.84 a West Texas Intermediate WTI.
Discount rate in arriving at the FVLCD, a real post-tax discount rate of 5.5 per cent 2014: 6.0 per cent was applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
This discount rate was derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC, with appropriate adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU.
Year ended 30 June 2015 During the period the Group disposed of its interest in conventional petroleum assets in North Louisiana and unconventional gas assets in the Pecos field in the Delaware Basin resulting in an impairment to Onshore US goodwill of US$42 million.
At the time of the annual goodwill impairment test the Onshore US goodwill was US$3,526 million 2014: US$3,568 million.
Onshore US was tested for impairment after testing each of the individual CGUs that it comprises.
With the exception of Hawkville, the impairment tests for the individual CGUs indicated that no impairments or reversal of prior impairments were required.
In prior periods Black Hawk and Hawkville have been tested for impairment as a single CGU, Eagle Ford.
As a result of structural, operational, and marketing changes completed in FY2015 management has determined that Black Hawk and Hawkville represent separate CGUs.
An impairment of US$2,287 million has been recognised in relation to Hawkville and allocated to property, plant and equipment.
Refer to note 2 Exceptional items for further discussion.
The impairment test of Onshore US was performed after the Hawkville assets were written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of Onshore US was determined to be US$19,793 million and resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of US$500 million.
Following the recognition of the goodwill impairment loss, the recoverable amount of Onshore US is equal to the carrying amount.
Accordingly, any adverse movement in a key assumption would lead to further impairment.
Year ended 30 June 2014 At the time of the annual goodwill impairment test the Onshore US goodwill was US$3,568 million.
The impairment tests for individual CGUs indicated that no impairments or reversal of prior impairments were required.
The impairment test of the Onshore US group of CGUs indicated that the recoverable amount of the Onshore US group of CGUs exceeded its carrying amount by US$598 million and no impairment was required.
Other Goodwill held by other CGUs is US$248 million 2014: US$466 million.
As a result of the South32 demerger US$218 million of goodwill relating to the South32 businesses was derecognised.
The remaining goodwill represents less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2015 2014: less than one per cent.
The goodwill has been allocated across a number of CGUs in different reportable segments, with no CGU accounting for more than US$190 million of total goodwill.
