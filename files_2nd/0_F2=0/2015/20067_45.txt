In 2012 13 we had recognised specific item charges of 85m and 58m against revenue and EBITDA respectively relating to this matter.
In 2014 15 we recognised revenue and EBITDA of 128m, being the prior year impacts of ladder pricing agreements with the UK mobile operators following the Supreme Court judgment.
restructuring changes the components of the restructuring charges recognised in 2014 15, 2013 14 and 2012 13 were: people and property charges of 294m 2013 14: 217m, 2012 13: 163m principally comprising leaver costs of 237m, property exit costs and networks, products and procurement channels rationalisation charges of 21m 2013 14: 59m, 2012 13: 41m.
property rationalisation costs we recognised a 45m charge increasing onerous lease provisions relating to the rationalisation of the groups property portfolio.
Profit on disposal of property in February 2015 we disposed of a surplus building in London, Keybridge house, for a consideration of 93m resulting in a profit of 67m.
retrospective regulatory matters in August 2014 the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT handed down judgment on various appeals brought against a December 2012 Ofcom determination on the pricing of certain Ethernet products.
We disagree with the CATs judgment and have applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Ofcom had determined that BT had overcharged for certain services between 1 April 2006 and 31March 2011 and required BT to make repayments.
The CAT judged that BT should also pay interest on these amounts.
Together with a review of our regulatory risk position in relation to other historical matters, we have recognised a specific item charge of 75m.
In 2012 13 we had recognised charges of 151m and 36m against revenue and EBITDA respectively, following Ofcoms determinations on historic Ethernet pricing.
