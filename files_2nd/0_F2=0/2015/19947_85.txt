Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Share-based payments We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package.
A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.
Accounting policies The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
A corresponding increase in retained earnings is also recognised.
Fair value is measured by deducting the present value of expected dividend cash flows over the life of the awards from the share price as at the grant date.
Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return TSR, which is taken into account when calculating the fair value of the share awards.
The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafones ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, over the past five years.
The fair value of awards of non-vested shares is equal to the closing price of the Groups shares on the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not without shareholder approval exceed: a 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans: and a 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated on an all-employee basis.
Share options Vodafone Group executive plans No share options have been granted to any Directors or employees under the Companys discretionary share option plans in the year ended 31 March 2015.
There are options outstanding under the Vodafone Group 1999 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan and the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan.
These options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The vesting of some of these options was subject to satisfaction of performance conditions.
Grants made to US employees are made in respect of ADSs.
Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan The Vodafone Group 2008 Sharesave Plan enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to 250 over a three and or five year period, at the end of which they may also receive a tax free bonus.
The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Companys shares.
Share plans Vodafone Group executive plans Under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees.
The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.
Vodafone Share Incentive Plan The Vodafone Share Incentive Plan enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly purchases of up to 125 per month or 5% of salary, whichever is lower.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company provides a free matching share.
