Onshore US The Onshore US group of CGUs Onshore US comprises the Permian, Haynesville, Fayetteville, Black Hawk and Hawkville CGUs.
Onshore US comprises the natural gas and liquid reserves and resources, production wells and associated infrastructure including gathering systems and processing facilities in the Permian, Haynesville, Black Hawk, and the Hawkville areas in Texas and Louisiana US and the Fayetteville area in Arkansas US.
Onshore US is part of the Petroleum and Potash reportable segment.
The recoverable amount of Onshore US was determined based on fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD.
FVLCD was determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expressed in real terms expected to arise from the continued use of the assets life of asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account.
These cash flows were discounted using a real post-tax discount rate that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to Onshore US.
The fair value measurement is categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs used in the valuation refer to note 23 Financial risk management for explanation of the valuation hierarchy.
The determination of FVLCD was most sensitive to the following assumptions: Production volumes Crude oil prices and natural gas prices Discount rate Production volumes estimated production volumes were based on detailed data for the fields and took into account development plans for the fields established by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Production volumes are dependent on variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs and the contractual duration of the production leases.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields were computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions established by management.
The production profiles used were consistent with the resource volumes approved as part of the Groups process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
