Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual bonus 2015 award For 2015 the Company operated a cash bonus plan for the executive directors related to the achievement of profit before tax targets, health and safety targets and individual strategic and operational goals.
The achievement of the profit before tax target represented up to 80% of the maximum bonus opportunity achievable of 100% of annual basic salary other than for Mr Blackwood as noted below.
The health and safety targets were given a 10% weighting of the maximum achievable with the balance of 10% relating to individual strategic and operational goals.
As Mr Blackwood served notice of his intention to leave the Company in December 2014 he was not set any individual goals for 2015 and the profit before tax measure was therefore increased to 90% of his maximum bonus opportunity.
