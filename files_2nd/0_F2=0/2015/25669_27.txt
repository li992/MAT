76 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2015 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED i Financial instruments continued iv Financial liabilities Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Group Income Statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
v Derivative financial instruments The Group treats forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap deals it enters into as derivative financial instruments at FVTPL.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are taken through the Group Income Statement.
j Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required on settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
k Finance costs Finance costs relating to the corporate banking facility, other than set-up costs, are recognised in the year in which they are incurred.
Set-up costs are recognised over the remaining facility term.
Finance costs also include the net interest cost on retirement benefit obligations and the unwinding of discounting of provisions.
l Taxation The tax charge or credit represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Group Income Statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 77 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2015 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED m Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group subsidiary that is consolidated i. e. Service Companies are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purposes of the pro forma and statutory financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group subsidiary are expressed in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the financial statements.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency including investments measured at fair value are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any difference arising on the retranslation of these amounts is taken to the Group Income Statement with foreign exchange movements on investments measured at fair value recognised in operating income as part of net gain on investments at FVTPL.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
n Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Where a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, it is treated as a discontinued operation.
The post-tax profit or loss of this discontinued operation together with the gain or loss recognised on its disposal is shown as a single amount on the face of the Group Income Statement, with all historical financial periods being presented on this basis.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is recoverable through a sale rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is completed within one year of the date of its classification.
o Retirement benefit costs The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
Its two defined benefit pension schemes are the John Laing Pension Fund JLPF and the John Laing Pension Plan, which are both closed to future accrual.
The Group also provides post-retirement medical benefits to certain former employees.
Payments to defined contribution pension arrangements are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit pension schemes and the post-retirement medical benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at least every three years.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur and are presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Curtailment gains arising from changes to members benefits are recognised in full in the Group Income Statement.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represent the present value of: i defined benefit scheme obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and reduced by the fair value of scheme assets, where any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the schemes: and ii unfunded post-retirement medical benefits.
Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs.
p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term deposits as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are shown as other financial assets.
q Leasing All leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
r Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments on the basis that they evidence a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds in the period in which the shares are issued.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 78 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2015 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED s Employee benefit trust In June 2015, the Group established the John Laing Group Employee Benefit Trust EBT as described further in note 5.
The Group is deemed to have control of the EBT and it is therefore treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the accounts.
Any investment by the EBT in the parent companys shares is deducted from equity in the Group Balance Sheet as if they were treasury shares.
Other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group.
Any shares held by the EBT are excluded for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
The key areas of the financial statements where the Group is required to make critical judgements and material accounting estimates are in respect of the fair value of investments and accounting for the Groups defined benefit pension liabilities, including whether there is any minimum funding requirement to be recognised.
Fair value of investments A valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is prepared on a consistent, principally discounted cash flow basis at 30 June and 31 December.
The valuation excluding listed investments assumes that forecast cash flows are received until maturity of the underlying assets.
The valuation is subject to a number of material estimates including discount rates and forecast cash flows from investments in projects.
A base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points.
The base case discount rate is then adjusted to reflect project-specific risks.
In addition, risk premia are added during the construction phase to reflect the additional risks during construction.
These premia reduce over time as the project progresses through its construction programme, reflecting the significant reduction in risk once the project reaches the operating stage.
The discount rates applied to investments at 31 December 2015 were in the range of 7.3% to 12.3% 31 December 2014 7.5% to 13.0%.
The cash flows on which the discounted cash flow valuation is based are those forecast to be distributable to the Group at each balance sheet date, derived from detailed project financial models.
These incorporate assumptions about value enhancements.
Further detail on key assumptions underpinning the valuation of the investments including sensitivities can be found in note 17.
Pension and other post-retirement liability accounting The combined accounting deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes at 31 December 2015 was 46.2 million 31 December 2014 185.8 million.
The value of the pension deficit is highly dependent on key assumptions including price inflation, discount rate and life expectancy.
The assumptions applied at 31 December 2015 and the sensitivity of the pension liabilities to certain changes in these assumptions are illustrated in note 19.
In determining the Groups defined benefit pension liability, consideration is also given to whether there is a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 Limit on Defined Benefit Asset which is in excess of the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability.
If the minimum funding requirement is higher, an additional liability would need to be recognised.
Under the trust deed and rules of JLPF, the Group has an ultimate unconditional right to any surplus and accordingly the excess of the minimum funding requirement over the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability has not been recognised as an additional liability.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 79 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2015 3 OPERATING SEGMENTS Information is reported to the Groups Board the chief operating decision maker under IFRS 8 Operating Segments for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance based on the category of activities undertaken within the Group.
The principal categories of activity, and thus the reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, are: Primary Investment, Secondary Investment and Asset Management.
The results included within each of the reportable segments comprise: Primary Investment costs and cost recoveries associated with originating, bidding for and winning greenfield infrastructure and renewable energy projects: investment returns from and growth in the value of the Primary Investment portfolio, net of associated costs.
Secondary Investment investment returns from and growth in the value of the Secondary Investment portfolio, net of associated costs.
Asset Management fee income and associated costs from investment management services in respect of both the Primary and Secondary Investment portfolios and in respect of JLIFs, JLENs and JLPFs portfolios plus fee income and associated costs from project management services.
The Boards primary measure of profitability for each segment is profit before tax.
The Board has measured profitability using pro forma profit before tax, which in future years will be aligned to statutory profit before tax.

The UK Government has announced its intention to reduce the main corporation tax rate by 1% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and by a further 1% to 18% from 1 April 2020.
The Group expects that the majority of deferred tax assets will be realised after 1 April 2020 and therefore the Group has measured its deferred tax assets at 31 December 2015 at 18% 31 December 2014 20%.
11 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Certain of the Groups assets and liabilities, which relate to legacy property and construction businesses, are classified as discontinued.
The remaining assets and liabilities relate to the settlement of potential liabilities at the time of sale of the legacy businesses.
The results of discontinued operations, which have been included in the Group Income Statement, were as follows: 5.7 million income 2014 0.2 million income in administrative expenses: nil 2014 0.2 million cost in finance costs and nil 2014 0.1 million tax charge in tax.
These amounts resulted in profit from discontinued operations after tax of 5.7 million 2014 0.1 million loss.
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 is mainly due to the resolution of legacy claims.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 net cash inflow from operating activities included 1.1 million 2014 outflow 1.1 million in respect of discontinued operations.
The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations at 31 December 2015 were as follows: nil 31 December 2014 0.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and 4.2 million 31 December 2014 8.8 million of provisions.
Included within the provisions balance are provisions in relation to the legacy construction businesses for 4.2 million 31 December 2014 8.8 million.
The reduction in the provisions is mainly due to the resolution of legacy claims.

Following financial close of the East West Link project in October 2014, a change of government took place in the State of Victoria.
The incoming Labor government gave notice in December 2014 to the East West Connect consortium, in which the Group had a shareholding, that it was suspending the project.
Following agreement with the State of Victoria, the investment commitment to this project, which was made up of cash collateral of 39.7 million and a letter of credit of 21.0 million, was recovered in June 2015.

Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs to the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during either year.
There were no transfers out of Level 3.

Note 17 presents the pro forma and statutory numbers for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the pro forma numbers for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the parent company and its recourse subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by a central treasury operation which operates within Board approved policies.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk As at 31 December 2015 the Group held investments in 18 overseas projects 31 December 2014 14 overseas projects.
The Groups foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to hedge on an individual project basis but to determine and manage the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate risk on its investments is disclosed below.
In addition, the Group policy on managing foreign currency exchange rate risk is to cover significant transactional exposures arising from receipts and payments in foreign currencies, where appropriate and cost effective.
There were 15 forward currency contracts open as at 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 ten.
The fair value of these contracts was a liability of 3.7 million 31 December 2014 0.3 million asset and is included in investments at FVTPL.
At 31 December 2015, the Groups most significant currency exposure was to the Euro 31 December 2014 Euro.

As at 31 December 2015, a 10% weakening of the relevant currency against Sterling would decrease the value of investments in project companies by 36.7 million.
A 10% strengthening of the relevant currency against Sterling would increase the value by 40.4 million.
Market risk interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of returns from floating rate deposits and expose the Group to variability in interest payment cash flows on variable rate borrowings.
The Group has assessed its exposure to interest rate risk and considers that this exposure is minimal as its variable rate borrowings are short term, its finance costs in relation to letters of credit issued under the corporate banking facility are at a fixed rate and the interest earned on its cash and cash equivalents minimal.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 91 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2015 17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The exposure of the Groups financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 Pro forma and statutory Pro forma Interest bearing Non-interest Interest bearing Non-interest Floating rate bearing Total Floating rate bearing Total million million million million million million Financial assets Investments at FVTPL 965.3 965.3 858.2 858.2 Trade and other receivables 8.1 8.1 8.4 8.4 Cash and cash equivalents 1.1 1.1 2.1 2.1 Financial assets exposed to interest rate risk 1.1 973.4 974.5 2.1 866.6 868.7 An analysis of the movement between opening and closing balances of investments at FVTPL is given in note 12.
Investments in project companies are valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
At 31 December 2015, the weighted average discount rate was 9.5% 31 December 2014 9.8%.
For investments in project companies, changing the discount rate used to value the underlying instruments would alter their fair value.
As at 31 December 2015 a 1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 97.8 million 31 December 2014 77.3 million and a 1% reduction in the discount rate would increase the fair value by 116.7 million 31 December 2014 91.9 million.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 Pro forma and statutory Pro forma Interest-bearing Non-interest Interest-bearing Non-interest Fixed rate bearing Total Fixed rate bearing Total million million million million million million Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 14.9 14.9 Trade and other payables 17.6 17.6 25.3 25.3 Financial liabilities exposed to interest rate risk 14.9 17.6 32.5 25.3 25.3 Market risk inflation risk The Group has limited direct exposure to inflation risk, but the fair value of investments is determined by future project revenue and costs which can be partly linked to inflation.
Sensitivity to inflation can be mitigated by the project company entering into inflation swaps.
Where PPP investments are positively correlated to inflation, an increase in inflation expectations will tend to increase the value of PPP investments.
Conversely an increase in inflation expectations would tend to increase JLPFs pension liabilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis and arises from a combination of the value and term to settlement of balances due and payable by counterparties for both financial and trade transactions.
In order to minimise credit risk, cash investments and derivative transactions are limited to financial institutions of a suitable credit quality and counterparties are carefully screened.
The Groups cash balances are invested in line with a policy approved by the Board, capped with regard to counter-party credit ratings.
A significant majority of the project companies in which the Group invests receive revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients and or directly from the public.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to significant credit risk.
Price risk The Groups investments in PPP assets have limited direct exposure to price risk.
The fair value of many such project companies is dependent on the receipt of fixed fee income from government departments, public sector or local authority clients.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to price risk.
The Group also holds investments in renewable energy projects whose fair value may vary with forward energy prices to the extent they are not hedged through short to medium term fixed price purchase agreements with electricity suppliers, or do not benefit from governmental support mechanisms at fixed prices.
The Groups investment in JLEN is valued at its closing market share price.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its current and upcoming obligations.
The Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and assessing the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Managing liquidity risk is helped by the relative predictability in both value and timing of cash flows to and from the project companies in which the Group invests.

The Groups capital structure comprises its equity as set out in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and its net borrowings.
On 17 February 2015, the Group entered into a five year 350.0 million corporate banking facility and related ancillary facilities.
These replaced a facility of 353.9 million which was due to expire on 20 February 2017.
Issued at 31 December 2015 were letters of credit of 154.2 million 31 December 2014 243.8 million related to future capital and loan commitments and performance and bid bonds of 1.1 million 31 December 2014 1.1 million.

JLPF was closed to future accrual from 1 April 2011 and the Plan was closed to future accrual from September 2003.
Neither Scheme has any active members, only deferred members and pensioners.
The assets of both Schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
UK staff employed since 1 January 2002, who are entitled to retirement benefits, can choose to be members of a defined contribution stakeholder scheme sponsored by the Group in conjunction with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited.
Local defined contribution arrangements are available to overseas staff.
JLPF An actuarial valuation of JLPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013 by a qualified independent actuary, Towers Watson.
At that date, JLPF was 75% funded on the technical provision funding basis.
This valuation took into account the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI Bureau projections of mortality.
Under the schedule of contributions agreed at the time, John Laing agreed to contribute 26.1 million for 2014 increasing by 3.55% per annum until 2023.
Under a revision to the schedule of contributions agreed as part of the IPO, the deficit reduction contribution for 2016 will be 18.0 million increasing to 19.0 million in 2017.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of JLPF is due as at 31 March 2016.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, John Laing made deficit reduction contributions of 127.4 million 2014 26.1 million to JLPF in a mixture of cash, JLEN shares and PPP investments.
At 31 December 2015, JLPFs assets included PPP investments valued at 41.4 million 31 December 2014 7.0 million.
The Company has guaranteed to fund any cumulative shortfall in forecast project yield payments for some of the PPP investments up until 2017, but considers it unlikely that a net shortfall will arise.
The liability at 31 December 2015 allows for indexation of deferred pensions and post 5 April 1988 GMP pension increases based on the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The Plan No contributions were made to the Plan in the year ended 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 none.
At its last actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014, the Plan had assets of 12.3 million and liabilities of 11.4 million resulting in an actuarial surplus of 0.9 million.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Plan is due as at 31 March 2017.

Derivatives can be classified as Level 2 instruments and property and PPP investments as Level 3 instruments.
It is the policy of JLPF to use inflation swaps to hedge its exposure to inflation risk.
The JLPF Trustee invests in return seeking assets, such as equity, property and PPP investments, whilst balancing the risks of inflation and interest rate movements through the annuity buy-in agreement, inflation swaps and interest rate hedging.
In February 2009, the JLPF Trustee entered into a bulk annuity buy-in agreement with Aviva to mitigate JLPFs exposure to changes in liabilities.
At 31 December 2015, the underlying insurance policy was valued at 214.2 million 31 December 2014 226.3 million, being very substantially equal to the IAS 19 valuation of the related liabilities.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 106 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2015 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2015 28 DISCLOSURE SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group has investments in project companies which are disclosed within investments at FVTPL see note 12.
A number of these project companies are subject to service concession arrangements in the Social Infrastructure, Transport, and Environmental sectors.
The concessions vary as to the extent of their obligations but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concessions may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the assets may include the provision of major maintenance and facilities management services.
Typically at the end of concession periods the assets are returned to the concession owner: however, on two of the investments held at 31 December 2015 the project company has a right to retain the concession asset.
The rights of the concession owner and concession operator are stated within the project agreements.
The rights of the concession owner include provisions to terminate the concession for poor performance of the contract by the operator or in the event of force majeure.
The rights of the operator to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the operator to fulfil its requirements.
