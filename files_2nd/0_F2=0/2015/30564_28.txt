Accounting policies The principal accounting policies followed by the Company are set out below: a Basis of accounting The Company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS102 as it applies to the financial statements of the Company for the period ended 31 December 2015 and the Statement of Recommended Practice 'Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts' issued in November 2014.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting policies below.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been presented in Sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Company.
b Investments The Company has adopted the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 for measuring and disclosing its financial instruments.
"All investments held by the Company are classified as ""fair value through profit or loss"", and are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation IPEVCV guidelines, as updated in December 2012."
This classification is followed as the Company's business is to invest in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
For investments actively traded on organised financial markets, fair value is generally determined by reference to Stock Exchange market quoted bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of quoted investments are recognised on the trade date where a contract of sale exists whose terms require delivery within a time frame determined by the relevant market.
Purchases and sales of unlisted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.
Unquoted investments are a significant accounting judgement which is stated at fair value by the directors in accordance with the following rules, which are consistent with the IPEVCV guidelines: All investments are held at the price of a recent investment for an appropriate period where there is considered to have been no change in fair value.
Where such a basis is no longer considered appropriate, the following factors will be considered: i Where a value is indicated by a material arms-length transaction by an independent third party in the shares of a company, this value will be used.
ii In the absence of i, and depending upon both the subsequent trading performance and investment structure of an investee company, the valuation basis will usually move to an earnings multiple basis.
The shares may be valued by applying a suitable price-earnings ratio to that company's historic, current or forecast post-tax earnings before interest and amortisation the ratio used being based Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 73 on a comparable sector but the resulting value being adjusted to reflect points of difference identified by the Investment Adviser compared to the sector including, inter alia, a lack of marketability.
Where an earnings multiple basis is not appropriate and overriding factors apply, discounted cash flow or net asset valuation bases may be applied.
c Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss to capital or revenue in the income statement as appropriate.
Foreign exchange movements on investments are included in the income statement within gains on investments.
d Income Investment income has been accounted for on an ex-dividend basis or when the Companys right to the income is established.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue in the income statement, according to the circumstances surrounding the payment of the dividend.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Interest receivable on deposits is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: Any performance fee is allocated to capital Investment transactions costs are allocated to capital Other expenses are charged wholly to revenue Direct issue costs are deducted from the share premium account.
f Taxation The charge for taxation is based upon the net revenue for the year.
The tax charge is allocated to the revenue and capital accounts according to the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are first matched against taxable income arising in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation will be recognised as an asset or a liability if transactions have occurred at the reporting date that give rise to an obligation to pay more taxation in the future, or a right to pay less taxation in the future.
An asset will only be recognised to the extent that it is probable to be recovered.

Portfolio management fee Period ended 31 December 2015 000 Performance fee accrual: 100% charged to capital 0 0 The portfolio manager is entitled to receive a performance fee equal to 15% of any excess returns over a cumulative 10% per annum hurdle rate, subject to a high watermark.
The performance fee is calculated on the following basis.
Where: PF is the performance fee, if any, payable to the portfolio manager A is the adjusted NAV per ordinary share B is the higher of: i the high watermark NAV per ordinary share and ii the hurdle C is the time weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue since the last performance period in respect of which a performance fee was earned, or if no performance fee has yet been earned, admission In the event that AB is a negative number, it shall be taken to equal zero.
For these purposes: Performance period means: i the period beginning on the date of admission and ending on 31 December 2015 and ii each subsequent period corresponding to each accounting period of the Company.
Adjusted NAV per ordinary share means the net asset value per ordinary share on the last business day of each performance period, adjusted by adding back any performance fee accrual in respect of such performance period.
High watermark NAV per ordinary share means the net asset value per ordinary share as at the last business day of the performance period in respect of which a performance fee was last earned, adding back the effect of any performance fee paid in respect of such performance period or, if no performance fee has yet been earned, the issue price.
Hurdle means the issue price increased, from admission, at a rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually as at the last business day of each performance period pro-rated, in the case of the first performance period, from the date of admission.
The high watermark NAV per ordinary share and the hurdle will be adjusted to reflect the impact on the adjusted NAV per ordinary share from a capital return and or dividend and or distribution to shareholders at the time of such capital return and or dividend and or distribution, on a pence per ordinary share basis.
If at any time a potential adjustment event shall occur, the portfolio manager and the Company will discuss in good faith what adjustment would be appropriate for the purpose of calculation of the performance fee.
Failing such agreement, the Company will instruct the auditor, or other independent firm of accountants, to report to the Company and the portfolio manager regarding any adjustment which in the opinion of the auditor, or other independent firm of accountants, shall be appropriate to be made for the purpose of the calculation of the performance fee.
Potential adjustment event means, in relation to the Company, every issue by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves and every issue by way of rights or bonus and every consolidation or sub-division or reduction of capital or share premium or capital dividend or redemption of ordinary shares, or other reconstruction or adjustment relating to the share capital of the Company or any shares, stock or securities derived therefrom or convertible thereinto and also includes any other amalgamation or reconstruction affecting the share capital of the Company or any shares, stock or securities derived therefrom or convertible thereinto.

Taxation a Analysis of charge in the period: Period ended Period ended Period ended 31 December 2015 31 December 2015 31 December 2015 Revenue Capital Total '000 '000 '000 Overseas tax 0 0 0 --------- --------- --------- Total tax charge for the year see note 7 b 0 0 0 76 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year: The tax assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for a large company of 20.19%.
The differences are explained below: Period ended Period ended Period ended 31 December 2015 31 December 2015 31 December 2015 Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 Total return before taxation 1,538 17,587 16,049 UK corporation tax at 20.19% 311 3,551 3,240 Effects of: Capital gains losses not subject to corporation tax 0 3,551 3,551 UK dividends which are not taxable 468 0 468 Overseas tax suffered 0 0 0 Non-taxable overseas dividends 0 0 0 Movement in unutilised management expenses 157 0 157 Total tax charge 0 0 0 The Company is not liable to tax on capital gains due to its status as an investment trust.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
After claiming relief against accrued income taxable on receipt, the Company has a deferred tax asset of approximately 140,191 relating to excess management expenses of 778,836.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has been recognised.

Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives stated on pages 22 to 24.
In pursuing its investment objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The Companys financial instruments comprise securities in unquoted and quoted companies, trade receivables, trade payables and cash.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk see b below, interest rate risk see c below and other price risk see d below.
The Board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Companys investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
b Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling the Companys functional currency, in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
The investment manager monitors the Companys exposures and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is includedin the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposures An analysis of the Companys equity investments and liabilities at 31 December 2015 shown at fair value, except derivatives at gross exposure value that are priced in a foreign currency based on the country of primary exposure are shown below.
As at 31 December 2015 Euro Investments Net financial assets Equity investments 000 000 000 Euro 15,204 16,547 1,343 Norwegian Krone 23,282 23,282 Swiss Francs 10,370 10,370 US Dollar 141,544 141,544 Total 15,204 191,743 176,539 Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the period and the equity in regard to the Company's non-monetary financial assets to changes in the exchange rates for the portfolio's significant currency exposure being Sterling US Dollar.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US Dollar - 2% These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the period.
82 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc If Sterling had strengthened against the US Dollar, this would have had the following effect: As at 31 December 2015 US Dollar '000 Projected change 2% Impact on capital return 2,831 Return after taxation for the period 2,831 If Sterling had weakened against the US Dollar, this would have had the following effect: As at 31 December 2015 US Dollar '000 Projected change 2% Impact on capital return 2,831 Return after taxation for the period 2,831 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the period as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Company's objectives.
c Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk specifically through its cash holdings.
Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from any cash at bank and on deposits.
The effect of interest rate changes on the earnings of the companies held within the portfolio may have a significant impact on the valuation of the Companys investments.
The Company does not have any fixed rate exposure at 31 December 2015.
Due to the insignificant impact of fluctuations in interest rates no sensitivity analysis is shown.
d Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Company is exposed to market price risk arising from its equity investments.
The movements in the prices of these investments result in movements in the performance of the Company.
The Board of directors manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the investment manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the investment managers compliance with the Companys objectives.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A sector breakdown and geographical allocation of the portfolio is contained in the portfolio on pages 18 to 19.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year to an increase or decrease of 10% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 83 Increase in Decrease in fair value fair value 2015 2015 '000 '000 Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Capital return increase decrease 79,693 79,693 Return after taxation other than arising from interest rate or currency risk increase decrease 79,693 79,693 e Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk exposure The Companys assets comprise quoted and unquoted equity shares.
Whilst the unquoted equity is intentionally illiquid, the quoted assets comprise of readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the assets of the Company are subject to special liquidity arrangements.
The investment in unquoted securities may have limited liquidity and be difficult to realise.
At 31 December 2015 the unquoted securities are valued at 289,662,000. f Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The cash is subject to counterparty credit risk as the Companys access to its cash could be delayed should the counterparties become insolvent or bankrupt.
In summary, the exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2015 was as follows: 2015 3 months or less '000 Cash at bank 12,008 Debtors 326 Total 12,334 None of the above assets were impaired or past due but not impaired.
Investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the investment manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with highquality external credit ratings.
84 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc g Fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities The financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, due to brokers, accruals and cash balances.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note 2 b on page 73.
The table below sets out fair value measurements using fair value hierarchy.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss At 31 December 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: 000 000 000 Equity investments 507,267 289,662 796,929 Total 507,267 289,662 796,929 Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset see note 9 for details.
The change in fair value for the current year is recognised through the income statement.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss At 31 December 2015 Note Level 1 Total Liabilities 000 000 Derivative financial liabilities 12 368 368 Total 368 368 Categorisation within the liabilities has been determined on the basis of level input 1 that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant liability see note 9 for details.
h Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are: To ensure that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern To deliver a return in excess of 10% per annum over the longer term.
As the Company does not intend to deploy long-term gearing this is primarily to be achieved through equity capital.
The Company's total capital at 31 December 2015 was 805,264,000.
Segmental analysis There is only one class of business and the operations of the Company are wholly in the United Kingdom.
