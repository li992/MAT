FINANCIAL RISK Risk Management Objectives and Risk Policies The Group seeks to manage risk through the operation of unit linked business whereby the policyholder bears the financial risk.
In addition, shareholder assets are invested in liquid investments with a strong credit rating.
Under IFRS 7, the Group is required to analyse their exposure to the following risks: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk Currency risk ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Registered No.
03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 149 Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtors non-payment of a loan or other line of credit.
Credit risk also arises from holdings of cash and cash equivalents, deposits and formal loans with banks and financial institutions.
The Group has adopted a risk averse approach to such risk and has a stated policy of not actively pursuing or accepting credit risk except when necessary to support other objectives.
RISK DESCRIPTION MANAGEMENT Shareholders Loss of assets Shareholder funds are predominantly invested in AAA rated unitised money assets market funds and deposits with approved banks.
Maximum counterparty limits are set for each Company within the Group and aggregate limits are also set at a Group level.
Investment Loss of value of assets These liabilities are matched by fixed interest securities with minimum AAA matching of credit ratings or UK Government Gilts: maximum counterparty limits for such non-linked holdings are again set for each Company within the Group and at an aggregate liabilities Group level.
Reinsurance Failure of counterparty or Credit ratings of potential reinsurers must meet or exceed minimum specified counterparty unable to meet levels.
Consideration is also given to size, risk concentrations exposures and liabilities ownership in the selection of reinsurers.
The Group also seeks to diversify its reinsurance credit risk through the use of a spread of reinsurers.
Partner loans Inability of Partners to repay Loans and advances are managed in line with the Groups secured lending policy.
and advances loans or advances from Loans are secured on the future renewal income stream expected from a St. Jamess Place Partners portfolio and loan advances vary in relation to the projected future income of the relevant Partner.
Outstanding balances are regularly reviewed and assessed on a conservative basis.
Support is provided to help Partners manage their business appropriately.
Appropriate provision is made where there is objective evidence of impairment.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost.
The Group is averse to liquidity risk and seeks to minimise this risk by not actively pursuing it except where necessary to support other objectives.
RISK DESCRIPTION MANAGEMENT Cash or expense A significant cash or expense The majority of free assets are invested in cash or cash equivalents and the cash requirement requirement needs to be met position and forecast are monitored on a monthly basis.
Also, the Group at short notice.
maintains a margin of free assets in excess of the minimum required solvency capital within its regulated entities.

FINANCIAL RISK continued Market risk is the impact a fall in the value of equity or other asset markets may have on the business.
The Group adopts a risk averse approach to market risk, with a stated solvency policy of not actively pursuing or accepting market risk except where necessary to support other objectives.
However, the Group accepts the risk that the fall in equity or other asset markets will reduce the level of annual management charge income derived from policyholder assets and the risk of lower future profits.
The table below summarises the main market risks that the business is exposed to and the methods by which the Group seeks to mitigate them.
RISK DESCRIPTION MANAGEMENT Client liabilities As a result of a reduction in This risk is substantially mitigated by the Groups strategic focus on unit-linked equity values, the Group may business, by not providing guarantees to clients on policy values and by the be unable to meet client matching of assets and liabilities.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 155 The Group closely monitors the valuation of assets in markets that have become less liquid.
Determining whether a market is active requires the exercise of judgement and is determined based upon the facts and circumstances of the market for the instrument being measured.
Where it is determined that there is no active market, fair value is established using a valuation technique.
The techniques applied incorporate relevant information available and reflect appropriate adjustments for credit and liquidity risks.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The relative weightings given to differing sources of information and the determination of non-observable inputs to valuation models can require the exercise of significant judgement.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Note that all of the resulting fair value estimates are included in Level 2, except for certain equities and investments in Collective Investment Schemes CIS and investment properties as detailed below.
Specific valuation techniques used to value Level 2 financial assets and liabilities include: The use of observable prices for identical current arms length transactions.
Specific valuation techniques used to value Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include: The use of unobservable inputs, such as expected rental values and equivalent yields: Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow and historic lapse rates, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 Portfolios Transfers out of Level 3 portfolios arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instruments valuation become market observable: conversely, transfers into the portfolios arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.
Transfers in of certain equities and investments in Collective Investment Schemes CIS occur when asset valuations can no longer be obtained from an observable market price i. e. become illiquid, in liquidation, suspended etc.
The converse is true if an observable market price becomes available.
During 2015, 0.3 million relating to CIS was transferred into the Level 3 portfolio.
During 2014, 28.7 million relating to CIS and 5.9 million relating to a reclassification within other receivables were transferred into the Level 3 portfolio.
The following table presents the changes in Level 3 financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss: 2015 2014 Million Million Opening balance 1,090.4 750.6 Transfer into Level 3 0.3 34.6 Additions during the year 255.2 268.5 Disposed during the year 41.7 46.3 Gains recognised in the income statement 70.2 83.0 Closing balance 1,374.4 1,090.4 Total gains included in the statement of comprehensive income for assets held at the end of the reporting year: 2015 2014 Million Million Realised losses 5.8 4.7 Unrealised gains 76.0 87.7 Gains recognised in the income statement 70.2 83.0 ST.

FINANCIAL RISK continued Additions include 253.8 million of investment properties and 1.4 million of renewal income.
Gains recognised in the statement of comprehensive income are included within investment return for certain equities and investments in CIS and investment property, and within administration expenses for the renewal income.
The principal assets classified as Level 3 are investment properties amounting to 1,344.9 million 2014: 1,031.4 million.
Investment property is valued monthly by external chartered surveyors in accordance with the guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The investment property valuation has been prepared using the market approach valuation technique using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable i. e. similar assets.
The following table sets out the unobservable inputs utilised in the valuation of the investment properties: Investment property classification 31 December 2015 Office Industrial Retail & leisure All Gross ERV per sq ft Range 14.75 90.01 3.00 15.00 5.00 365.46 3.00 365.46 Weighted average 30.18 6.59 14.73 13.22 True equivalent yield Range 3.7% 8.0% 5.4% 7.1% 4.7% 13.1% 3.7% 13.1% Weighted average 5.4% 6.1% 6.0% 5.8% 31 December 2014 Gross ERV per sq ft Range 14.75 92.51 3.00 15.00 5.30 350.39 3.00 350.39 Weighted average 28.04 6.25 15.67 11.96 True equivalent yield Range 3.8% 8.0% 5.7% 8.0% 4.3% 13.3% 3.8% 13.3% Weighted average 5.7% 6.6% 6.1% 6.1% Equivalent rental value per square foot Sensitivity of Level 3 Valuations The valuation of certain equities and investments in CIS are based on the latest observable price available.
Whilst such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing the price applied to a reasonably possible alternative would not change the fair value significantly.
The valuation of renewal income is based on discounted cash flows and historic lapse rates.
The effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions of a movement of 100bps on the discount rate and a 10% movement in the lapse rate would result in an unfavourable change in valuation of 3.0 million and a favourable change in valuation of 3.6 million, respectively.
The following table sets out the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions to the valuation of the investment properties.
Any change in the value of investment property is matched by the associated movement in the policyholder liability and therefore would not impact on the shareholder net assets.

FINANCIAL RISK continued Financial Assets that are Either Past Due or Impaired Loans to St. Jamess Place Partnership of 178.7 million 2014: 158.9 million are net of an impairment provision of 3.0 million 2014: 2.9 million see Note 16.
The value of the loans that are past due but not impaired is not considered to be material and has therefore not been aged.
The factors considered in determining the impairment include default history, the nature or type of the Partner loan, exposure levels to individual Partners and whether the individual Partner is active or has left.
The movement in the impairment provision will reflect utilisation of the existing provision during the year, but the overall cost of impaired loans including new provisions recognised within administration expenses in the statement of comprehensive income during the year was a charge of 1.4 million 2014: 0.9million.
There are no other financial assets that are impaired, would originally have been past due or impaired but whose terms have been renegotiated, or are past due but not impaired.

In practice the contractual maturities of the assets may be longer than one year, but the majority of assets held within the unit linked and unit trust funds are highly liquid and the Group also actively monitors fund liquidity.
Sensitivity Analysis to Market Risks The majority of the Groups business is unit linked and the direct associated market risk is therefore borne by policyholders although there is a secondary impact as shareholder income is dependent upon the markets.
Financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds primarily consist of fixed interest securities, units in money market funds, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets and liabilities.
The fixed interest securities are held to match non linked liabilities and the liability values move broadly in line with the matching asset values such that fair value interest rate risk is immaterial, although there is some residual risk due to imperfect matching.
Cash held in unitised money market funds and at bank is valued at par and is unaffected by movement in interest rates.
Other assets and liabilities are similarly unaffected by market movements.
As a result of these combined factors, the Groups financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds are not materially subject to market risk, and movements at the reporting date in interest rates and equity values have an immaterial impact on the Groups profit after tax and equity.
Future profits from annual management charges may be affected by movements in interest rates and equity values.
