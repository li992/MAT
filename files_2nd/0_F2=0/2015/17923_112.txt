25 Estimated value range of equity awards The current face value of STI and LTI awards allocated during FY2015 and yet to vest to be disclosed under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 is the number of awards as set out in the previous tables multiplied by the current share price of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc as applicable.
The actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on, and therefore fluctuates with, the share prices of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc at the date that any particular award is exercised.

26 Awards of Matched Shares under the Shareplus all-employee share purchase plan Like all permanent employees, members of the GMC are eligible to participate in Shareplus, an all-employee share purchase plan.
For administrative simplicity in regard to stock exchange dealings and announcements, no GMC members currently participate.
Shareplus holdings previously accumulated by members of the GMC, including during the period before they joined the GMC are detailed below.
Participants in Shareplus contribute from their post-tax base salary capped at US$5,000 per year to acquire shares in BHP Billiton Limited or in BHP Billiton Plc.
For each share purchased, the participant receives a right to acquire a Matched Share, which vests provided the participant remains employed by BHP Billiton on the third anniversary of the start of the relevant Shareplus Plan Year.
Differences in exchange rates in relation to the base salaries of the participants in previous financial years and the currencies of each securities exchange result in minor differences in the numbers of shares allocated.
