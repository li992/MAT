In May 2006 the company placed US$250 million at xed rates for periods between eight and 12 years, in 2014 US$50 million of this debt was repaid.
In December 2009 the company undertook a further placement of US$259 million at xed rates for periods between seven and 12 years.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the companys foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash ow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge, this swap was repaid in 2014.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as fair value hedges.
The xed interest rate cross-currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
During the year in accordance with group policy, the company entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts on behalf of related undertakings for the purchase of US dollars in the future at xed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
