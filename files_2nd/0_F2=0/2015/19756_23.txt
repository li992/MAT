The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and investments.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest million, because that is the currency of the principal economic environment in which the Group operates.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and entities which are joint ventures accounted for using the equity method made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the date on which control passed to or was relinquished bythe Group.
Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and the results of joint ventures to bring accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Details of the considerations undertaken by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on page 14 within the Chief Financial Officers Statement.
Accounting policies The Groups principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
This section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, whether these are effective in the current or later years.
In both cases it is explained how they are expected to impact the performance of the Group.
Revenue Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales-related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic benefit generated from the provision of fixed line, TV and mobile telecommunications services.
All such revenue is recognised as the services are provided: line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates: voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate: usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service: promotional discounts and credits are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period subject to an adjustment for in-contract churn: and data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as the Group fulfils its performance obligations.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
When the Group sells a number of products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element based on their relative fair values.
Management applies judgement in determining the amount of revenue the Group recognises for delivered elements.
This is limited to the amounts billedforthat element.
Subscriber acquisition costs Subscriber acquisition costs include both third party costs of recruiting and retaining new customers as well as device costs.
These are expensed as incurred.
Foreign currency translation and transactions Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates thus obtained.
Unhedged transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement has been applied in the current and preceding financial year by marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss through other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges.
The principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are as follows: Average Closing 2015 2014 2015 2014 Euro 1.29 1.19 1.38 1.21 United States Dollar 1.61 1.60 1.49 1.67 60 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued Leases Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, even where payments are not made on such a basis.
Lease incentives and rent free periods are amortised through the income statement over the period of the lease term.
Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that the rentals are considered to be above or below market rentals.
The remaining gain or loss is recognised within operating expenses in the year in which the sale is completed.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Occasionally, the Group enters into agreements with certain suppliers for rebates on the cost of goods purchased.
Judgement is applied by management inthese circumstances to ensure that the rebate is recognised over the appropriate financial period.
Rebates from suppliers in the year related to renegotiated contract rates and compensation received under existing contracts.
Where these amounts relate to historical transactions, but negotiated in the current year, they are recognised in the current year income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits consist of cash in hand.
Trade payables Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Loans and other borrowings Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, US Private Placement notes and bank overdrafts.
These are initially measured at net proceeds and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant facility.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.
Shares in the Company held by the Group ESOT are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the framework approved by the Board, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income statement.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.
61 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2015 1.
Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.
The Group designates these as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Measurement The financial instruments included on the Group balance sheet are measured at fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below: Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.
Whilst every effort ismade to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have a material impact.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out in more detail inthe related notes: rebates receivable from suppliers note 1 : revenue recognition for bundled transactions note 1 : taxation note 7 : exceptional items note 9 : impairment of goodwill note 11 : valuation of acquisition intangibles note 11 : capitalisation and useful economic lives of assets notes 11 and 12 : impairment of assets notes 11 and 12 : and trade receivables note 16.
Application of significant new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, IAS16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, IAS 38 Intangible Assets and IAS 40 Investment Property became effective in the current reporting period.
These new and revised standards and interpretations have no material impact on the Group.
Future accounting developments At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there were a number of significant standards and interpretations that have not been applied in these financial statements, these were in issue, but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU.
The Directors expect that the following standards will have material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, impacting both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, impacting revenue recognition, related costs and disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.

Segmental reporting Accounting policy IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how to allocate resources.
The Group has identified the Board as its chief operating decision maker.
The Board considers the results of the business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about the allocation of resources.
Accordingly the Group has one operating segment.

Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Executive Directors.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal, non-market performance criteria for example, EPS targets and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria for example, TSRtargets.
For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately.
If a scheme is forfeited, no further expense isrecognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.
Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long term incentive plans.
To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans.
Charges are also recognised on loans provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities.
To the extent to which the loans are not, incertain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.

vii Share Match The Group launched its first all-employee, HMRC approved Share Match Plan SIP in June 2014, following the Remuneration Committee approval of this scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014.
This enables eligible employees to purchase market priced shares by entering into a partnership share agreement and holding such shares in trust for up to a five year period.
The rules of the Plan allow an employee maximum contribution of 1,800 per annum, or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased.
Approval for the TTG Share Match was granted by shareholders at the AGM on 24 July 2013.
The Remuneration Committee, at its discretion may award matching and or free shares to eligible participants.
Matching shares may be granted up to a maximum ratio of two matching shares for each partnership share purchased by a participant.
Free shares may be awarded up to a maximum value of 3,600 tax free per annum, or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased.
Currently the Group provides one matching share for each partnership share purchased by participating employees or Executive Directors.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the impact of Share Match scheme on the Groups results was not material.

Finance income and costs Finance costs are analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Interest on bank loans and overdrafts 17 16 Facility fees and similar charges 5 4 22 20 During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group refinanced its term loan and revolving credit facility with bank debt and US Private Placement notes and paid 5m in respect of arrangement and legal fees.
The fees are being amortised over the expected life of the loan and notes and are included within facility fees and similar charges above, along with the accelerated amortisation of the arrangement fees on the previous re-financing.
The average interest rate in the year was 3.00% 2014: 3.39%.
Taxation Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits.
Deferred tax isdetermined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions fortheforeseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

During the year, the Company reviewed the period over which it recognises assets in respect of brought forward tax losses and revised this from five years toten years due to the increased stability of the TV proposition.
The incremental movement of 29m has been recognised through exceptional items.
At 31 March 2015, the Group had unused tax losses of 674m 2014: 702m available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset of 69m 2014: 39m has been recognised in respect of 347m 2014: 197m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 327m 2014: 505m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information Headline information is provided because the Directors consider that it provides assistance in understanding the Groups underlying performance.
Accounting policy Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off or non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of underlying performance and should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore judgement is required to determine whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above.
Determining whether an item is exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making itdistinct from the Groups other critical accounting judgements where the basis for judgement is estimation.

Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured atcost less any accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The Group has two CGUs Consumer and TalkTalk Business.
For the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
Thevalue in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates touse to calculate present values.
Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired: thisreview is performed at a CGU level.
Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates.
The future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board approved five-year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years based on the UKs long term growth rate.
This is discounted by the CGUs weighted average cost of capital pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU.
Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment loss is recognised inthe income statement and is not subsequently reversed.

2015 2014 m m Opening cost and net book value 479 479 Acquisitions note 13 11 Closing cost and net book value 490 479 The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Consumer 348 337 TalkTalk Business 142 142 490 479 Impairment review The key assumptions used in the Groups goodwill impairment review are as follows: Long term growth rates Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD.
The rate applied in the current year was 2.2% 2014: 1.7%.
Discount rate The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten-year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk of the CGU.
The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.0% 2014: 8.4%.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs discount rate are benchmarked to externally available data.
The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the similarity of risk factors and geographical location.
Capital expenditure Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the network and current run rate of expenditure, typically at 6% of revenue.
Customer factors The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth rates, ARPU, direct costs including acquisition costs, and change in product mix.
The value assigned to each of these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group and external information on expected trends of future market developments.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
b Other intangible assets Accounting policy Operating intangibles Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for internal use.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be measured reliably.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.
Acquisition intangibles Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six years on a straight line basis.
The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for contributory assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets continued Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy Impairment At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.
Determining whether the carrying amounts of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of impairment requires judgement.
Ifan indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amounts can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.
Useful economic lives The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.
Impairment of assets The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the assets recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced toits recoverable amount.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued b Other intangible assets continued Operating intangibles Operating intangibles includes internally generated assets with a net book value of 59m 2014: 39m, which are amortised over a period of up to eight years.
This includes additions of 31m 2014: 15m and an amortisation charge of 10m 2014: 7m in the year ended 31 March 2015.
Included within operating intangibles is the following asset, which is material to the Group: TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of 66m 2014: 76m.
TRIO is amortised over a period of up to eight years depending on the release date of the relevant component.
The weighted average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO isthree years 2014: four years.
Acquisition intangibles At 31 March 2015, the acquisition intangibles relate to the broadband customer bases acquired from Virgin Media and Tesco in October 2014 and January 2015 respectively see note 13.
The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.
The value of these broadband customer bases is material to the Group with net book value of 38m.
The useful economic life of acquired customer bases is five years from the date of acquisition.
The remaining 4m of acquisition intangibles relate to the website acquired as part of the blinkbox transaction in January 2015 see note 13.
The website is valued using replacement method and has a remaining useful economic life of three years.
Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life from the date it is brought into use, as follows: Short leasehold improvements 10% or the lease term if less than ten years Network equipment and computer hardware 12.550% per annum Fixtures and fittings 2025% per annum Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based onthe useful economic life selected.
Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU to which the asset is allocated.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates to use tocalculate present values note 11.

Interest in joint ventures Accounting policy Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group income statement includes the Groups share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the year.
In the Group balance sheet, the Groups interest in joint ventures is shown as a non-current asset, representing the Groups investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets or liabilities less provision forany impairment.
In addition to the carrying amount of the investment, the Groups interest in joint ventures includes, where applicable, any long term interests in the venture that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the joint venture.
An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an extension of the Groups interest in that joint venture.
Any loans advanced to a joint venture that, in substance, do not form part of the Groups net investment are shown separately in the balance sheet, as a receivable to the Group.
Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the Groups investment in ordinary shares are applied tothe other components of the Groups interest in the joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority i. e. priority in liquidation.

A provision is made for obsolete items where appropriate.
Trade and other receivables Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy Judgement is required in order to evaluate the likelihood of collection of customer debt after revenue has been recognised and hence the value of the bad and doubtful debt.
These provisions are based on historical trends in the percentage of debts which are not recovered.

Bank overdrafts Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management: these uncommitted facilities bear interest at a margin over the BankofEngland base rate.
$185m US Private Placement USPP Notes In July 2014 the Group issued $185m of USPP notes maturing in 3 tranches $139m 2021, $25m 2024, $21m 2026.
The interest rate payable onthe notes is at a margin over US treasury rate for the appropriate period.
The USPP proceeds were swapped to 109m 82m 2021, 15m 2024, 12m 2026 and the net debt includes retranslation of the USPP funds at the rates achieved where hedged by cross currency swaps.
560m revolving credit facility RCF and 50m bilateral agreement The Group has a 560m RCF, which matures in July 2019.
The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin overLIBOR and for the appropriate period.
The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
In addition to the RCF, the Group also has a 50m bilateral agreement which matures in July2019.
100m term loan The Group has a committed term loan of 100m 2014: 75m, with a final maturity date of July 2019.
This loan amortises over the term withrepayments due of 25m in January 2017, 25m in January 2018 and the remainder in July 2019.
The interest rate payable in respect ofdrawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period.
The Groups facilities total 819m excluding the translation impact.
The financial covenants included in each facility are identical: they restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover.
The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior year.
Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the end of the year, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, as follows: 2015 2014 Maturity m m Undrawn available committed facilities 2019 220 175 The book value and fair value of the Groups loans and other borrowings, all of which are in Sterling, are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Less than 1 year 37 1 to 2 years 25 460 2 to 3 years 25 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years 440 Greater than 5 years 109 599 497 83 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2015 19.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments The book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments, excluding the Groups loans and other borrowings shown in note 18, are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 10 Trade and other receivables 312 260 Derivative financial instruments 11 Non-current assets Non-current investments and investment in joint venture 10 7 Current liabilities Bank overdrafts 7 Trade and other payables 516 456 173 196 Derivative financial instruments are included with other receivables in note 16.
Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities above so as to give completeness over the Groups contractual commitments on future cash outflows.
a Financial instruments The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk such as currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group Treasury function uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance from these risks.
These financial instruments primarily consist of bank loans and interest rate swaps.
Other products, such as currency options, can also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding financial year.
The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
The Group has cash flow hedges in place to a swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from floating to fixed and b swap the currency and interest rate risk on the USPP debt from USD to GBP and from fixed US Treasury interest rates to fixed GBP interest rates.
These hedges have been fully effective from inception.
The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 FY14: Level 2, derived from other observable market data: this means that their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date.
Fair value measurement at Level 2 gives consideration to interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at commonly quoted intervals for relevant currencies.
The Group has also assessed the credit risk within its financial instruments.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2015 is11m 2014: nil.
A loss of 5m 2014: gain of 3m has been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2015.
As the hedges were fully effective there has been no income statement impact.
b Embedded derivatives No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar.
The Group also uses cross currency swaps to hedge its US Dollar denominated borrowings US Private Placement.
At 31 March 2015 the adjustment to translate our net debt to Sterling at swap rates to reflect the impact of hedging was 16m 2014: nil.
Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates: this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates.
There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK Sterling Euro exchange rate on either the income statement or other equity.
The effect of foreign exchange derivatives onborrowings at the year-end was as follows: UK Sterling Euro USD Total m m m m 2015 Borrowings before derivatives 490 125 615 Derivatives 16 16 490 109 599 UK Sterling Euro Other Total m m m m 2014 Borrowings before derivatives 497 497 Derivatives 7 10 3 490 10 3 497 During the year, the Group used derivatives for the management of US private placement debt, foreign currency cash balances and foreign currency trading balances.
84 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2015 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19.
Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued d Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover.
As detailed insection a, the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed inthe table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated.
Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating these sensitivities.
This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year-end positions prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.
2015 2014 m m 1% movement in the UK Sterling interest rate Income statement movement 3 3 e Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it.
Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing bank debt facilities do not expire until July 2019, USPP debt matures in three tranches July 2021, 2024 and 2026: it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows assuming year-end interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.

Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks all of which have short or long term credit ratings appropriate to the Groups exposures.
Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from Consumer and TalkTalk Business fixed line customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered tobe irrecoverable.

Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued g Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return tostakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.
The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an annual basis.
