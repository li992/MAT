EPRA earnings is the profit after tax excluding investment and development property revaluations and gains or losses on disposals, changes in the fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation.
A summary of the EPRA Performance Measures is provided in Table B within the Supplementary Disclosures, see page 175.
The EPRA earnings per share diluted also takes into account dilution due to the convertible bond issued on 10 September 2012.
The Companys share price reached the conversion price of the convertible bond for the first time in the year to 31 March 2015 and therefore was dilutive for the first time in the year.
Underlying earnings consists of the EPRA earnings diluted measure, excluding the dilutive impact of the convertible bond.
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the year was: basic: 1,016m 2013 14: 999m : diluted for the effect of share options: 1,022m 2013 14: 1,004m : and the convertible bond: 1,080m 2013 14: 1,004m.

The EPRA NAV per share calculation also takes into account dilution for the convertible bond issued on 10 September 2012.
During the year ended 31March 2015, the Companys share price reached the conversion price of the convertible bond for the first time and therefore it was dilutive at the year end.
At 31 March 2015, the number of shares in issues was: basic: 1,020m 2013 14: 1,008m : diluted for the effect of share options and the convertible bond: 1,090m 2013 14: 1,021m.

The Company expenses an estimate of how many shares are likely to vest based on the market price at the date of grant, taking account of expected performance against the relevant performance targets and service periods.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP the Company may award employees a combination of performance shares and options.
Both components have the same performance targets based on total property return, total accounting return and a three-year service period.
For both LTIP components the Company estimates the number of shares or options likely to vest and expenses that estimate over the relevant period.
Performance shares are valued at the market value at the date of the award.
The options are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends see table below.
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price over a four-year period and adjusting where there are known factors that may affect future volatility.
No other features of the option grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

The Company expenses the estimated number of shares likely to vest over the three-year period based on the market price at the date of grant.
Fund Managers Performance Plan FMPP Under the FMPP the Company may award employees a combination of cash 20% of the award and shares based on a maximum of 30% of the annual performance fee awarded by the Unit Trusts and, as agreed by shareholders in 2008, in respect of a comparative notional pool for British Land owned portfolios.
The cash is awarded following the performance year under review with the shares released over the following three years, subject to clawback due to subsequent property underperformance.
The Company expenses an estimate of the fair value of the award over the period to full vesting.
No further grants under the FMPP were made in the year.
Other share plans Under the SIP the Company gives eligible employees free shares of up to 3,600 a year.
They can also purchase partnership shares for up to 1,800 a year that are matched two-for-one by the Company.
The free and matching shares are either purchased at fair value in the market or allotted and expensed at the time of allocation.
Under the savings related share option scheme, eligible employees can save up to 500 a month over a three or five-year period and use the savings to exercise an option granted at the outset at a 20% discount to the then prevailing share price.
The fair value of the various options is expensed over the service period, based on a Black-Scholes model.
Movements in shares and options are given in note 22.
10 Pensions The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal pension scheme in the Group.
It is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and not contracted out of SERPS State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
Existing entitlements will be retained by the members, with freedom to transfer to a new Defined Contribution Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary and paid by the Company.
In certain circumstances it may be necessary to pay higher contributions when recruiting senior executives.
The Group has three other small pension schemes.
The total net pension cost charged for the year was 6m 2013 14: 6m, of which 3m 2013 14: 3m relates to defined contribution plans and 3m 2013 14: 3m relates to the current service cost of the defined benefit schemes.
136 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 10 Pensions continued A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 by consulting actuaries, AON Hewitt Associates Ltd.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 54.4% per annum of basic salaries.
The best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2016 is 3m.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 3.1% 4.4 4.1 4.6 5.5 Salary inflation 4.8% 5.2 4.7 4.7 5.2 Pensions increase 3.2% 3.5 3.1 3.1 3.7 Price inflation 3.3% 3.7 3.2 3.2 3.7 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 29.8 years if they are male and for a further 31.0 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2035 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 31.4 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 32.7 years after retirement if they are female.

Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
Asset volatility T he liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with a reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which, though are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A d ecrease in corporate bond yields will in crease the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
These levels are specified in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
On the following page of this note within the section Valuation our property valuation approach and process is set out.
As noted in the Report of the Audit Committee on page 80, property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
The inputs to the valuations are defined as unobservable by IFRS 13 and these are analysed in a table on the following page.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There have been no transfers during the period.
The historical cost of properties was 6,582m 2013 14: 5,574m.
The property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases 2013 14: nil.
Properties valued at 2,479m 2013 14: 1,741m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to 1,365m 2013 14: 1,066m.
Included within the property valuation is 102m 2013 14: 100m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income, against which the Group holds a provision of 5m 2013 14: 5m.
The balance arises through the IFRS treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.
Cumulative interest capitalised against investment, development and trading properties amounts to 81m 2013 14: 73m.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 139 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 11 Property continued Valuation The Groups total property portfolio was valued by independent external valuers on the basis of fair value, in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014, ninth edition, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The information provided to the valuers, and the assumptions and valuations models used by the valuers are reviewed by the property portfolio team, the Head of Offices, the Head of Retail and the Chief Financial Officer.
The valuers meet with the external auditors and also present directly to the Audit Committee at the interim and year end review of results.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on page 80.
Investment properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued by adopting the investment method of valuation.
This approach involves applying capitalisation yields to current and future rental streams net of income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods and associated running costs.
These capitalisation yields and future rental values are based on comparable property and leasing transactions in the market using the valuers professional judgement and market observation.
Other factors taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.
In the case of ongoing developments, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development, including a notional finance cost, together with a further allowance for remaining risk.
Properties held for development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.

2 Includes Residential with an average capital value per sq ft of 981, including developments at end value and mixed use.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield or discount rate would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset, and an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.

Net debt continued Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Risks relating to capital structure are addressed within managing risk on pages 56 to 61.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing debt are set out in the financial policies on pages 53 to 55.
Interest rate risk management The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2015 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 126m 2013 14: net liability of 45m.
The cross currency swap of the 2015 US Private Placement, which fully hedges the foreign exchange exposure of the issuance, has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
The market value of this is an asset of 6m 2013 4: liability of 5m.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2015 was nil 2013 14: nil.
The cash flows occur and enter into the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises variable rate debt and foreign currency denominated debt hedged at 31 March 2015.
Cash Flow hedged debt 2015 2014 m m Outstanding: at one year 1,138 1,293 at two years 538 1,225 at five years 450 350 at ten years 250 250 The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At March 2015 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39, is a net asset of 133m 2013 14: net asset of 25m.
The cross currency swaps of the 2018 2021 2023 2026 US Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating rate of 146 basis points above LIBOR.
These have been designated as fair value hedges of the US Private Placements.
Interest rate profile including effect of derivatives 2015 2014 m m Fixed rate 2,589 2,208 Variable rate net of cash 1,239 973 3,828 3,181 All the debt is effectively Sterling denominated except for 39m 2013 14: 68m of Euro debt of which 36m is at a fixed rate 2013 14: 68m.
At 31 March 2015 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 4.81% 2013 14: 5.17%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 7.1 years 2013 14: 8.5 years.
The weighted average interest rate for the Euro fixed rate debt is 5.13% 2013 14: 5.20% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 1.0 years 2013 14: 1.9 years.
The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Companys choosing at the relevant LIBOR or similar rate.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 68% at 31 March 2015 on a spot basis.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest as an average over the next five-year forecast period on a proportionally consolidated basis was 64% at 31st March 2015.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 53m 2013 14: 56m decrease.
Similarly, a 57 bps reduction would increase profits by 5m 2013 14: 5m increase.
The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month Sterling LIBOR over the last ten years.
The impact assumes LIBOR does not fall below 0%.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 153 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 18.
Net debt continued Upward movements in medium and long term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
The majority of the Groups interest rate swaps which provide such protection qualify as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 therefore movements in the fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven-year Sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
At 31 March 2015 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate swaps by 151m 2013 4: 136m.
A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of the interest rate swap portfolio by 155m 2013 14: 164m.
Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
The 1.5% Convertible Bond is designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Principal components of the market value include British Lands share price and its volatility, and market interest rates.
The fair value at 31 March 2015 was 493m.
At 31 March 2015 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value by 24.6m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the value by 26.2m.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as will the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
Based on the 31 March 2015 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a nil change 2013 14: nil in reported profits.
Assets Liabilities 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Euro denominated 39 69 39 68 Credit risk management The Groups approach to credit risk management of counterparties is referred to in the financial policies on pages 53 to 55 and the risks addressed within managing risk on pages 56 to 61.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Cash and short term deposits at 31 March 2015 amounted to 108m 2013 14: 142m.
Deposits and interest rate deposits were placed with financial institutions with Aor better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2015, the fair value of all interest rate derivative assets was 139m 2013 14: 32m.
At 31 March 2015, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and derivatives was 59m 2013 14: 71m.
This represents 0.5% 2013 14: 0.7% of gross assets.
The deposit exposures are with UK and international high street banks and branches.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 14.
Provisions are made taking account historic credit losses and the creditworthiness of debtors.
Liquidity risk management The Groups approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the financial policies on pages 53 to 55, and the risks addressed within managing risk on pages 56 to 61.
The table on page 155 presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
154 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2015 18.
Net debt continued Liquidity risk management continued The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of ten years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are also shown in the table below.
Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.
Any short term liquidity gap between the net payments required and the rentals receivable can be met through other liquidity sources available to the Group.
The Group currently holds cash and short-term deposits of 108m of which 84m is not subject to a security interest see footnote 6 to net debt table on page 149.
Further liquidity can be achieved through sales of property assets or investments and debt refinancings.
The Groups property portfolio is valued externally 9,509m and the share of joint ventures and funds property is valued at 4,714m see note 11.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group are a further source of liquidity.
The maturity profile of committed undrawn borrowing facilities is shown overleaf.

Acquisition of subsidiaries business combinations Acquisition of Tesco BL Holdings Limited and TBL Property Partnership On 19 March 2015, the Group acquired the 50% interest in Tesco BL Holdings Limited TBLH and TBL Property Partnership TBL which were previously owned by Tesco PLC.
This resulted in ownership of 100% of the entities.
Management determined that the acquisitions should be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The fair value of the Groups 50% equity interest in TBLH and TBL held before the business combination amounted to 149m and 29m respectively.
A gain of 5m was recognised as a result of re-measuring the equity interest in TBLH to fair value and a gain of 1m was recognised as a result of re-measuring the equity interest in TBL to fair value as part of the business combinations.
The acquired subsidiaries have contributed net revenues of 1m and underlying profit of 1m to the Group for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2015.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2014, Group net revenue for 2015 would have increased by 37m, and underlying profit for 2015 would have increased by 12m.
The purchase of TBLH and TBL was completed at the same time as the sale of the Groups interest in the Tesco Aqua Limited Partnership Aqua.
The consideration paid for TBLH and TBL was net of the sale consideration receivable for Aqua and the settlement of the Groups shareholder loan to Aqua.
A reconciliation of the consideration is shown below: Attributed fair value Total TBLH TBL m m m Investment Property 639 118 757 Other net current liabilities assets 11 5 6 Cash and cash equivalents 7 2 9 Loans 337 61 398 Fair value of acquired interest in net assets of subsidiary 298 64 362 Goodwill Total purchase consideration 298 64 362 Less: Fair value of previously held interest 149 29 178 Consideration 149 35 184 Less: cash acquired 7 2 9 Net consideration 142 33 175 Represented by: Cash 102 Cash acquired 9 Settlement of Aqua shareholder loan 35 Disposal of interest in Aqua 47 Net consideration 175 The acquired bank loans and overdrafts in TBLH and TBL have no recourse to other companies or assets in the Group.

Acquisition of Speke Unit Trust On 23 February 2015, the Group acquired an additional 37.5% of the units in the Speke Unit Trust, a unit trust registered in Jersey, which is engaged in property investment, resulting in cumulative ownership of 87.5% of the outstanding units and control of the underlying entity.
Management determined that the acquisition of control should be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations The fair value of the Groups 50% equity interest in the Speke Unit Trust held before the business combination amounted to 122m.
No gain or loss was recognised as a result of re-measuring the equity interest at fair value.
The acquired subsidiary has contributed net rents of 1m and underlying profit of 1m to the Group for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2015.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2014, Group net rents for 2015 would have increased by 15m, and underlying profit for 2015 would have increased by 7m.
The purchase consideration disclosed below comprises cash and cash equivalents paid to the acquirees previous owner of 93m for 37.5% of the units in the Speke Unit Trust.

Hedging and translation reserve The hedging and translation reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow and foreign currency hedging instruments, as well as all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
The foreign exchange differences also include the translation of the liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Revaluation reserve The revaluation reserve relates to owner-occupied properties and investments in joint ventures and funds.
Merger reserve This comprises the premium on the share placing in March 2013.
No share premium is recorded in the Companys financial statements, through the operation of the merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

Share capital and reserves continued At 31 March 2015, options over 7,703,110 ordinary shares were outstanding under employee share option plans.
The options had a weighted average life of 6.1 years.
Segment Information The Group allocates resources to investment and asset management according to the sectors it expects to perform over the medium term.
Its two principal sectors are currently Offices and Retail.
The Office sector includes residential, as this is often incorporated into Office schemes, and Retail includes leisure, for a similar rationale.
The relevant revenue, net rental income, operating result, assets and capital expenditure, being the measures of segment revenue, segment result and segment assets used by the management of the business, are set out below.
Management reviews the performance of the business principally on a proportionally consolidated basis which includes the Groups share of joint ventures and funds on a line-by-line basis and excludes non-controlling interests in the Groups subsidiaries.
Revenue is derived principally from the rental of buildings and the sale of trading properties.
Operating result is the net of net rental income, fee income and administration expenses.
No customer exceeded 10% of the Groups revenues in either year.
