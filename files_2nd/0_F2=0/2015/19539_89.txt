Operating assets and liabilities 6 Intangible assets This note provides details of the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenues and profits.
These assets include items such as goodwill, and other intangible assets such as brands, customer relationships, computer software, in-process R&D and technology which have predominantly been acquired as part of business combinations.
These assets are initially measured at fair value, meaning the best estimate of the value for which these assets could be sold in an arms length transaction.
Goodwill represents the excess between the amount paid to acquire the businesses over the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date.
This section also explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the directors in arriving at the carrying value of these assets.
6.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups total identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill previously written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1 October 1998 has not been reinstated and is not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
Gains and losses on disposal of the entity include the carrying amount of the foreign exchange on the goodwill relating to the entity sold except for goodwill taken to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 October 2004.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the allocation represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.

126 The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Goodwill impairment tests The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the reporting period by CGU: 2015 2014 m m France 186.3 196.7 UK & Ireland 180.6 180.6 Spain 107.0 112.9 Sage Pay Europe 23.6 24.2 Germany 32.1 31.4 Switzerland 34.5 32.8 Poland 5.8 6.2 Portugal 4.7 4.9 North America Sage Business Solutions Division SBS 635.4 533.6 Sage Payment Solutions Division SPS 165.0 154.1 Brazil 76.8 South Africa 36.3 39.7 Australia 19.0 20.4 Malaysia 11.2 14.0 Singapore 4.5 4.7 1,446.0 1,433.0 The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use.
In determining value-inuse, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
In all cases, the 2016 budget and the approved Group plan for the five years following the current financial year form the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
Beyond the five year plan these projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are the average medium term revenue growth rate, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
The average medium-term revenue growth rate for the first five years is based on the 2016 budget and the approved Group 5-year plan.
The average medium-term revenue growth rate applied to CGUs reflects the specific rates for each territory.
The long-term operating margin before central costs assumed for a CGUs operations is based on the 2016 budget and the approved Group 5-year plan.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs reflects the specific rates for each territory.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Range of rates used across the different CGUs 2015 2014 Average medium-term revenue growth rate 0% - 20% 1% - 15% Long-term operating margin before central costs 12% - 63% 26% - 62% Long-term growth rates to net operating cash flows 1.1% - 4.2% 1.3% - 5.1% Average Medium-Term Revenue Growth Rate is calculated on value in use projections that exclude intercompany revenue.
In accordance with IAS 36, key assumptions for those CGUs where significant goodwill is held are disclosed.
These are deemed by management to be CGUs holding more than 10% of total goodwill.
The discount rate, average medium-term revenue growth rate, long-term operating margin before central costs and long-term growth rate assumptions used for the value-in-use calculation are shown below: Average Long-Term Local Long-Term Medium-Term Operating Discount Growth Revenue Margin before 2015 Rate Rate Growth Rate central costs UKI 9.1% 2.5% 6.7% 47.3% France 8.5% 2.1% 4.9% 30.2% North America SBS 8.9% 2.3% 10.0% 31.6% North America SPS 8.9% 2.3% 10.0% 30.7% The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 127 Operating assets and liabilities continued 6 Intangible assets continued 6.1 Goodwill continued Local Average Long-Term Discount Medium-Term Operating Rate Long-Term Revenue Margin before 2014 post tax Growth Rate Growth Rate central costs UKI 8.0% 1.7% 4.2% 43.1% France 7.1% 1.5% 0.8% 39.3% North America SBS 8.0% 2.4% 4.4% 32.1% North America SPS 8.0% 2.4% 12.1% 35.2% Average Medium-Term Revenue Growth Rate is calculated on value in use projections that exclude intercompany revenue.
Discount rate The Group uses a discount rate based on a local Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for each CGU, applying local government yield bonds and tax rates to each CGU on a geographical basis.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a post-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the Q3 2015 and the risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rates applied to CGUs were in the range of 7.24% 2014: 6.03% to 17.48% 2014: 17.05%, reflecting the specific rates for each territory.
Impairment charge The Group performed its annual test for impairment in the third quarter of 2015.
The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value for all CGUs with the exception of Brazil.
An impairment of 62.3m was recognised, driven by economic uncertainty in Brazil which is expected to continue in the future.
The key assumptions used in the impairment calculation for Brazil were revenue growth of 9% per annum, long term operating margin of 24%, long term growth of 2.6%, and discount rate of 17.48%.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the other CGUs and in the absence of goodwill in Brazil, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
128 The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 6.2 Other intangibles Accounting policy Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially held at fair value less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The main intangible assets recognised are brands, technology, in-process R&D, computer software and customer relationships.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Brand names 3 to 20 years Technology In process R&D IPR&D 3 to 7 years Customer relationships 4 to 15 years Computer software 2 to 5 years Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses if applicable.
Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed seven years.
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Internally generated software development costs qualify for capitalisation if the Group can demonstrate all of the following: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it: Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset: how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits: The existence of a market or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset: The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset: Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
Generally, commercial viability of new products is not proven until all high risk development issues have been resolved through testing pre-launch versions of the product.
As a result, technical feasibility is proven only after completion of the detailed design phase and formal approval, which occurs just before the products are ready to go to market.
Accordingly, development costs have not been capitalised.
However, the group continues to assess the eligibility of development costs for capitalisation on a project by project basis.
Costs which are incurred after the general release of internally generated software or costs which are incurred in order to enhance existing products are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and included within research and development expense in the financial statements see note 3.2.
