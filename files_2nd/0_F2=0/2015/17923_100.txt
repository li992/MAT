13 Non-executive Directors remuneration in FY2016 In FY2016, the remuneration for the Non-executive Directors will be paid in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGMs.
9 for the remuneration policy for the Non-executive Directors Fees for the Non-executive Directors other than the Chairman are determined by the Chairman and the CEO.
Fees for the Chairman are determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
Fee levels for the Non-executive Directors and the Chairman, which are reviewed annually, have remained unchanged since 2011.
The annual review includes benchmarking, with the assistance of external advisers, against peer companies.
Based on the review conducted in June 2015: the Board, with support from the Chairman, has decided to reduce the Chairmans fee by approximately 13 per cent from US$1.100 million to US$0.960 million per annum, and the Chairman and the CEO have decided to reduce the Non-executive Director base fee by approximately six per cent from US$0.170 million to US$0.160 million per annum.
These reductions were considered appropriate in light of the challenging external environment and the benchmarking data for peer companies.
The different percentage reduction for the Chairman compared with that for Non-executive Directors reflects the relevant benchmarks for those roles.
A decision was also taken to include mandatory superannuation contributions within the relevant base fee from 1 July 2015, which is more closely aligned to the practices of other companies.
This has the effect of further reducing Non-executive Director remuneration for those Directors who receive Australian superannuation contributions.
For those Directors, this results in an average reduction of approximately 12 per cent in the aggregate of their base fees and superannuation contributions.
The table below sets out the fee levels for FY2016, and the changes in fee levels since FY2011.
