ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES UNAUDITED PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION As explained in the Financial Review on page 53 and consistent with the presentation in the Business Review, management reviews the performance of the business on a proportionally consolidated basis, including the Groups share of Property interests, but excluding the Groups interest in premium outlets held through investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets.
This is because the Group has less day-to-day involvement in the operational activities and the premium outlets sector has different operational characteristics compared with the Groups other property sectors.
The information in the following tables has been prepared on this basis and further details of the definitions for information contained within this section can be found in the Glossary on pages 181 and 182.

Staff costs amounting to 1.9 million 2014: 1.5 million have been capitalised as development costs and are excluded from table 106.
Our business model for developments is to use a combination of in-house staff and external advisers.
The cost of external advisers is capitalised to the cost of developments.
The cost of staff working on developments is generally expensed, but is capitalised subject to meeting certain criteria related to the degree of time spent on and the stage of progress of specific projects.
