FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, IFRC interpretations and with the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP, issued January 2009.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements are summarised below.
All of the Companys activities are inter-related and each activity is dependent on the others.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment and therefore segmental information is not required.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Change of accounting policy for disclosure of CFD costs There has been a change of accounting policy to improve the disclosure of the commercial substance of the following costs.
Interest paid on CFDs of 564,000 and dividends paid on short CFDs of 178,000 are categorised as Finance costs in the Income Statement rather than as a deduction from Derivative income, as was the case last year.
These costs were incurred on CFDs which are a component of gearing and the substance of these costs is that of an interest expense.
The effect of this change of accounting policy on the corresponding figures for the year ended 31March 2014 is to increase finance costs by 770,000 and to increase derivative income by the same amount.
There is no effect on the net profit after taxation, the net assets of the Company or the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in either year.
There is no effect on the Balance Sheet at 31 March 2013 and the Company is not required to present a third Balance Sheet at that date.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments revised IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers It is anticipated that the adoption of these Standards in future periods will have no material financial effect on the financial statements of the Company.
c Presentation of the Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net profit after taxation is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. d Income Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where appropriate certain derivatives, such as contracts for difference CFDs, are used.
Income derived from these is included in Derivative income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
e Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.

g Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest and fees on bank loans and interest paid on CFDs, which are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method, and dividends paid on short CFDs, which are accounted for on the date on which the obligation to incur the cost is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Finance costs are allocated equally between revenue and capital.
h Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of taxation currently payable and deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation, as reported in the Income Statement, because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Companies which are approved as Investment Trusts under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
i Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
j Valuation of investments The portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss, which is initially taken to be their cost, and is subsequently measured as bid or last prices, depending upon the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
Investments which are not quoted, or are not frequently traded, are stated at the Directors best estimate of fair value, based on recognised valuation techniques which may take account of the most recent arms length transactions in the investment.
Valuation reports are provided to the Board by the Fair Value Committee of the Managers, which is independent of the Portfolio Management Team.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments within Gains on investments designated at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed them in note 10 below.

Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include CFDs, futures, options, warrants and forward currency contracts.
They are held at fair value through profit or loss and are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: CFDs the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract, calculated in accordance with accounting policy 2 j above: and Futures and options the quoted trade price for the contract.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income derived from them is included in Derivative income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included in Gains onderivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within Current assets and Current liabilities.
Premiums received on written options are taken to capital and are included in Gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
During the year the Company has obtained equivalent exposure to Chinese and Hong Kong equities through the use of CFDs.
The gearing level is monitored and reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis.
All gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in Gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Dividends received on the long CFDs are included in Derivative income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Interest paid on CFDs and dividends paid on short CFDs are included in Finance costs and are allocated equally between revenue and capital.
l Bank loans Loans are initially included in the Financial Statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
m Capital reserve The following are transferred to capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments, including derivatives: Changes in the fair value of investments, including derivatives, held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fee: 50% of the investment management fee: 50% of finance costs: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Taxation charged or credited relating to items which are capital in nature.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable Profits, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of level 3 investments with a fair value of 160,000 2014: 33,245,000. n Dividends Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment isestablished.

It is not distributable by way of dividend and it cannot be used to fund share repurchases.
The other reserve is a distributable premium reserve created on 21 April 2010 when High Court approval was given for the share premium account at that date to be cancelled.
As a result 452,232,000 was transferred from the share premium account to the other reserve.
It can be used to fund share repurchases and it is distributable by way of dividend.

The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by the Company.
The Board with the assistance of the Managers, has developed a risk matrix which, as part of the internal control process, identifies the operational risks that the Company faces.
Risks identified are strategic, marketing and business development, investment management, company secretarial, fund administration and operations and support function risks.
Risks are identified and graded in this process, together with steps taken in mitigation of risks, and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Principal risks identified are shown in the Strategic Report on pages 10 and 11.
This Note is incorporated in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares and equity linked notes: Derivative instruments which comprise forward currency contracts, CFDs and warrants, and futures and options written or purchased on stocks and equity indices: Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations: and Bank borrowings.
The risks identified by IFRS 7 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has long and short CFDs and a multicurrency revolving credit facility for US$150,000,000 expiring on 14 February 2017.
The Company has drawn down the whole of this facility as disclosed in Note 13 above.
Interest rate risk exposure The value of the Companys financial instruments that are exposed to movements in interest rates are shown below: 2015 2014 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Long CFDs exposure less fair value 96,633 37,631 Short CFDs exposure plus fair value 22,078 10,549 Bank loans 101,014 89,963 219,725 138,143 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Cash and cash equivalents 14,932 16,662 Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers 1,383 16,315 16,662 Net exposure to financial instruments that bear interest 203,410 121,481 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2015 53 53 Job No: 21960 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Event:3 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA Job No: 21960 Proof Event: 15 Black Line Event:3 Park Communications Ltd Alpine Way London E6 6LA Customer: Fidelity Project Title: FCSS Annual Report 2015 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600 Customer: Fidelity Project Title: FCSS Annual Report 2015 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600 FINANCIAL Notes to the Financial Statements 18 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency risk The Companys net profit after taxation and its net assets can be affected by foreign exchange rate movements because the Company has income, assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency which is UK sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in currency exchange rates affecting the value of investments and bank loans: movements in currency exchange rates affecting short-term timing differences: and movements in currency exchange rates affecting income received.
The Company will also be subject to short-term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example, between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Currency exposure of financial assets The Companys financial assets comprise equity investments, long positions on derivative instruments, short-term debtors and cash and cash equivalents.
The currency profile of these financial assets is shown below: 2015 investments designated exposure to at fair value long cash and through profit derivative other cash or loss instruments receivables equivalents total 000 000 000 000 000 Australian dollar 4,962 4,962 Canadian dollar 2,534 140 2,674 Chinese renminbi 164,024 6,605 170,629 Hong Kong dollar 538,576 115,950 4,403 5,090 664,019 Singapore dollar 5,926 2,301 8,227 Taiwan dollar 14,147 14,147 UK sterling 36,968 368 3,212 40,548 US dollar 233,906 46,927 25 280,858 1,001,043 165,318 4,771 14,932 1,186,064 Other receivables include amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers.

Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through price movements in its investment positions.
The Portfolio Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with underlying exposures, are assessed by the Portfolio Managers specialist derivative instruments team.
The Board meets quarterly to review the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
Liquidity The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities if required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are shown in Note 13 above.
Counterparty risk Certain of the derivative instruments in which the Company may invest are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Managers employ, the Managers will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties which it believes to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk, by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings, and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For Over The Counter OTC derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 March 2015, 39,032,000 2014: 4,300,000 was held by the broker, in government bonds in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the Company, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the Company and 1,383,000 2014: nil, was held by the Company in cash, shown as Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers in the Balance Sheet, in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the broker, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the broker.

All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Managers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker and are kept under review by the Managers.
Exposure to credit risk arises on outstanding securities transactions, derivative instruments and cash at bank.
Derivative instruments risk A Derivative Instrument Charter, including an appendix entitled Derivative Risk Measurement and Management, details the risks and risk management processes used by the Managers.
This Charter was approved by the Board and allows the use of derivative instruments for the following purposes: to gain exposure to equity markets, sectors or individual investments: to hedge equity market risk in the Companys investments with the intention of mitigating losses in the event of market falls: to enhance portfolio returns by writing call and put options: and to take short positions in equity markets, which would benefit from a fall in the relevant market price, where the Manager believes the investment is overvalued.
These positions therefore distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and investment performance of these instruments are managed by an experienced, specialist derivative team of the Managers using portfolio risk assessment tools for portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and interest rates at the balance sheet date, an increase of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have decreased both the net profit after taxation for the year and the net assets of the Company by 509,000 2014: 304,000.
A decrease of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have had an equal but opposite effect.

Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives are disclosed in the Strategic Report, on pages 10 and 11.
An increase of 10% in the share prices of the investments designated at fair value through profit or loss at 31 March 2015 would have increased both the profit after taxation for the year and the net assets of the Company by 100,104,000 2014:73,532,000.
A decrease of 10% in the share prices of the investments designated at fair value through profit or loss would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in derivative instruments to gain exposure to the equity market.
An increase of 10% in the share prices of the investments underlying the derivative instruments at 31 March 2015 would have increased both the profit after taxation for the year and the net assets of the Company by 14,256,000 2014: 4,510,000.
A decrease of 10% in the share prices of the investments underlying the derivative instruments would have had an equal but opposite effect.

As explained in Notes 2 j and k above, investments are shown at fair value which is bid or last market price.
In the case of cash and cash equivalents, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exception is the US dollar denominated bank loan, its fair value having been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current US dollar interest rates.
