Notes to the company accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and under the historical cost convention, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The results of Amec Foster Wheeler plc are included in the consolidated accounts of Amec Foster Wheeler plc which are available from Booths Park, Chelford Road, Knutsford, Cheshire, WA16 8QZ.
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest million.
As the acquisition of Foster Wheeler AG in November 2014 resulted in the Group securing more than 90% of Foster Wheelers issued share capital, the acquisition qualifies for merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 from crediting the share premium account.
As a result the balance sheet at 31 December 2014 has been restated to present the excess of the nominal value of the shares issued of 877m, as a merger reserve.
The company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously issued UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for all periods presented.
Transition tables showing all material adjustments are disclosed in note 12.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Amec Foster Wheeler believe some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from: Impairment of investments in subsidiaries.
Determining whether the companys investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments values in use.
The value in use calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and suitable discount rates in order to calculate present values.
The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries at the balance sheet date was 4,219m 2014: 4,480m with an impairment loss of 351m recognised in 2015 2014: nil.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument and is as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in a currency other than Sterling are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured in terms of historical cost and are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets held at 31 December 2015 are as follows: Software Three to seven years Interest Interest is recognised in profit or loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less impairment losses.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is treated as a capital contribution by the company and the investments in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
Pensions The company participates in the Amec Staff and Executive defined benefit pension schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the company.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost to individual Group entities, the company has recognised a cost equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit schemes can be found in note 14 of the consolidated accounts.
Contributions to the defined contribution schemes are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become payable.
Tangible assets Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives as at 31 December 2015 are as follows: Plant and equipment Three to five years Amec Foster Wheeler 160 Annual report and accounts 2015 1 Accounting policies continued Remuneration of auditors The detailed information concerning auditors remuneration is shown in note 4 of the consolidated accounts.
Share-based payments There are share-based payment arrangements which allow Amec Foster Wheeler employees to acquire Amec Foster Wheeler shares: these awards are granted by Amec Foster Wheeler.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as a cost is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by IAS 12 Income Taxes.
