Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Deferred tax continued No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As these earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $140.6m 2014: $93.7m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Tax losses are recognised where there is reasonable certainty that they can be utilised in future years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The deferred tax balances are analysed below:- Short term Accelerated tax Share based timing depreciation Pension charges differences Losses Total 2015 $m $m $m $m $m $m Deferred tax assets 49.7 - 14.3 71.8 26.1 62.5 Deferred tax liabilities - 0.9 - 5.1 - 6.0 Net deferred tax asset 49.7 0.9 14.3 66.7 26.1 56.5 2014 Deferred tax assets 44.5 5.4 10.7 90.3 0.4 62.3 Deferred tax liabilities - - - 3.9 - 3.9 Net deferred tax asset 44.5 5.4 10.7 86.4 0.4 58.4 20 Share based charges The Group currently has a number of share schemes that give rise to share based charges.
These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP and the Long Term Plan LTP.
The LTP replaced the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP in 2013.
The charge to operating profit in 2015 for these schemes amounted to $12.3m 2014: $17.4m.
$12.7m 2014: $18.2m relating to the charge has been credited to retained earnings and $0.4m 2014: $0.8m has been deducted from liabilities reflecting a credit to operating profit for the year in respect of true-ups to the LTCIP, which is a cash settled scheme.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below.
ESOS and LTRP For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 20% for ESOS and 25% for LTRP.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk free rate of return is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was in place from 2008 to 2012.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives were awarded shares or share options dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the LTIP were EBITA, OCER ratio of operating capital employed to revenue, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The LTIP awards are in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
20% of any award earned over the three year performance cycle is deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
Long Term Plan The Groups Long Term Plan LTP was introduced during 2013 to replace the LTRP, LTIP and LTCIP.
Two distinct awards will be made under LTP.
Nil value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under the LTRP see above.
Awards to former LTIP and LTCIP participants will be made on a broadly similar basis to LTIP with the performance measures being EBITA, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Participants may be granted conditional share awards or nil cost options at the start of the cycle.
Performance is measured over a three year period and up to 80% of an award may vest based on the performance over that period.
The vesting of at least 20% of any award is normally deferred for a further period of at least two years.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Share based charges continued Performance based awards Details of the LTIP LTP awards are set out in the table below.
The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
Further details of the LTIP LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

Further details on the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
LTCIP The share based charge for the LTCIP for cycle 4 and 5 was calculated using a fair value of 5.95.
The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above.
Share options A summary of the basis for the charge for ESOS, LTRP and LTP options is set out below together with the number of options granted, exercised and lapsed during the year.
Share options are granted at an exercise price equal to the average mid-market price of the shares on the three days prior to the date of grant.
The basis of the scheme is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually based on performance criteria that consider the growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share in the prior year.
There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of options under the LTRP.
Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Nil value share options The following options granted under the Groups LTP were outstanding at 31 December: Number of ordinary shares under option Exercise price Year of Grant 2015 2014 per share Exercise period 2013 11,500 11,500 0.00p 2017-2018 2014 844,595 950,896 0.00p 2018-2019 2015 330,769 - 0.00p 2017-2018 2015 235,000 - 0.00p 2019-2020 1,421,864 962,396 Options are granted under the Groups LTP at nil value.
There are performance criteria relating to the creation of the pool available but none relating to the exercise of the options.
