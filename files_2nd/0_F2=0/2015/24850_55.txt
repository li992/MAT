STATED CAPITAL Authorised Share Capital An unlimited number of Unclassified shares of no par value each.
In the event of a return of capital on a winding-up or otherwise, the holders of Shares are entitled to participate in the distribution of capital after paying all the debts and satisfying all the liabilities attributable to the relevant Share class.
The holders of Shares of the relevant Share class shall be entitled to receive by way of capital any surplus assets of the Share class in proportion to their holdings.
In the event that the Share class has insufficient funds or assets to meet all the debt and liabilities attributable to that Share class, any such shortfall shall be paid out of funds or assets attributable to the other Share classes in proportion to the respective net assets of the relevant Share classes as at the date of winding-up.
Pursuant to Section 276 of the Law, a share in the Company confers on the shareholder the right to vote on resolutions of the Company, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the Board of Directors, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of the surplus assets of the Company.
DISCOUNT MANAGEMENT PROVISION On 24 February 2016, the Company's Articles were amended by special resolution to remove the previous discount management provision, and to insert the following provision: The Directors shall at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2021 propose an Ordinary Resolution that the Company continues its business as a closed-ended collective investment scheme a Continuation Resolution.
If a Continuation Resolution is passed at such Annual General Meeting then the Directors shall be required to propose a further Continuation Resolution at every fifth Annual General Meeting thereafter.
Page 67 v. 2.7 If a Continuation Resolution is not passed, then the Directors shall, within six months of such Continuation Resolution not being passed, put proposals to Shareholders for the reconstruction, reorganisation or winding up of the Company.
Until 24 February 2016 the Companys Articles incorporated a discount management provision which applied to each class of Ordinary Shares individually, requiring a continuation vote to be proposed in respect of the particular class of Ordinary Shares at a class meeting of the relevant shareholders by way of ordinary resolution if, over the previous 12 month rolling period commencing from 1 January 2008, the relevant class of Ordinary Shares has traded, on average calculated by averaging the closing mid-market share price on the dates which are 5 Business Days after the date on which each estimated Published NAV announcement is made for each NAV Calculation date over the period at a discount in excess of 5 per cent to the average NAV per Ordinary Share of that class calculated by averaging the NAV per Ordinary Share of that class as at the NAV Calculation Date at the end of each month during the period.
In the event that a vote to continue was proposed and passed for any class of Ordinary Shares as a result of the operation of such mechanism, no further continuation vote was capable of being proposed for that class for a further 12 months from the date of the passing of the continuation resolution.
If such continuation vote was not passed, the Directors were to be required to formulate redemption proposals to be put to the Shareholders of that class offering to redeem their Ordinary Shares at the relevant published NAV on the NAV Calculation Date immediately preceding such redemption less the costs of all such redemptions.
However, where one or more such resolutions in respect of the same period is are not passed and the class es of Ordinary Shares involved represent 75 per cent.
or more of the Companys net assets attributable to all Ordinary Shares at the last NAV Calculation Date on or immediately preceding the date of the latest continuation resolution being defeated, the Directors may first at their discretion put forward alternative proposals to all Shareholders to offer to repurchase their shares or to reorganise, reconstruct or wind up the Company.
If, however, such alternative proposals are not passed by the necessary majority of shareholders of the relevant class, the Directors must proceed to offer to redeem the relevant class es of Ordinary Shares on the terms described above.
Where following redemption of any class of Ordinary Shares under the discount management provision in place prior to 24 February 2016, the number of Ordinary Shares of that class remaining in issue represent less than 25 per cent.
of the Ordinary Shares of that class in issue immediately before such redemption or the listing for such class of Ordinary Shares on the Official List is withdrawn or threatened to be withdrawn or the Directors determine that the conditions for the continued listing of that class are not or they believe will not be met, then the Company may redeem the remaining issued Ordinary Shares of that class within three months of such determination at a redemption price equal to the NAV of the Ordinary Shares of that class on the NAV Calculation Date selected by the Directors for such purpose less the costs of such redemption.
