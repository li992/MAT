1.1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC Cairn or the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 14 March 2016.
Cairn is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH3 9BY.
Cairn prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis, unless accounting standards require an alternate measurement basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed either in the relevant accounting policy or in the notes to the financial statements.
The financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS.
The Groups financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
B ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Cairn prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the EU, and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

C BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
Where subsidiaries follow differing accounting policies from those of the Group, those accounting policies have been adjusted to align with those of the Group.
Inter-company balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, though foreign exchange differences arising on inter-company balances between subsidiaries with differing functional currencies are not offset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in any year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition while the results of subsidiaries disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows to the date at which control passes from the Group.
116 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic report Leadership and governance Financial statements Additional information 1.1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED D JOINT ARRANGEMENTS Cairn is a partner joint operator in oil and gas exploration and development licences which are unincorporated joint arrangements.
All of the Groups current interests in these arrangements are determined to be joint operations.
A full list of oil and gas licence interests can be found on pages 156 and 157.
Costs incurred relating to an interest in a joint operation are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies for oil and gas assets as appropriate Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
All of the Groups Intangible exploration appraisal assets and Property, plant & equipment development producing assets are related to interests in joint operations.
Cairns working capital balances relating to joint operations are included in Other receivables Section 3.3 and Trade and other payables Section 3.4.
Any share of finance income or costs generated or incurred by the joint operation is included within the appropriate Income Statement account.
E FOREIGN CURRENCIES These financial statements continue to be presented in US dollars US$, the functional currency of the parent.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date or an approximation thereof where not materially different.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the financial statements of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates subsidiary financial statements into the presentation currency, US$, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non-US$ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to US$1 were as follows: Closing YTD Average Closing YTD Average 2015 2015 2014 2014 Sterling 0.679 0.654 0.642 0.640 Norwegian Kroner 8.842 8.048 7.474 6.282 Euro 0.921 0.901 0.827 0.753 1.2 GOING CONCERN The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement of going concern.
In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Board and Audit Committee considered the Group cash flow forecasts under various scenarios, identifying risks and mitigants and ensuring the Group has sufficient funding to meet its current commitments as and when they fall due.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for a period of 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements and have therefore used the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Board and Audit Committees assessment of risk and mitigants to the Groups operational existence beyond this 12 month period is included in the viability statement on page 43.
