As of 1 July, AllBlue allocated to a new share class in BlueCrest Capital International, which carried a 1% 25% fee structure compared to 2% 20% in the previous class.
During the year, the allocations to BlueCrest Capital International and BlueCrest Equity Strategies were increased by approx.
In the case of BlueCrest Capital International this increase followed a reduction in the allocation over Q1, and reflected increasing volatility within developed fixed income markets as investors anticipated the first hike in US interest rates.
The increased allocation to BlueCrest Equity Strategies reflected the committees continued conviction that dispersion within equity markets would continue to present opportunities for portfolio managers.
The allocations that were reduced over the year were BlueCrest Multi Strategy Credit, BlueCrest Quantitative Equity, BlueTrend and BlueCrest Mercantile which saw reductions of approximately -5%, -3%, -3% and -1% respectively.
It should be noted that the reduction in allocation to BlueTrend coincided with a switch to access the twice leveraged vehicle as detailed above, so whilst the capital allocation was reduced risk exposure to the strategy marginally increased.
The allocation to Emerging Markets finished the year in line with where it was at the end of the previous year.
