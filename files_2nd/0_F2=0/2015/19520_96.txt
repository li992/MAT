Financial risk factors Financial risk management Overview In the normal course of business, the group is exposed to the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note explains the groups exposure to each of the above risks, aided by quantitative disclosures included throughout these consolidated financial statements, and it summarises the policies and processes that are in place to measure and manage the risks arising, including those related to the management of capital.
The directors are ultimately responsible for the establishment and oversight of the groups risk management framework.
An essential part of this framework is the role undertaken by the audit committee of the board, supported by the internal audit function, and by the Chief Financial Officer, who in this regard is supported by the treasury committee and the group treasury function.
Among other responsibilities, the audit committee reviews the internal control environment and risk management systems within the group and it reports its activities to the board.
The board also receives a quarterly report on treasury activities, including confirmation of compliance with treasury risk management policies.
The group treasury function is responsible for the management of cash, borrowings and the financial risks arising in relation to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and the price risk of some commodities.
The responsibility for the management of the remaining commodities exposures primarily lies with the groups centralised procurement function, SABMiller Procurement GmbH SABMiller Procurement.
Some of the risk management strategies include the use of derivatives in order to manage the currency, interest rate and commodities exposures arising from the groups operations.
It is the policy of the group that no trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The groups treasury policies are established to identify and analyse the financial risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor exposures and adherence to limits.
Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group is subject to exposure on the translation of the foreign currency denominated net assets of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into the groups US dollar reporting currency.
The group seeks to mitigate this exposure, where cost effective, by borrowing in the same currencies as the functional currencies of its main operating units or by achieving the same effect through the use of derivatives.
An approximate nominal value equivalent to US$3,691 million 2014: US$4,774 million of borrowings have been swapped into currencies that match the currency of the underlying operations of the group, including Australian dollar, Colombian peso, Czech koruna, Peruvian nuevo sol, Polish zloty and South African rand.
The group does not hedge currency exposures from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The group is also exposed to transactional currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of group entities.
These exposures are managed primarily by the group treasury function which, subject to regulatory constraints orcurrency market limitations, hedges a proportion of the foreign currency exposures estimated to arise over a period of up to 18months.
Committed transactional exposures that are certain are hedged fully without limitation in time.
The group principally uses forward exchange derivatives to hedge currency risk.
The tables below set out the groups currency exposures from financial assets and liabilities held by group companies in currencies other than their functional currencies and resulting in exchange movements in the income statement and balance sheet.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on a basis consistent with the prior year, based on reasonably possible changes in exchange rates, and assumes all other variables are held constant.

SABMiller plc Annual Report 2015 145 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial risk factors continued The group holds foreign currency cash flow hedges totalling US$1,892 million at 31 March 2015 2014: US$1,559 million.
The foreign exchange gainsor losses on these contracts are recorded in the cash flow hedging reserve until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains and losses are transferred to inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill or to the income statement as appropriate.
The group holds net investment hedges totalling US$3,111 million at 31 March 2015 2014: US$5,617 million.
The foreign exchange gains or losses on these instruments are recorded in the net investment hedging reserve and partially offset the foreign currency translation risk on the groups foreign currency net assets.
ii Interest rate risk The policy for managing interest rate risk was refined in the year and is now monitored based on net debt exposures, rather than gross debt as in prior years.
As at 31 March 2015 57% 2014: 50%, restated of net debt was in fixed rates taking into account interest rate derivatives.
The groups practice is to borrow direct or synthetically in floating rates, reflecting the fact that floating rates are generally lower than fixed rates over the medium term.
The extent to which group borrowings may be in floating rates is restricted by policy such that the impact of a 1% increase in interest rates on finance costs can be no more than an agreed proportion of adjusted EBITDA.
The policy excludes borrowings arising from acquisitions in the previous six months.
Exposure to movements in interest rates in group borrowings is managed through interest rate derivatives.
The cash flow interest rate risk sensitivities on variable debt and interest rate swaps are shown in the table below.
This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis was performed on the same basis in the prior year, based on reasonably possible changes in interest rates.
2015 2014 US$m US$m Net debt 10,465 14,303 Less: fixed rate debt 9,550 11,824 Variable rate debt 915 2,479 Adjust for: Financial derivatives 3,545 4,712 Net variable rate debt exposure 4,460 7,191 - 100 bps change Potential impact on profit for the year 45 72 - 100 bps change Potential impact on other comprehensive income Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed income instruments Changes in the market interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income if these are measured at their fair value.
As such, all financial instruments with fixed rates of interest that are accounted for at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7.
The group holds derivative contracts with a nominal value of US$4,204 million as at 31 March 2015 2014: US$6,414 million which are designated as fair value hedges.
In the case of these instruments and the underlying fixed rate bonds, changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the hedging instrument attributable to interest rate movements materially net off in the income statement in the same period.
iii Price risk Commodity price risk The group is exposed to variability in the price of commodities used in the production or in the packaging of finished products, such as the price of malt, barley, sugar, diesel and aluminium.
Commodity price risk is managed within minimum and maximum guard rails principally through multi-year fixed price contracts with suppliers and, where appropriate, derivative contracts.
At 31 March 2015 the notional value of commodity derivatives amounted to US$142 million 2014: US$143 million.
No sensitivity analysis has been provided on these outstanding contracts as the impact is considered to be immaterial.
Equity securities price risk The group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the group and classified on the balance sheet as available forsale investments.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Financial instruments The group limits its exposure to financial institutions by setting credit limits on a sliding scale based on their credit ratings and generally dealing only with counterparties with a minimum credit rating of BBBfrom Standard & Poors and Fitch, and Baa3 from Moodys.
For banks with a lower credit rating, or with no international credit rating, a maximum limit of US$5 million is applied, unless specific approval is obtained from either the Chief Financial Officer or the audit committee of the board.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
To reduce credit exposures, the group hasISDA Master Agreements with most of its counterparties for financial derivatives, which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certaincircumstances.
146 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements 21.
Financial risk factors continued Trade and other receivables There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed.
The type of customers range from wholesalers and distributors to smaller retailers.
The group has implemented policies thatrequire appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount ofexposure to any one counterparty.
The group considers its maximum credit risk to be US$3,760 million 2014: US$4,480 million which is the total of the groups financial assets.
c. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and a mixture of short-term and medium-term bank credit facilities, bankloans, corporate bonds and commercial paper with a range of maturity dates.
In this way, the group ensures that it is not overly reliant on anyparticular liquidity source or that maturities of borrowings sourced in this way are not overly concentrated.
Subsidiaries have access to local bank credit facilities, but are principally funded by the group.
Liquidity risk faced by the group is mitigated by having diverse sources of finance available to it and by maintaining substantial unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity, as indicated by the level of undrawn facilities.
Undrawn borrowing facilities The group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 March in respect of which all conditions precedent had been metat that date.
2015 2014 US$m US$m Amounts expiring: Within one year 65 214 Between one and two years 76 41 Between two and five years 3,503 3,019 3,644 3,274 At 31 March 2015 the group had the following core lines of credit that were available for general corporate purposes.
SABMiller plc: US$2,500 million committed syndicated revolving credit facility, which is due to expire in May 2019.
SABMiller Holdings Inc: US$1,000 million committed syndicated revolving credit facility, which is due to expire in May 2019.
In April 2015 the group extended its existing US$2,500 million and US$1,000 million committed syndicated facilities, both shown as undrawn in the table above, by one year to May 2020.
The table below analyses the groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual settlement date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
The amounts disclosed for financial guarantee contracts represent the maximum possible cash outflows for guarantees provided in respect of associates and third party bank facilities, which would only be payable upon the occurrence of certain default events.
Should such events occur, certain remedies are available that could mitigate the impact.

Financial risk factors continued Capital management The capital structure of the group consists of net debt see note 27c and shareholders equity.
The groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Besides the minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the groups only externally imposed capital requirement relates to the groups core lines of credit which include a net debt to EBITDA financial covenant which was complied with throughout the year.
The group monitors its financial capacity and credit ratings by reference to a number of key financial ratios and cash flow metrics including net debt to adjusted EBITDA and interest cover.
These provide a framework within which the groups capital base is managed including dividend policy.
If the group fails to meet the financial targets required by the ratings agencies, a credit rating downgrade could impact the average interest rate of borrowings and the future availability of credit to the group.
The group is currently rated Baa1 positive outlook by Moodys Investors Service and Astable outlook by Standard & Poors Ratings Services.
Fair value estimation The following tables present the groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and the fair values of other assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value, but where the fair value is required to be disclosed in the financial statements.

The levels of the fair value hierarchy and its application to the groups assets and liabilities are described below.
Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The fair value of assets and liabilities traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded asactive if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, andthose prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over the counter derivatives or infrequently traded listed investments are determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
The fair values of derivatives included in level 2 incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, spot and forward foreign exchange rates, and interest rate curves.
The fair values of borrowings included in level 2 are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments, using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Valuation techniques for other level 2 instruments could include standard valuation models based on market parameters for interest rates, yield curves or foreign exchange rates quotes for similar instruments from financial counterparties or the use of comparable arms length transactions, anddiscounted cash flows.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Specific valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value of the remaining financial instruments.
Valuation process The groups treasury function is responsible for performing fair value measurements for financial instruments.
The fair value measurement calculations are subject to review procedures and are performed in accordance with policies defined by the treasury committee.
Other fair value measurements are performed by the groups finance department.
Significant level 3 valuations are reviewed and approved by the finance, control and assurance committee in the relevant region on a by exception basis.
Valuations falling into this category are usually immaterial.
