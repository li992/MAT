Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 2 Segmental analyses As the chief operating decision maker, the Management Board reviews external revenues and adjusted profit from operations to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources to the overall business.
The results of Next Generation Products as a separate segment are currently not material to the Group and therefore it is not considered a reportable segment that requires separate disclosure under the requirements of IFRS8 Operating Segments.
Interest income, interest expense and taxation are centrally managed and accordingly such items are not presented by segment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.
The four geographic regions are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Groups internal reporting systems and are the basis used by the Management Board for assessing performance and allocating resources.
The Management Board reviews current and prior year segmental revenue, adjusted profit from operations of subsidiaries and joint operations, and adjusted post-tax results of associates and joint ventures at constant rates of exchange.
The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group, including inter-company royalties payable in foreign currency to UK entities.
However, the Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by movements in exchange rates.
As a result, the 2015 segmental results were translated using the 2014 rates of exchange.
The 2014 figures are stated at the 2014 rates of exchange and are, therefore, unadjusted from those published for 2014.
The analyses of revenue for the 12 months to 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, based on location of sales, are as follows: 2015 2014 Revenue Translation Revenue Constant rates exchange Current rates Revenue m m m m Asia-Pacific 3,874 101 3,773 3,873 Americas 3,340 620 2,720 2,990 Western Europe 3,476 273 3,203 3,359 EEMEA 4,030 622 3,408 3,749 Revenue 14,720 1,616 13,104 13,971 The analyses of profit from operations and the Groups share of the post-tax results of associates and joint ventures, reconciled to profit before taxation, are as follows: 2015 2014 Adjusted Adjusted segment Segment Adjusted segment result Translation result Adjusting result segment Adjusting Segment Constant rates exchange Current rates items Current rates result items result m m m m m m m m Asia-Pacific 1,546 77 1,469 108 1,361 1,548 188 1,360 Americas 1,426 257 1,169 87 1,082 1,286 89 1,197 Western Europe 1,249 103 1,146 156 990 1,189 171 1,018 EEMEA 1,399 191 1,208 81 1,127 1,380 62 1,318 5,620 628 4,992 432 4,560 5,403 510 4,893 Fox River 27 27 Flintkote 3 3 374 374 Profit from operations 5,620 628 4,992 435 4,557 5,403 857 4,546 Net finance income costs 464 37 427 489 62 417 417 Asia-Pacific 278 8 286 16 302 277 14 291 Americas 610 46 656 277 933 431 7 424 EEMEA 1 1 1 4 4 Share of post-tax results of associatesand joint ventures 889 54 943 293 1,236 712 7 719 Profit before taxation 6,045 537 5,508 347 5,855 5,698 850 4,848 The adjustments to profit from operations, net finance income costs and the Groups share of the post-tax results of associates and joint ventures are explained in notes 3 e to 3 h, note 4 b and note 5, respectively.
The Fox River credit in 2014 see note 3 g and note 30 and the Flintkote charge in 2014 and 2015 see note 3 h and note 30 have not been allocated to any segment as they neither relate to current operations nor the tobacco business.
They are presented separately from the segmental reporting which is used to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources, and is reported to the chief operating decision maker on this basis.
