7 Financial Statementscontinued 25 Employee share ownership plans Awards were provided under the following employee share ownership plans for the year ended 30 June 2015: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Short Term Incentive Plan STIP, Management Award Plan MAP, Group Short Term Incentive Plan GSTIP, Transitional GMC awards and the all-employee share plan, Shareplus.
In prior years, awards were also made under the Group Incentive Scheme GIS and the Kgatelo Pele Employee Share Ownership Plan.
These awards take the form of rights to receive ordinary shares in either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc.
Awards made are subject to performance conditions LTIP and Transitional GMC and service conditions all plans.
Subject to the performance conditions and service conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the awards will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options over the relevant number of ordinary shares.
Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue: however, there is discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation of BHP Billitons share capital.
As a result of the demerger of South32, adjustments were made to unvested awards to ensure that participants continue to be appropriately treated.
At the time of the demerger, unvested awards under the LTIP, STIP, MAP, GSTIP, those provided as Transitional GMC awards and GIS were adjusted to reflect the reduction in the value of BHP Billiton after South32 demerged.
During the year ended 30 June 2015, no new awards were granted under either of the GIS deferred shares or Transitional GMC awards, except for the adjustments as described above.
In relation to unvested awards under Shareplus, compensatory awards were granted to reflect the reduction in the value of BHP Billiton after South32 demerged.
The new number of unvested awards for each participant when taken together with the compensatory awards referred to above equals the number of awards held before the demerger multiplied by BHP Billiton five-day volume weighted average price VWAP plus South32 five-day VWAP divided by BHP Billiton five-day VWAP.
Prices were based on the first five trading days following South32s listing on the relevant exchanges on 18 May 2015.
All LTIP, STIP and GIS awards and all MAP and GSTIP awards granted prior to 1 July 2011 are eligible to receive a payment equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares awarded to those participants the Dividend Equivalent Payment or DEP.
The DEP is provided to the participants once the underlying shares are allocated or transferred to them.
No DEP is provided in respect of any awards that lapse.
All Transitional GMC awards and awards granted after 1 July 2011 under GSTIP and MAP are not eligible for a DEP.
A description of these plans is as follows: i STIP, GIS and GSTIP The STIP which replaced GIS in FY2014 is a plan for the GMC and the GSTIP is a plan for senior management employees other than the GMC being first introduced during the year ended 30 June 2009.
The plans allow a portion of short-term incentive amounts being a percentage of base salary to be deferred.
Half of the short-term incentive is paid in cash.
The remaining half is provided in the form of STIP, GIS or GSTIP awards being a grant of rights to receive BHP Billiton shares.
The rights are subject to a two-year vesting period before they vest or can be exercised.
If, during the vesting period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their rights are forfeited.
Awards in respect of the year ended 30 June 2015 will be granted during the year ending 30 June 2016. ii LTIP and MAP The LTIP is a plan for the GMC, and awards are granted annually.
The performance condition applicable to the awards requires the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR over a five-year performance period to be greater than the Peer Group TSR being the weighted median TSR where the comparator group is a specified group of peer companies.
For awards granted from December 2010 onwards, performance relative to this Peer Group TSR performance condition determines the vesting of 67 per cent of the LTIP awards, while performance relative to the Index TSR being the index value where the comparator group is a market index such as the MSCI World performance condition determines the vesting of 33 per cent of the LTIP awards.
To the extent that the performance condition is not achieved, awards are forfeited.
For the awards to vest in full, the Groups TSR must exceed the Peer Group TSR and Index TSR if applicable by a specified percentage per year, determined for each grant by the Remuneration Committee.
Since the establishment of the LTIP in 2004, this percentage has been set at 5.5 per cent per year.
The vesting scale is determined for each grant by the Committee.
For awards granted prior to December 2013, vested awards were able to be exercised for up to five years following the date that vesting is determined, with an expiry date prior to the fifth anniversary of vesting.
From December 2013 onwards, vested awards will be transferred to individuals as soon as practicable after the relevant vesting date.
The MAP is a plan for management employees other than the GMC.
Under the MAP, participants receive an award of rights to receive BHP Billiton shares.
The number of rights is determined by role, performance and organisational level.
There are no performance conditions attached to the awards and awards will vest at the end of three years providing participants remain in employment over that time.
iii Transitional GMC awards The Remuneration Committee may determine that these awards are provided to new GMC members recruited from within BHP Billiton as a transitional measure to bridge the time-based gap between the vesting of MAP awards that were granted to these individuals in their non-GMC management positions with a three-year service condition and the LTIP awards provided to GMC members with a five-year service and performance condition.
Transitional GMC awards have two tranches.
Tranche one has a three-year service and performance condition.
Tranche two has a four-year service and performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee has absolute discretion to determine if the performance condition has been met and whether any, all or part of the award will vest or otherwise lapse, having regard to but not limited to BHP Billitons TSR over the threeor four-year performance period respectively, the participants contribution to Group outcomes and the participants personal performance with guidance on this assessment from the CEO.
iv Shareplus Shareplus is an all-employee share purchase plan which commenced in April 2007.
Employees may contribute up to US$5,000 to acquire shares Acquired Shares in any Plan year.
On the third anniversary of the start of a Plan year, the Company will match the number of Acquired Shares held by the employee at that time with Matched Shares.
The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the Matched Shares until they are awarded.
Acquired Shares are purchased on a quarterly basis.
Employees can sell their Acquired Shares at any time.
If, prior to the third anniversary, an individual sells their Acquired Shares, resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement to Matched Shares is forfeited.
v Kgatelo Pele ESOP The Kgatelo Pele ESOP commenced in June 2013 with a three-year vesting period.
All eligible employees are entitled to awards to the value of ZAR8,667 each year.
Beneficiaries must be permanently employed by Hotazel Manganese Mines Pty Ltd as at 1 May effective date of each year to qualify for the allocation for that particular year.
Hotazel Manganese Mines Pty Ltd will contribute the necessary amount to the Kgatelo Pele Trust by way of donation to enable the purchase of shares, which will be held until the end of the vesting period.
During this period, beneficiaries will be entitled to dividends declared by BHP Billiton.
At the end of each vesting period, eligible employees will be given the opportunity to create a portfolio by having the shares transferred into their own names or to sell their entitlements and receive the cash benefit.
In May 2015, BHP Billitons interest in Hotazel Manganese Mines Pty Ltd was divested as part of South32, and the Kgatelo Pele Trust is no longer part of the Group.
The Group will not make future contributions to the Kgatelo Pele Trust.
