Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 145 Sensitivity Analysis The table below sets out the sensitivity of the profit on insurance business and net assets to changes in key assumptions.
The levels of sensitivity tested are consistent with those proposed in the EEV principles and reflect reasonably possible levels of change in the assumptions.
The analysis reflects the change in the variable assumption shown while all other variables assumptions are left unchanged.
In practice variables assumptions may change at the same time, as some may be correlated for example, an increase in interest rates may also result in an increase in expenses if the increase reflects higher inflation.
It should also be noted that in some instances sensitivities are non-linear.
The sensitivity % has been applied to proportion the assumption e. g. application of a 10% sensitivity to a withdrawal assumption of 8% will reduce it to 7.2%.
