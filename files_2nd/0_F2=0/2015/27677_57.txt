J: Other notes J1: Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world.
These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.

The weighted average share price at date of exercise for options exercised during the year was R247.
b Measurements and assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Share options are granted under a service and non-market based performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the share options granted.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The grant date for the UK and South African plan awards is deemed to be 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue.
As such the Group is required to estimate, at the reporting date, the number and fair value of the options that will be granted in the following year.
The fair value of awards expected to be granted in 2016 which will have an IFRS 2 grant date of 1 January 2015, is shown separately below.
The grant date for all other awards is the award issue date.
c Share-based payment arrangements relating to Institutional Asset Management During the year ended 31 December 2015, OM Asset Management had the following share-based payment arrangements: Initial public offering IPO Incentive Plan During 2011, a share-based compensation plan was implemented for certain key employees of OM Asset Management in connection with the stated intention of exploring a potential IPO of the business.
The plan was designed to reward participants for achievement of strategic objectives and metrics and value creation over the period of exploring an IPO.
The awards consisted of a mix of cash, payable and paid in the first quarter of 2014, and restricted shares in Old Mutual plc, which were granted during the second quarter of 2014, and vest ratably over three years from that date.
At grant date, the stock awards under this plan had an aggregate value of $3.9 million.
The total expense recognised during 2015 in relation to this plan was $0.6 million 2014: $1 million: 2013: $3.7 million.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials 266 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 J: Other notes continued J2: Share-based payments continued OM Asset Management Equity Incentive Plan continued c Share-based payment arrangements relating to Institutional Asset Management continued In connection with the IPO, certain employees who held unvested Old Mutual plc restricted shares were given the opportunity to exchange their Old Mutual plc restricted shares for restricted shares of OM Asset Management held by OM Group UK Limited with vesting conditions similar to those to which they were currently subject to.
These restricted shares were awarded to employees as part of the annual incentive process and the one-time IPO Incentive Plan.
This exchange programme was intended to provide employees who elected to participate with restricted share awards of OM Asset Management ordinary shares of equivalent value to the Old Mutual plc restricted shares they currently held.
The exchange valued OM Asset Management ordinary shares at the price sold to investors in the IPO.
The exchange valued Old Mutual plcs ordinary shares using the weighted-average sale price over the three consecutive trading days on the London Stock Exchange up to and including the date of the exchange.
The exchange occurred following the effectiveness of the OM Asset Management registration statement on 8 October 2014.
OM Group UK Limited transferred 1,212,766 unvested and vested restricted OM Asset Management ordinary shares equivalent to 5,914,981 Old Mutual plc restricted shares to employees as part of this exchange programme.
In connection with the reorganisation, two equity plans were implemented at OMAM: one for employees and one for non-executive directors.
The plans are maintained to provide equity-based compensation arrangements, including restricted stock awards RSAs, restricted stock units RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units Performance RSUs.
Equity ownership encourages employees and directors to act in the best long-term interests of the Company.
OM Asset Management Affiliate Equity Plans Equity granted during the year to employees of firms participating in the OM Asset Management Affiliate Equity Plans vests three to four years from the date of grant, conditional upon continued employment over this period.
Equity purchased by employees vested immediately.
Grant date fair value and fair value used for reassessment was determined based on a multiple of prior year earnings.
Under the terms of the arrangements, participating employees may sell their equity back to OM Asset Management which acts as a buyer of last resort at a fixed multiple of prior year earnings, subject to certain restrictions.
Accordingly, the schemes are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments, despite the fact the initial purchase and or grants of equity are settled in equity instruments.
The following summarises the fair value of instruments purchased from and granted by OM Asset Management during the year: Total nonAffiliate Affiliate Affiliate controlling share share shares interest Instruments granted and purchased during the year purchases grants forfeited in affiliate Percentage of affiliate equity 2015 0.02% 1.41% 0.59% 0.84% 2014 0.10% 2.69% 10.75% 7.96% Fair value of instruments $m 2015 $13m 2014 $17m 1 Represents fair value in excess of consideration received for affiliate share purchases.
OM Asset Management annual bonus awards The OM Asset Management Affiliate Equity Plans are incorporated into annual bonus awards of employees at participating firms, which are to be settled partly in cash and partly in equity.
The level of bonus is contingent upon current year financial and individual performance, therefore the vesting period for bonus equity to be granted during 2016 in respect of the 2015 financial year has been determined to commence from 1 January 2015.
It is anticipated that instruments with a fair value of $9.5 million 2014: $10.2 million and 2013: $15 million will be granted during 2016 to firms participating in the OM Asset Management Affiliate Equity Plans based on 2015 financial performance.
Acadian Asset Management AAM Class B equity interests in AAM acquired by employees during 2007 entitled the participating employees to 28.57% of the earnings of AAM in excess of $120 million, and to a liquidation preference proportionate to their shareholding.
In consideration for the equity acquired, the participating employees agreed to forgo a portion of existing long-term incentive payments owed.
The difference between the carrying amount of this consideration and the fair value of the interest acquired was treated as share-based compensation expense in 2007.
Fair value was determined based on the discounted projected future cash flows of AAM.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials Effective 1 April 201 1, certain terms of the plan were modified to provide for greater participation by Class B interest holders in Acadians 267 profits and cash distributions.
In addition, provisions were added to provide greater liquidity and transferability for the holders of Class B interests.
The plan has since included a feature whereby participating employees may sell their equity back to OM Asset Management based on a multiple of prior 12-month earnings above a Class A equity holders minimum preference amount, subject to certain restrictions.
The surrender-date fair value of the Class B interests prior to these modifications amounted to $7 million, and this amount was reclassified from non-controlling interests to cash-settled share-based payments liabilities as a result of the liquidity features added.
The excess of the fair value of the modified award over its pre-modification fair value was $21 million, and was accounted for as incremental cash-settled sharebased payments compensation expense and liability.
As the implementation of the modifications were subject to a two-year vesting period, the incremental cash-settled share-based payments compensation expense and subsequent revaluations of the liability each period to its fair value, along with the reclassification of the $7 million pre-modification fair value of the award from non-controlling interests as a liability, were recognised ratably over that period commencing 1 April 201 1.
The remaining $35 million of the initial fair value of the equity-settled plan that was surrendered by Class B interest holders was transferred to controlling interest equity at the conclusion of the vesting period.
During 2014, employees sold Class B equity interests of 14.29% back to OM Asset Management.
Class B equity interests of 14.29% remain outstanding at 31 December 2015. d Forfeitable Restricted share grants The following summarises the fair value of restricted shares granted by the Group during the year: Weighted Number average Instruments granted and purchased during the year granted fair value Shares in Old Mutual plc London Stock Exchange 2015 11,544,922 2.08 2014 11,047,898 2.02 Shares in Old Mutual plc Johannesburg Stock Exchange 2015 14,244,304 R42.24 2014 13,350,717 R35.35 Shares in Nedbank Limited 2015 3,879,259 R231.76 2014 4,225,723 R201.11 The share price at measurement date was used to determine the fair value of the restricted shares.
Expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value where the holder of the restricted share is entitled to dividends throughout the vesting period.
e Annual bonus awards The UK and South Africa Plan Awards give rise to annual bonus awards.
The level of annual bonus awards is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of individual and company performance targets, measured over the financial year prior to the date the employees receive the award.
The accounting grant date for the South African and UK annual bonus plans other than the new joiner and newly qualified grants has therefore been determined as 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue of the grants.
The Group anticipates awards under the South African scheme of 8,243,127 restricted shares 2014: 10,022,998.
The restricted shares have been valued using a share price of R41.45 2014: R34.70.
The Group estimate of the total fair value of the annual bonus expected to be paid in the form of options and forfeitable shares is outlined below.
The fair value is determined by making an estimate of the level of bonus to be paid out following the attainment of personal and company performance conditions.

The Group has evaluated the extent of the possibility of the guarantees being called on and has provided appropriately.
The Group, through its South African banking business, has pledged debt securities and negotiable certificates of deposit amounting to 681 million 2014: 767 million as collateral for deposits received under re-purchase agreements.
These amounts represent assets that have been transferred but do not qualify for derecognition under IAS 39.
These transactions are entered into under terms and conditions that are standard industry practice to securities borrowing and lending activities.
Contingent liabilities tax The Revenue authorities in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States routinely review historic transactions undertaken and tax law interpretations made by the Group.
The Group is committed to conducting its tax affairs in accordance with the tax legislation of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
All interpretations made by management are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances of the transaction and the relevant legislation.
There are occasions where the Groups interpretation of tax law may be challenged by the Revenue authorities.
The financial statements include provisions that reflect the Groups assessment of liabilities which might reasonably be expected to materialise as part of its review.
The Board is satisfied that adequate provisions have been made to cater for the resolution of tax uncertainties and that the resources required to fund such potential settlements are sufficient.
Due to the level of estimation required in determining tax provisions, amounts eventually payable may differ from the provision recognised.

The largest of these potential actions is a claim for R773 million in the High Court against Nedbank Limited Nedbank by Absa Bank Limited Absa in connection with Pinnacle Point Group Ltd, where Absa is alleging that Nedbank had a legal duty of care to them in relation to single stock futures transactions.
Nedbank has filed an exception against the claim and the claim has been held in abeyance since April 2012 by mutual agreement.
Consumer protection Old Mutual is committed to treating customers fairly and supporting its customers in meeting their lifetime goals and treating customers fairly is central to how our businesses operate.
We routinely engage with customers and regulators to ensure that we meet this commitment, but there is the risk of regulatory intervention across various jurisdictions, giving rise to the potential for customer redress which can result in retrospective changes to policyholder benefits, penalties or fines.
The Group monitors the exposure to these actions and makes provision for the related costs as appropriate.
On 2 March 2016, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA notified Old Mutual Wealth that one of its subsidiaries, Old Mutual Wealth Life Assurance Limited, would be investigated by the Enforcement Division of the FCA.
The appointment has arisen following an industry-wide thematic project on Fair treatment of long-standing customers of life insurers by the FCA in 2014, which focused on our UK closed book of insurance products.
The appointment of investigators does not itself mean that the FCA has determined that rule breaches and or other contraventions or offences have occurred, and at this early stage it is not possible to assess the outcome and, by extension, whether the matter will have financial consequences for Old Mutual Wealth.

The accounting must be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
The carrying value of assets and liabilities in Quilter Cheviots consolidated statement of financial position on acquisition date approximates the fair value of these items determined by the Group, with the exception of identified intangible assets of 288 million, additional provisions of 3 million and an additional deferred tax liability of 58 million.
The intangible assets recognised relate to customer distribution channels 273 million and to the Quilter Cheviot brand 15 million.
The value of the intangible assets was determined by applying cash flows to standard industry valuations models.
Goodwill is attributable to the delivery of significant cost and revenue synergies that cannot be linked to identifiable intangible assets.
This goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Of the acquired receivables, 121 million represent short-dated receivables that arise from the normal course of business and represent the gross cash flows that are expected to be received over a period of three months.
No contingent liability has been recognised on acquisition.
3 In addition to the 566 million cash consideration paid, 19.3 million Old Mutual plc ordinary shares of 11 7p with a value on issue of 42 million were placed into an employee benefit trust.
50% of these shares will be released to the participants after three years and the other 50% after four years, on the fulfilment of conditions relating to the maintenance of the level of funds under management.
These expenses will be recognised in the profit or loss over the vesting periods of three and four years and will be excluded from the determination of AOP.
Transaction costs incurred of 9 million relating to the acquisition have been recognised within other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement, but not included within adjusted operating profit.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, Quilter Cheviot contributed 12 million in profit after tax attributable to equity holders and 34 million in adjusted operating profit after tax.

Results of the Strategic Review Following the appointment of Bruce Hemphill as Group Chief Executive in November 2015 a strategic review of the Group was initiated.
On 11 March 2016 the Group announced that, following the strategic review, it had been concluded that the long-term interests of the Groups shareholders and other stakeholders will be best served by Old Mutual separating its four principal businesses Emerging Markets, Nedbank, Old Mutual Wealth and OM Asset Management plc from each other.
Following completion of the managed separation and at an appropriate point in the future, the Group, in its current structure will no longer exist.
The precise means by which this managed separation of the Group will be effected is yet to be determined, and will involve significant ongoing regulatory and stakeholder engagement.
The Group has a range of options open to it and the feasibility, sequencing and timing of each element will be affected by a mixture of market, regulatory and other factors.
We intend to update shareholders later in 2016 to provide greater clarity on our preferred route for the managed separation.
We expect that the managed separation will be materially completed by the end of 2018.
