Share Fraud and boiler room scams Shareholders in a number of Investment Trusts have been approached as part of a share fraud where they are informed of an opportunity to sell their shares as the company is subject to a takeover bid.
This is not true and is an attempt to defraud shareholders.
The share fraud also seeks payment of a commission by shareholders to the parties carrying out the fraud.
Shareholders should remain alert to this type of scam and treat with suspicion any contact by telephone offering an attractive investment opportunity, such as a premium price for your shares, or an attempt to convince you that payment is required in order to release a settlement for your shares.
These frauds may also offer to sell your shares in companies which have little or no value or may offer you bonus shares.
These so called boiler room scams can also involve an attempt to obtain your personal and or banking information with which to commit identity fraud.
The caller may be friendly and reassuring or they may take a more urgent tone, encouraging you to act quickly otherwise you could lose money or miss out on a deal.
