This charge has been recognised in cost of sales.
b I ncreasing competition from Chinese e-commerce businesses as well as the financial impact of a longer-than-expected integration of operations is expected to affect short-to-medium-term profitability of the associate, resulting in an impairment charge in the year recognised in administrative expenses.
c I nvestments in and loans to the Harris Hoole and Euphorium businesses have been impaired as a result of the strategic decision to slow the roll-out of these brands recognised in administrative expenses.
d T his includes a 402m charge relating to increased inventories provisioning due to changes to range and stockholding, including general merchandise transformation, and the adoption of a forward looking provisioning methodology.
An additional 107m charge relates to changes in the estimate of in-store payroll overheads which are directly attributable to inventories, arising due to the change in focus of our in-store activities.
The Group has also changed its accounting policy to exclude certain in-store overheads from directly attributable costs in order to reflect more reliable and relevant information.
If the policy change were applied retrospectively, it would have reduced the 2013 14 inventories balance by 59m, of which 10m would have impacted the prior year income statement.
As these amounts are not material, the prior year comparatives have not been restated and the cumulative policy adjustment of 61m has been reflected in the current year.
e D uring the year, the Group received a notification from the Valuation Office that it had moved to a separate assessment of rates for ATM sites in Tesco stores.
This resulted in a backdated charge of 41m.
The charge in respect of the current year is included in underlying profit within cost of sales.
f This includes the loss on disposal of Blinkbox Movies and Music, and redundancy cost, asset impairments and other costs associated with the closure of non-core businesses including Blinkbox Books and Tesco Broadband.
Of this loss, 74m has been recognised in cost of sales and 7m was recognised in administrative expenses.
g R estructuring costs include redundancy and compensation costs related to changes in store colleague working arrangements in the UK, Europe and Asia, redundancy costs relating to Head Office restructures across the Group, and the redundancy cost of store closures in the UK.
266m has been recognised in costs of sales and 150m within administrative expenses.
Commercial income h O n 22 September 2014 the Group announced that the previous guidance given on 29 August 2014 regarding profit for the six months to 23 August 2014 was overstated principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs.
The internal investigation into the appropriate recognition included a review of whether the impact of accelerated recognition should be attributed to prior years.
A t the time of the interim results, the impacts on prior years were estimated as resulting in the profit before tax for the year ended 22 February 2014 being overstated by 70m and for the years prior to that being overstated by a total of 75m.
F ollowing further investigations, these estimates have been revised to a total overstatement to profit before tax of 53m for the year ended 22 February 2014, and a total overstatement of 155m for the years prior to that.
O n the basis that these figures are not material in the prior years, a prior year restatement has not been made with the amounts instead being corrected in the current year.
The impact of this has been separately identified in the reconciliation of profit before tax to underlying profit above as the correction does not reflect current year performance.
