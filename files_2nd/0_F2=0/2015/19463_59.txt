104 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 6 Pension schemes Accounting policy The expense of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement employee benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method and charged in the income statement as an operating expense, based on actuarial assumptions reflecting market conditions at the beginning of the financial year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs and credits are recognised immediately at the earlier of when plan amendments or curtailments occur and when related restructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised.
Settlements are recognised when they occur.
Net pension obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes are included in the statement of financial position at the present value of scheme liabilities, less the fair value of scheme assets.
Where schemes are in surplus, i. e. assets exceed liabilities, the net pension assets are separately included in the statement of financial position.
Any net pension asset is limited to the extent that the asset is recoverable through reductions in future contributions.
The expense of defined contribution pension schemes and other employee benefits is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty At 31 December 2015, the Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US.
These schemes require management to exercise judgement in estimating the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, especially given the length of each schemes liabilities.
Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes involves judgement about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation, the future operation of each scheme and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates for these factors are used in determining the pension cost and liabilities reported in the financial statements.
The estimates made around future developments of each of the critical assumptions are made in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Each scheme is subject to a periodic review by independent actuaries.
Information regarding some of the assumptions used for valuation is provided below, together with a sensitivity analysis.
A number of pension schemes are operated around the world.
Historically, the largest schemes have been local versions of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2015 are in the UK and the US.
The Netherlands scheme was transferred to a collective industry-wide scheme in November 2015, as described below.
Major defined benefit schemes in place at 31 December 2015 The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service up to certain limits which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at specified minimum rates.
Each of the major defined benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees ofthe pension funds in the UK and plan fiduciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneficiaries.
In the UK, the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The board of trustees consists of an equal number of company-appointed and member nominated Directors.
In the US, the fiduciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of the Groups major schemes reflects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
The 2015 valuation process has not been finalised.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pensions Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectified with additional contributions over a seven-year period.
Total regular employer contributions to defined benefit pension schemes, in respect of 2016 are expected to be approximately 62m.
Apension deficit funding contribution of 20m is also expected to be made in 2016, relating to the UK scheme recovery plan.
Changes to the Netherlands scheme In November 2015, the Netherlands defined benefit pension scheme together with all associated assets and liabilities, was transferred into an industry-wide collective defined contribution scheme.
This scheme is now accounted for as a defined contribution pension plan, with no deficit or surplus recognised on the balance sheet.
The transfer of the scheme resulted in settlement and past service credits of 60m being recognised within operating profit.
The Group paid cash of 22m to align the funding level to that of the industry-wide collective pension scheme, in addition to other payments made in relation to the scheme settlement.
Prior to this, the scheme was a career average salary scheme and was open to new hires.

Service cost, including settlements and past service credits is presented within operating profit.
Settlements and past service credits in 2015 primarily relate to the transfer of the Netherlands scheme to a collective industry-wide scheme.
Settlements and past service credits in 2014 relate to plan design changes and a reduction in accrued benefits in respect of the scheme in the Netherlands.
Settlements and past service credits in 2013 principally relate to plan design changes and the transfer out of certain deferred members in the US scheme and a reduction in accrued benefits in respect of the scheme in the Netherlands.
The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent actuaries arepresented below.
The net defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31December of the prior year.
Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics.

The difference in assets and liabilities transferred results in a settlement credit of 29m 2014: nil.
In addition to the settlement credit, past service credits of 31m were recognised on transfer of the Netherlands pension scheme, resulting in a settlement and past service credit of 60m in total.
As at 31 December 2015, the defined benefit obligations comprised 3,849m 2014: 4,784m in relation to funded schemes and 195m 2014:193m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 20 years in the UK 2014: 19 years and 14 years in the US 2014:15years.
Deferred tax assets of 103m 2014: 161m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme deficits.

Assets and obligations associated with the schemes are sensitive to changes in the market values of assets and the market-related assumptions used to value scheme liabilities.
In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or inflation could increase future pension costs and funding requirements.
Typically the Groups schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual rates of return on plan assets may be below those rates used to determine the defined benefit obligations and interest rate risks, whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond yields in the UK and the US decline and are not offset by returns in government and corporate bond portfolios.
The schemes are also exposed to other risks, such as unanticipated future increases in: member longevity patterns, inflation, and future salaries, all potentially leading to an increase in scheme liabilities.
Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of defined benefit pensions in the short-term and long-term.
Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across geographies and among equities, government and corporate bonds, property funds and cash.
Asset allocations are dependent on avariety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the statutory funded status of the plan.
All equities and government and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets.
Sensitivity analysis The valuation of the Groups pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of the members, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: 180 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: 97 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: 115 The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the defined benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in the above assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
