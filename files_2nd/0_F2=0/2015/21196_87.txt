IFRS Financial statements 44 Effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year Certain estimates and assumptions used in determining our liabilities for insurance and investment contract business were changed from 2014 to 2015, affecting the profit recognised for the year with an equivalent effect on liabilities.
This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This note only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as unallocated divisible surplus, reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.

The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
There has been a release of expense reserves for the UK Life business following actions to reduce the current and long-term cost base.
There has been a release of the annuitant mortality reserves following the annual review of experience in UK Life.
Tax and other assumptions includes an impact of 48 million driven by a reduction in the best estimate allowance for the cost of the Mortgage Protection Guarantee in the UK.
The adverse change in discount rate assumptions on general insurance and health business of 100 million arises as a result of a decrease in the swap rates used to discount latent claim reserves, and a decrease in the swap rates, net of expected future inflation, used to value periodic payment orders.
In 2014 discount rate assumption changes were 145 million adverse due to a decrease in the swap rates used to discount latent claims reserves and periodic payment orders.
45 Unallocated divisible surplus An unallocated divisible surplus UDS is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain at the reporting date.
Therefore the expected duration for settlement of the UDS is not defined.
This note shows the movements in the UDS during the year.
2015 2014 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 9,467 6,709 Change in participating contract assets 935 3,087 Change in participating contract liabilities 36 299 Other movements 13 22 Change in liability recognised as an expense 984 3,364 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisition and disposals 724 131 Foreign exchange rate movements 396 444 Other movements 31 8,811 9,467 The amount of UDS has decreased to 8.8 billion at 31 December 2015 2014: 9.5 billion, despite the acquisition of Friends Life in April 2015 which increased the UDS balance by 724 million.
The reduction is driven primarily by adverse investment market movements in Continental Europe, mainly caused by the increase in interest rates and corporate bond yields during the year.
In addition, the UDS has reduced by 396 million due predominantly to the weakening of the euro.
Negative UDS balances result from an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
Any negative balances are tested for recoverability using embedded value methodology and in line with local accounting practice.
Testing is conducted at a participating fund-level within each life entity.
In both Italy and Spain, all participating funds had positive UDS balances at 31 December 2015, and consequently testing of negative UDS was not required.
In Italy, the carrying value of UDS was 840 million positive 2014: 953 million positive : in Spain, the carrying value of UDS was 207 million positive 2014: 248 million positive.
