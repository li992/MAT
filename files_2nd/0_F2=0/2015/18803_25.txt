FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies BASIS OF PREPARATION Accounting policies applicable to more than one section of the financial statements are shown below.
Where accounting policies relate to a specific note in the financial statements, they are set out within that note, to provide readers of the financial statements with a more useful layout to the financial information presented.
Statement of compliance Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in associates.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 133 to 137.
IFRSs announced but not yet effective The following IFRSs have been announced but are not yet effective in the preparation of these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements, unless otherwise indicated: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation effective 1 January 2016.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle effective 1 January 2016.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers effective 1 January 2018, not yet endorsed by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019, not yet endorsed by the IASB management has not yet completed its analysis of this standard.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments not yet endorsed by the IASB management has not yet completed its analysis of this standard.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as discussed in the relevant accounting policies.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies set out in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all years presented.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2015 but do not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Going concern The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions.
The Board has also reviewed the Groups funding requirements and the available debt facilities.
As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position and believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
In addition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described innote 14, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of investor returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the non-controlling interests share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position atthe date of acquisition, is reflected directly in shareholders equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way asunrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 95 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued FOREIGN CURRENCY Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities for example cash, trade receivables, trade payables denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are generally recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
For the policy on hedging of foreign currency transactions see note 14.
Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal.
For the policy on net investment hedging see note 14.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Assets and liabilities Income and expenses Actual rates Cumulative average rates Value of 1 31 Dec 2015 31 Dec 2014 2015 2014 US dollar 1.48 1.55 1.53 1.65 Euro 1.36 1.28 1.38 1.24 Chinese renminbi 9.61 9.65 9.62 10.15 Hong Kong dollar 11.48 12.04 11.87 12.80 Australian dollar 2.03 1.91 2.04 1.83 USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
JUDGEMENTS In applying the Groups accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Income tax The tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations.
Where the effect of these laws and regulations isunclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid: see note 6.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income: see note 6.
Basis of consolidation Judgement is applied when determining if the Group controls a subsidiary or associate.
In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has power over the investee to affect the amount of investor returns: see page 95 Basis of consolidation policy.
Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management determines whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill, and the amounts at which to recognise those assets: see note 9.
Restructuring In making a provision for restructuring, management has based its estimate of future costs on the specific circumstances of each local and regional restructuring plan, including estimated costs and timing of completion.
ESTIMATES Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have arisk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Claims In making provision for claims, management bases its estimate on the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents: see note 13.
96 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired.
This requires an estimation of the future cash flows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated: see note 9.
Contingent consideration When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable on agreed post completion dates.
These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.
At the date of acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due: see note 13.
Employee post-retirement benefit obligations For material defined benefit plans, the actuarial valuation includes assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates: see note 16.
Recoverability of trade receivables Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses.
This provision considers the past payment history and the length of time that the debt has remained unpaid: see note 11.
Accounting policies relating to a specific note in the financial statements are set out within that note as follows: Note Revenue 2 Separately Disclosed Items 3 Taxation 6 Property, plant and equipment 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets 9 Trade and other receivables 11 Trade and other payables 12 Provisions 13 Borrowings and financial instruments 14 Capital and reserves 15 Employee benefits 16 Share schemes 17 Non-controlling interest 20 2 Operating segments and presentation of results ACCOUNTING POLICY Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, excluding sales related taxes and intra-group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings is issued.
On long-term projects the Group records transactions as sales on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount being included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed.
Long-term projects consist of two main types: a time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly: or b staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue accrued accordingly.
Expenses are recharged to clients where permitted by the contract.
Payments received in advance from customers are recognised in deferred income where services have not yet been rendered.
OPERATING SEGMENTS The Group is organised into business lines, which are the Groups operating segments and are reported to the CEO, the chief operating decision maker.
These operating segments are aggregated into the five divisions, which are the Groups reportable segments based on similar nature of the products and services, and type of customer.
The five divisions, each of which offer services to different industries and are managed separately, are: Consumer Goods: Commercial & Electrical: Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals: Commodities and Industry & Assurance.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs which are not controlled by the five divisions are allocated appropriately.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
There is no significant seasonality in the Groups operations.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Theperformance of the segments is assessed based on adjusted operating profit which is stated before Separately Disclosed Items.
A reconciliation to operating profit by division and Group profit for the year is included overleaf.

Income tax is recognised in the same primary statement as the accounting transaction to which it relates.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the outcome of discussions with tax authorities is different from the amount initially recorded, this difference will impact the tax provisions in the period the determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures, the reversal of which isunder the control of the Group and where it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, for the periods when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 101 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 6 Taxation continued Deferred tax continued A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
TAX EXPENSE The Group operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are earned and taxed in the individual countries in which they occur.
The income tax expense for the loss before tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 is 39.3m 2014: 61.8m.
The Groups consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 is 12.8 % 2014: 24.5%.
The income tax expense for the adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 is 77.5m 2014: 72.0m.
The Groups adjusted consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015 is 24.3% 2014: 24.0%.
Differences between the consolidated effective tax rate of 12.8 % and notional statutory UK rate of 20.25% include, but are not limited to: the mix of profits, the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, the effect of utilised tax losses and under over provisions in previous periods.
The Group receives tax incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a lower tax charge to the income statement.
Without these incentives the adjusted effective tax rate would be 26.7% 2014: 27.1%.
There is no guarantee that these reduced rates will continue to be applicable in future years see note 22.
Following the acquisition of the US businesses, PSI and the MT Group see note 10, our expectation is that our effective tax rate for the forthcoming year is likely to increase.
Tax charge The total income tax charge, comprising the current tax charge and the movement in deferred tax, recognised in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2015 2014 m m Current tax charge for the period 72.6 65.1 Adjustments relating to prior year liabilities 2.6 Current tax 70.0 65.1 Deferred tax movement related to current year 35.1 6.3 Deferred tax movement related to prior year 4.4 3.0 Deferred tax movement 30.7 3.3 Total tax in income statement 39.3 61.8 Tax on adjusted result 77.5 72.0 Tax on Separately Disclosed Items 38.2 10.2 Total tax in income statement 39.3 61.8 Reconciliation of effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the Group on profit before taxation.

The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted in October 2015.

There is a temporary difference of 206.1m 2014: 214.6m which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings.
Nodeferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from, or sell, the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
104 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
Basic loss per share in 2015 is therefore equal to diluted loss per share.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and other Separately Disclosed Items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2015 2014 m m Loss profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 360.5 176.3 Separately Disclosed Items after tax note 3 588.7 37.8 Adjusted earnings 228.2 214.1 Number of shares millions Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 160.8 161.0 Potentially dilutive share awards 1.4 1.1 Diluted weighted average number of shares 162.2 162.1 Basic loss earnings per share 224.2 p 109.5p Potentially dilutive share awards 0.7 p Diluted loss earnings per share 224.2 p 108.8p Adjusted basic earnings per share 141.9p 133.0p Potentially dilutive share awards 1.2 p 0.9 p Adjusted diluted earnings per share 140.7p 132.1p 8 Property, plant and equipment ACCOUNTING POLICY Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups statement of financial position.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the expected lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings Term of lease Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment 3 to 10 years Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of assets are reassessed at each reporting date.
Impairment Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated to determine the level of any impairment.

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 From 1 January 2010, the Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in Separately Disclosed Items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised inprofit or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are taken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 107 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Other intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill.
If, based on managements judgement, such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software Up to 7 years Customer relationships Up to 10 years Know-how Up to 5 years Trade names Up to 5 years Licences Contractual life Covenants not to compete Contractual life Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position may be less than its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset or group of assets, i. e. cash generating unit, to which the goodwill relates.
A CGU represents an asset grouping at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash flows.
Animpairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

Additions during the year are converted at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the goodwill at the end ofthe year is stated at closing exchange rates.
Impairment review In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each operating segment or CGU.
The calculation is based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount.
Key assumptions The key assumptions include the rate of revenue and profit growth within each of the territories and business lines in which the Group operates.
These are based on the Groups approved budget and five year Strategic Plan.
The long-term growth rate is also key since it is used in the perpetuity calculations.
Finally, the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to a present value varies depending on the location of the operation and the nature of the operations.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to long-term growth rates and discount rates.
Long-term growth rates predict growth beyond the Groups planning cycle, and range from 1.7% to 3.5% 2014: 2.5% to 4.5%.
The higher long-term growth rates reflect the weighting of a CGUs operations within China.
The discount rate for each CGU reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the CGU.
Sensitivity analysis None of the reasonable downside sensitivity scenarios on key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of each CGU to exceed its recoverable amount, with the exception of Industry Services.
The sensitivities modelled by management include: i Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2017 to 2020 from the 2016 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with base assumptions.
ii Assuming zero growth in operating profit margins in 2016 to 2020 with revenues increasing per base assumptions.
iii Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%.
Management considers that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.
Impairment At 31 December 2015, before impairment testing, goodwill of 494.6m was allocated to the Industry Services CGU.
The oil and gas sector in which this CGU operates has experienced a significant downturn with a material reduction in capital and operating expenditure by its main customers.
As a result, the Group revised its cash flow forecasts for Industry Services and has therefore reduced the CGU value to its recoverable amount.
This has resulted in an impairment loss against goodwill of 481.4m, against intangible assets of 60.3m and against property, plant and equipment of 35.6m, in total 577.3m.

The intangible assets of 66.9m primarily represent the value placed on customer relationships and the deferred tax thereon was 26.2m.
Consideration paid The total cash consideration paid for the acquisitions in the year was 237.2m 2014: 43.1m.
Including cash and debt acquired of 5.9m, the purchase price was 231.3m.
Contribution of acquisitions to revenue and profits In total acquisitions made during 2015 contributed revenues of 26.8m and a net profit after tax of 2.0m from their respective dates of acquisition to 31 December 2015.
The Group revenue and loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have been 2,377.0m and 330.5m respectively if all the acquisitions were assumed to have been made on 1 January 2015.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 111 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 11 Trade and other receivables ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
Based on historic default rates, reflecting the track record of payments by the Groups customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides fully for all trade receivables over 12 months old as these are considered likely to be irrecoverable, and 25% of balances six to 12 months old.
Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specific trade receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount tobe irrecoverable.
At that time the trade receivable is written off.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade and other receivables are analysed below: 2015 2014 m m Trade receivables 413.7 368.1 Other receivables 57.9 60.0 Prepayments and accrued income 111.8 97.7 Fixed assets held for resale 0.1 0.7 Total trade and other receivables 583.5 526.5 Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for impairment losses of 20.0m 2014: 18.3m and are all expected to be recovered within 12 months.
Impairment on trade receivables charged as part of operating costs was 6.9m 2014: 8.4m.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short-term duration.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number ofcustomers who are internationally dispersed.

INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 113 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting policy Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, facility fees, interest receivable on funds invested, net foreign exchange gains or losses, interest income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue usingthe effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses including bad debt provision.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value at each period end is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted forward price and the exercise price of the contract.
Hedging Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement in the same caption as the foreign exchange on the related item.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group has external borrowings denominated in foreign currencies which are used to hedge the net investment in its foreignoperations.

INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 117 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued FINANCIAL RISKS Details of the Groups treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interestrate and currency risk are set out below, and in the Strategic Report Financial Review that starts on page 34. Credit risk Exposure to credit risk Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group monitors the creditworthiness of customers on an ongoing basis.
The Groups credit risk is diversified due to the large number ofentities, industries and regions that make up the Groups customer base.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
At the reporting date this was as follows: 2015 2014 m m Trade receivables, net of allowance note 11 413.7 368.1 Cash and cash equivalents 116.0 119.5 Total 529.7 487.6 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows: 2015 2014 m m Asia Pacific 111.5 101.4 Americas 160.2 123.6 Europe, Middle East and Africa 142.0 143.1 Total 413.7 368.1 Counterparty risk Cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing facilities are at risk in the event that the counterparty is not able to meet itsobligations in regards to the cash held or facilities available to the Group.
The Group also enters into transactions with counterparties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
If the counterparty was not able to meet its obligations, the Group may be exposed to additional foreign currency or interest rate risk.
The Group, wherever possible, enters into arrangements with counterparties who have robust credit standing, which the Group defines as a financial institution with a credit rating of at least A-.
The Group has existing banking relationships with a number ofrelationship banks that meet this criterion, and seeks to use their services wherever possible while avoiding excessive concentration of credit risk.
Given the diverse geographic nature of the Groups activities, it is not always possible to use a relationship bank.
Therefore the Group has set limits on the level of deposits to be held at non-relationship banks to minimise the risk to the Group.
It is also Group policy to remit any excess funds from local entities back to Intertek Group Treasury in the UK.
Given the controls in place, and based on a current assessment of our banking relationships, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.
The Groups policy is to: ensure sufficient liquidity is available to Group companies in the amounts, currencies and locations required to support the Groups operations: ensure the Group has adequate available sources of funding to protect against unforeseen internal and external events: and avoid excess liquidity which restricts growth and impacts the cost of financing.
To ensure this policy is met, the Group monitors cash balances on a daily basis, projects cash requirements on a rolling basis andfunds itself using debt instruments with a range of maturities.
The following are the contractual cash flows of financial liabilities assets including interest for floating rate instruments, interest payments are based on the interest rate at 31 December 2015 : Carrying Contractual Six months 6-12 More than amount cash flows or less months 1-2 years 2-5 years five years 2015 m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Senior term loans and notes 885.2 1,014.7 52.9 62.8 173.0 420.5 305.5 Other loans 6.2 6.2 6.2 Trade payables note 12 64.7 64.7 63.2 1.5 956.1 1,085.6 116.1 70.5 173.0 420.5 305.5 Derivative financial liabilities assets Forward exchange contracts: Outflow 423.4 366.5 56.9 Inflow 1.6 425.0 367.7 57.3 1.6 1.6 1.2 0.4 Total 954.5 1,084.0 114.9 70.1 173.0 420.5 305.5 Carrying Contractual Six months 6-12 More than amount cash flows or less months 1-2 years 2-5 years five years 2014 m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Senior term loans and notes 752.3 990.5 13.2 103.4 320.4 197.2 356.3 Other loans 0.7 0.7 0.7 Trade payables note 12 42.5 42.3 42.1 0.2 795.5 1,033.5 55.3 104.3 320.4 197.2 356.3 Derivative financial liabilities assets Forward exchange contracts: Outflow 368.5 368.5 Inflow 4.1 372.6 372.6 4.1 4.1 4.1 Total 791.4 1,029.4 51.2 104.3 320.4 197.2 356.3 Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage the risk to the business from movements in interest rates, and to provide stability and predictability of the near term 12 month horizon interest expense.
Under the Groups Treasury policy, management may fix the interest rates on up to 80% of the Groups debt portfolio for the period of the current financial year.
The Groups debt portfolio beyond this period is to be managed within the range of a 20%-60% fixed to floating rate ratio.
To do this the Group uses hedging instruments where considered appropriate.
Sensitivity At 31 December 2015, it is estimated that the impact on variable rate net debt of a general increase of 3% in interest rates would be a decrease in the Groups profit before tax of approximately 4.5m 2014: 6.0m.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 119 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Groups objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Groups financial assets from economic loss due to fluctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies.
The foreign currency profiles of cash, trade receivables and payables subject to translation risk and transaction risk, at the reporting date were as follows: Carrying Chinese Hong Kong Other amount Sterling US dollar renminbi dollar Euro currencies 2015 m m m m m m m Cash 116.0 6.2 13.6 16.4 2.2 1.3 76.3 Trade receivables note 11 413.7 37.7 138.1 37.6 11.2 40.9 148.2 Trade payables note 12 64.7 11.0 15.3 9.0 2.1 8.8 18.5 2014 Cash 119.5 12.8 7.9 25.3 2.4 4.6 66.5 Trade receivables note 11 368.1 39.7 98.1 36.0 10.3 37.5 146.5 Trade payables note 12 42.5 4.6 7.0 4.6 1.6 9.8 14.9 RECOGNISED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2015 was 885.2m 2014: 752.3m.
A foreign exchange loss of 33.1m 2014: loss 42.9m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
SENSITIVITY It is estimated that a general increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2015 by approximately 15.9m 2014: 15.2m.

INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 121 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Employee benefits ACCOUNTING POLICY Pension schemes Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of material defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
The fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
In calculating the defined benefit deficit, the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit credit method.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to the operating profit in the income statement.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland.
TheUnited Kingdom and Hong Kong schemes are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds and the Switzerland scheme is an insured scheme.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.

The Fund uses a combination of traditional assets and investment strategies based on derivatives and is able to take long and short-term positions in markets.
The LDI Fund provides the hedge against adverse movements in inflation and interest rates.
It seeks to match the sensitivity of the Schemes liability cash flow tochanges in interest rates and inflation: it is invested in gilts, swaps, futures, repo contracts and money market instruments.
The United Kingdom Scheme had bank account assets of 0.1m as at 31 December 2015 2014: 0.2m.
All unvested assets of the United Kingdom and Hong Kong Schemes are unquoted.
The Switzerland Scheme is fully insured therefore there are no invested assets.

Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the member, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong Scheme.
The table above shows, for the United Kingdom Scheme, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31December.
The mortality tables adopted in both 2015 and 2014 for the United Kingdom Scheme are the S1PA projected by year of birth, based on the CMI 2013 mortality projection model with a 1.25% long-term annual rate for future improvements.
For the Switzerland Scheme, the mortality table adopted for both 2015 and 2014 is the BVG 2010, anindustry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of major Switzerland pension funds.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The table below sets out the sensitivity on the United Kingdom and Hong Kong pension assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2015 of the two main assumptions: UK Scheme Hong Kong Scheme Increase Increase decrease decrease Liabilities in deficit Liabilities in deficit Change in assumptions m m m m No change 107.8 22.7 0.25% rise in discount rate 102.0 5.8 22.2 0.5 0.25% fall in discount rate 113.7 5.9 23.3 0.6 0.25% rise in inflation 110.6 2.8 22.7 0.25% fall in inflation 104.8 3.0 22.7 The United Kingdom Scheme is also subject to the mortality assumption.
If the mortality tables used are rated up down one year, the value placed on the liabilities increases by 3.0m and decreases by 2.9m respectively.
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS United Kingdom Scheme The trustees use the Projected Unit credit method with a three-year control period.
Currently the scheme members pay contributions at the rate of 8.5% of salary.
The employer pays contributions of 16.4% of salary, plus 0.2m per year to fundscheme expenses, and is due to make an additional contribution of 2.8m in 2016 to reduce the deficit disclosed by the 2013valuation.
Hong Kong Scheme The Trustees use the Attained Age funding method.
The last actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2013.
Scheme members do not contribute to the scheme.
The employer pays contributions of 8.5% of salaries including 0.6% in respect of schemeexpenses.
Funding Risks The main risks for the Schemes are: Investment return risk: If the assets underperform the returns assumed in setting the funding targets then additional contributions may be required at subsequent valuations.
Investment matching risk: The Schemes invest significantly in equities, whereas the funding targets are closely related to thereturns on bonds.
If equities fall in value relative to the matching asset of bonds, additional contributions may be required.
Longevity risk: If future improvements in longevity exceed the assumptions made for Scheme funding then additional contributions may be required.
Role of Third Parties The United Kingdom Scheme is managed by Trustees on behalf of its members.
The Trustees take advice from appropriate third parties including investment advisors, actuaries and lawyers as necessary.

Basis of preparation These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The amendments to FRS 101 2014 15 Cycle issued in July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In these financial statements, the company has adopted FRS 101 for the first time.
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101.
The transition to FRS 101 has not affected the reported financial position and financial performance of the Company.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes: Comparative period reconciliations for share capital Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: Disclosures in respect of capital management: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: an additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy: Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel: and Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures on the basis that the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and lossaccount.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS 101 IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded to the Companys functional currency, Sterling, using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
