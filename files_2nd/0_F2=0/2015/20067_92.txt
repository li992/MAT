Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with FRS 26.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to our 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect profit or loss as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings see note 7.
Forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies are hedged 12 months forward, with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows will be recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were fully effective in the period.
See note 12 for details of the movements in the cash flow hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the 2028 Sterling bond due to movements in market interest rates.
The fair value movement on derivatives designated as hedging instruments in fair value hedges was a credit of 82m 2013 14: charge of 47m.
Other derivatives The companys policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
however, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under FRS 26, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under FRS 26.
