c Impairment testing An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
Consistent with previous years all goodwill, together with CGUs where there were indicators of impairment, was tested for impairment.
An impairment charge of 71 million has been recorded in respect of four CGUs: two in GKN Aerospace, one in GKN Powder Metallurgy and one in Other businesses 2014: 69 million.
An impairment charge in St. Louis, North America Aerospace of 49 million follows a downturn in the market and loss of business during the year.
The charge comprises goodwill of 8 million, development costs of 1 million and property, plant and equipment of 40million.
The remaining recoverable amount of 70 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 12% 2014: 12%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 4 million.
An impairment charge in Astech, North America Aerospace of 14 million follows the loss of key business.
The charge comprises goodwill of 13 million and property, plant and equipment of 1 million.
The remaining recoverable amount of 12million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 12% 2014: 12%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 1 million.
An impairment charge in Sinter Brazil Powder Metallurgy of 6 million follows a significant downturn in the market during the year and loss of future orders.
The charge only comprises property, plant and equipment.
The remaining recoverable amount of 4million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 25% 2014: 25%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows but a 5% change in this assumption would not have impacted the impairment charge.
There was a further impairment charge in Other businesses of 2 million, comprising only goodwill.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued c Impairment testing continued Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates One CGU within the Group, Power Management Devices GKN Land Systems, has continued to be assessed for impairment using an estimation of fair value less costs of disposal based on a multiple of EBITDA and recent comparable market prices.
Due to market conditions in the year and the short term nature of its order book, value in use was not considered to be a representative assessment for impairment testing.
The relevant assets of Power Management Devices have been assessed against fair value less costs of disposal.
The assessment used an assumed EBITDA taking into account past performance, and a market based multiple following a review of comparable companies within a peer group.
Sensitivity analysis on this CGU is provided below.
All other CGUs recoverable amounts were measured using value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
In the case of CGUs within the Groups GKN Aerospace business, value in use was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of those CGUs programmes.
During the year there has been one change in the composition of the Groups CGUs: splitting a CGU in GKN Aerospace North America into twoseparate CGUs based on changes to the business including management team, market approach and contracts, effective from 1January 2015.
One of these two CGUs, Astech, subsequently lost a key contract in the fourth quarter and as a consequence was impaired see page 133.
In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Automotive businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain military and commercial programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of maintaining capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based on long-term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates.
A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
GKN Aerospace: UK 9% 2014: 9%, Europe 8% 2014: 8% and North America 12% 2014: 12% GKN Driveline: North and South America 14%-25% 2014: 14%-25%, Europe 9%-12% 2014: 9%-12% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 10%-20% 2014: 10%-20% GKN Powder Metallurgy: Europe 10% 2014: 10%, North America 14% 2014: 14% and South America 25% 2014: 25% GKN Land Systems: Europe 9%-12% 2014: 9%-12% and North America 14% 2014: 14% Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long-term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five-year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates: GKN Aerospace: UK 3% 2014: 3%, Europe 2% 2014: 2% and North America 3% 2014: 3% GKN Driveline: North and South America 3%-6% 2014: 3%-6%, Europe 2%-4% 2014: 2%-4% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 2%-10% 2014: 2%-10% GKN Powder Metallurgy: Europe 2% 2014: 2% and North America 3% 2014: 3% GKN Land Systems: Europe 2%-4% 2014: 2%-4% and North America 3% 2014: 3% GKN plc 134 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed.
At 31 December 2015, the date of the Groups annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of one CGU within the Groups Aerospace operations using value in use and one CGU within the Groups Land Systems operations using fair value less costs of disposal exceeded their carrying value by 38million and 22 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount rate, long-term growth rate and forecast operating cash flow assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.
