Taxation continued The recognition of deferred tax assets of $1,067 million 2014 $1,467 million, in entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period, is supported by forecasts which indicate that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to utilize such assets.
A summary of temporary differences, unused tax credits and unused tax losses for which deferred tax has not been recognized is shown in the table below.
$ billion At 31 December 2015 2014 a Unused US state tax losses 9.6 9.0 b Unused tax losses other jurisdictions 2.1 2.1 Unused tax credits 20.4 20.1 c of which arising in the UK 17.5 18.0 d arising in the US 2.8 2.0 e Deductible temporary differences 23.2 17.9 Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities 3.9 1.0 a Of the gross unused tax losses on which no deferred tax is recognized, $9.6 billion relates to US state taxes which expire in the period 2016-2035 with applicable tax rates ranging from 5% to 12%.
An amendment has been made to the comparative amount.
b The majority of the unused tax losses have no fixed expiry date.
c The UK unused tax credits arise predominantly in overseas branches of UK entities based in jurisdictions with high tax rates.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future: UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief on the overseas tax.
These tax credits have no fixed expiry date.
d The US unused tax credits expire in the period 2016-2025. e Primarily comprises fixed asset temporary differences.
Substantially all of the temporary differences have no expiry date.

Dividends The quarterly dividend expected to be paid on 24 March 2016 in respect of the fourth quarter 2015 is 10 cents per ordinary share $0.60 per American Depositary Share ADS.
The corresponding amount in sterling will be announced on 14 March 2016.
A scrip dividend alternative is available, allowing shareholders to elect to receive their dividend in the form of new ordinary shares and ADS holders in the form of new ADSs.
2015 2014 2013 Number of shares issued thousand 102,810 165,644 202,124 Value of shares issued $ million 642 1,318 1,470 The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 do not reflect the dividend announced on 2 February 2016 and expected to be paid in March 2016: this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ended 31 December 2016.
Earnings per ordinary share Cents per share 2015 2014 2013 Basic earnings per share 35.39 20.55 123.87 Diluted earnings per share 35.39 20.42 123.12 Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans and excludes treasury shares, which includes shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts ESOPs.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the average number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share.
A dilutive effect relating to potentially issuable shares has not been included, therefore, in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2015.
