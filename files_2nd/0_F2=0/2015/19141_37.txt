STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION Notes to the Company Accounts Notes to the Company Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2015 For the year ended 31 December 2015 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate accounts of the parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments detailed below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In applying these policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The loss of the Company for the year is 53.1m 2014: 88.0m profit, as restated for defined benefit pension described below.
Adoption of FRS 101 The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2015 the Company has changed its accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS 101 as issued by the Financial Reporting Council and has, in doing so, applied the requirements of IFRS 1.6-33 and related appendices.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The prior year financial statements have been restated to recognise the surplus on a defined benefit pension scheme of which certain employees of the Company are members, along with the related deferred tax.
Previously this was not recognised in the accounts of the Company in accordance with the multi-employer exemption allowance under FRS 17.
There are no other prior year restatements arising from the adoption of FRS 101.
A reconciliation of the movement in equity is provided in note 21.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are included within the consolidated accounts.
Leases Leases of tangible fixed assets where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Company are classified as finance leases and the assets are capitalised in the Balance Sheet as plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases of assets where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or to the first review if shorter.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 3 to 5 years The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Software Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is calculated using the straightline method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the Income Statement over its estimated useful life 3 to 7 years.
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are held at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
com 173 173 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the Company Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 1 Accounting policies continued Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified as a loan or receivable, held to maturity or at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the Income Statement.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each Balance Sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
Pensions The Company participates in both the National Express Group Staff Pension Fund a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit scheme, the Balance Sheet position comprises the net of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date and the fair value of plan assets.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised as operating costs.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the profit and loss reserve in the period in which they arise.
For the defined contribution scheme, the amount charged to the profit and loss is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
Share-based payment The Company awards equity-settled share-based payment to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
Non-market-based performance-related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead those non-market conditions are taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and at each Balance Sheet date before vesting.
The cumulative expense is calculated based on that estimate.
Market-based performance conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value and at each Balance Sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated irrespective of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
174 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 174 STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL ADDITIONAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION Notes to the Company Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2015 1 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the profit and loss account.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, including the foreign currency contracts, gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
