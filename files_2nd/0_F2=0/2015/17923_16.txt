1 Strategic Report continued 1.12.3 Copper Business Description of the Copper Business Our assets consist of the following: Escondida Chile Our 57.5 per cent owned and operated Escondida mine is a leading producer of copper.
Located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, Escondida employs approximately 12,000 operational employees and contractors and has the capacity to move in excess of 1.3 million tonnes Mt of material per day.
Its two open-cut pits currently feed three concentrator plants, which use grinding and flotation technologies to produce copper concentrate, as well as two leaching operations oxide and sulphide.
In FY2015, total Escondida production was 916.1 kilotonnes kt of payable copper in concentrate and 310.4 kt of copper cathode.
Our Copper Business, headquartered in Santiago, Pampa Norte Chile Chile, is one of the worlds leading producers of copper Pampa Norte consists of two wholly owned operations in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile Spence and Cerro Colorado.
concentrate and cathode, uranium oxide, and a During FY2015, Spence produced 171.4 kt of high-quality copper producer of zinc concentrate.
Our portfolio of mining cathode, using oxide and sulphide ore treatment through leaching, operations includes the Escondida mine in Chile, solvent extraction and electrowinning processes.
Although a leading producer of copper, and Olympic Dam production levels at Cerro Colorado have fallen in recent years in South Australia, a major producer of copper and as grades have declined, production in FY2015 reached 78.2 kt uranium oxide.
A project currently being studied, referred to as the Spence Growth Option SGO, is being conducted to consider exploiting the large and expandable hypogene resource with associated molybdenum sulphide by building a 95 kilotonnes Results per day ktpd concentrator at the Spence operation.
SGO would extend the mine life by approximately 50 years beyond the 2015 2014 2013 US$M US$M US$M current CY2025 closure date.

cathode and uranium oxide and a refiner of gold and silver bullion.
The site includes an underground mine, where the primary method of ore extraction is long-hole open stoping with cemented aggregate fill, and an integrated metallurgical processing plant.
The underground mine extracts copper uranium ore and hauls the ore by an automated train and trucking network feeding underground crushing, storage and ore hoisting facilities.
The processing plant consists of two grinding circuits in which high-quality copper concentrate is extracted from sulphide ore through a flotation extraction process.
The operation includes a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding and concentrating circuit, a hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, a copper refinery and a recovery circuit for precious metals.
The Svedala mill, which accounts for approximately 60 per cent of Olympic Dams production, experienced an electrical failure in January 2015.
Repairs were completed by June 2015 and the mill is now operating at full capacity.
In FY2015, Olympic Dam produced 124.5 kt of copper cathode, 3.1 kt of uranium oxide, 104.8 kilo-ounces koz of refined gold and 724 koz of refined silver.

Price impact net of price-linked costs for Copper Escondida reduced Underlying EBIT by US$1.6 billion due to lower average The Organic Growth Project 1 OGP1 is a new concentrator realised prices for copper from US$3.22 lb to US$2.78 lb.
We expect this project to provide additional increase in non-cash costs of US$839 million largely reflects processing capacity and allow access to higher-grade ore.
