Articles of Association Articles The following is a summary of the principal provisions of BTs Articles, a copy of which has been filed with the Registrar of Companies.
New Articles of Association were adopted on 5 August 2010, largely to take account of changes in UK company law brought about by the Companies Act 2006 2006 Act.
Under the 2006 Act, the Memorandum of Association serves a more limited role as historical evidence of the formation of the company.
Since August 2010, the provisions in relation to objects in BTs Memorandum are deemed to form part of BTs Articles, and have been deleted from those Articles because of shareholders passing a resolution to this effect.
Under the 2006 Act, BTs objects are unrestricted.
