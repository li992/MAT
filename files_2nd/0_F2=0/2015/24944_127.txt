24 Trading liabilities Accounting policy Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they have been acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking.
They are recognised on trade date, when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties, and are normally derecognised when extinguished.
They are initially measured at fair value, with transaction costs taken to the income statement.
Subsequent changes in fair value and interest are recognised in the income statement in Net trading income.
