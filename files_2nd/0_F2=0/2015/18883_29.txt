Shareholder information continued Forward-looking statements Certain statements included in this Annual Report and Accounts are forward-looking and should be considered, amongst other statutory provisions, in light of the safe harbour provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All statements other than historical facts may be forward-looking statements.
Such statements are therefore subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied because they relate to future events.
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of relevant terminology including the words: believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, goal, target, aim, may, will, would, could or should or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology and include all matters that are not historical facts.
They appear in a number of places throughout this Annual Report and Accounts and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations and those of our officers, directors and employees concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations, financial condition, changes in tax rates, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the businesses we operate.
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, global economic business conditions, monetary and interest rate policies, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices, the impact of competition, inflation and deflation, changes to regulations, taxes and legislation, changes to consumer saving and spending habits: and our success in managing these factors.
Consequently, our actual future financial condition, performance and results could differ materially from the plans, goals and expectations set out in our forward-looking statements.
Reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statement.
The forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date of this Annual Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
