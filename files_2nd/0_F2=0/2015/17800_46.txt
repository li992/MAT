As at 31 December 2014, the Group held a 17.2% stake in Duluth Metals Limited Duluth, accounted for as an available-for-sale investment.
As at 31 December 2014, Duluth held a 60% interest in Twin Metals Minnesota Limited Twin Metals, with the Group holding the remaining 40% interest in Twin Metals.
As disclosed in Note 19, in November 2014 Antofagasta entered into a binding letter of agreement to acquire 100% of Duluth.
The acquisition completed subsequent to the 2014 year end following approval from Duluths shareholders in January 2015.
Movements in the fair value of the available-for-sale investment in Duluth had previously been recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The agreed acquisition terms indicated a final fixed value for the Duluth shares, and that there had therefore been an impairment in the value of the Duluth shares to this amount.
Accordingly, an impairment charge of $26.3 million was recognised in 2014 in respect of this available-for-sale investment, with fair value losses previously recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income being transferred to the income statement and recognised within this impairment loss.
This impairment change was largely offset by the related $28.6 million disposal gain recognised in 2014 in respect of the temporary loss of control of the Twin Metals project as set out in Note 17.
The fair value through profit or loss line represents the fair value gains relating to liquid investments.

Withholding tax is levied on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category ie corporate tax already paid in respect of the profits to which the remittances relate.
On 29 September 2014, a significant reform of the Chilean system was enacted into law.
This introduced two alternative future taxation systems the partially-integrated system the default system for the Groups Chilean subsidiaries or the attributable system.
The Group has been accounting for deferred tax on the basis that it would apply the default partially-integrated system.
On 1 February 2016, a Simplification ofthe Tax Reform was enacted into law.
This specifies that for entities such as the Groups Chilean subsidiaries, whose members are corporate entities and not individual persons, only the partially-integrated system can be applied.
Given that the Group has already been accounting for deferred tax on the basis that it would apply the default partially-integrated system this has not resulted in any accounting impact for the Group.
Under the partially-integrated system the corporate tax rate will be 25.5% in 2017 and 27% from 2018 onwards.
The immediate shareholders of the Chilean subsidiaries will pay withholding tax based on the cash distributions made by those subsidiary companies, as with the current tax system.
If the subsidiary companys shareholders are tax resident in countries with applicable tax treaties with Chile as is the case for the Group the withholding tax will be 35%, less first category tax at the rate it was paid, so if the Company distributes all of its earnings the total corporate and withholding tax burden will be 35%.
The Groups mining operations are also subject to a mining tax royalty.
Production from Los Pelambres, the Tesoro Central and Mirador pits at Centinela Cathodes and Michilla are currently subject to a rate of 4% of taxable operating profit and Centinela Concentrates of 5%, and production from the Tesoro North East pit and the run-of-mine processing at Centinela Cathodes is subject to a rate of between 514%, depending on the level of operating profit margin.

In 2015 the effective tax rate varied from the statutory rateprincipally due to tax losses which under Chilean tax carry-back rules generated a credit at historic tax rates below the current year statutory rate impact of $25.8 million 9.9%, the effect of expenses not deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes principally the funding of expenses outside of Chile impact of $17.1 million 6.6% and the mining tax impact of $34.0 million 13.1% and withholding tax charge impact of $14.8 million 5.7%.
In 2014, the effective tax rate varied from the standard rate comprising corporate first category tax principally due to the one-off deferred tax charge of $215.1 million reflecting the increase in tax rates as a result of the Chilean tax reform enacted inthat year.
There are no significant tax uncertainties which would require critical judgements, estimates or potential provisions.
