Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc the company is apublic company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The company financial statements are presented on pages 160 to 180.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value notes 1.13 and 1.17.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in this note and, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
1.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries and special purpose entities, together the group, made up to 31 December each year.
The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries and special purpose entities are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained, and no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases: their results are included in the consolidated financial statements up to the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are companies over which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of the associate note 1.5.
For associates with non-coterminous year ends, financial statements are drawn up to 31 December for the purposes of equity accounting.
1.3 Developments in reporting standards and interpretations Standards and interpretations affecting the reported results or the financial position In the current year, the group has adopted IFRIC 21 Levies.
IFRIC 21 Levies changes the point at which the group recognises aliability in respect of Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS levies.
From 1 January 2015, the group has recognised aliability in respect of FSCS levies from the date at which the triggering event specified in the legislation occurs.
The triggering event for recognition of FSCS levies has changed from 31 December of the preceding financial year to 1 April of the current financial year, resulting in levies recognised in the previous financial year being derecognised and recognised in the current financial year.
Comparatives have been restated for the impact of the change.
As at 1 January 2014, retained earnings brought forward have been increased by 498,000.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, profit after tax has been increased by 41,000, total assets have been reduced by 147,000 and total liabilities have been reduced by 686,000.
No other standards or interpretations, new or revised, have been adopted in the current year.
Future new standards and interpretations A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after 1 January 2015 and, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers are not expected to become mandatory for periods commencing before 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases is not expected to become mandatory for periods commencing before 1 January 2019.
These standards have not yet been adopted by the EU and the group does not plan to adopt these standards early.

3 Developments in reporting standards and interpretations IFRS 9 Financial Instruments could change the classification and measurement of financial assets and the timing and extent of credit provisioning.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers could change how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers.
The extent of their impact has not yet been fully determined.
IFRS 16 Leases eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases.
The group will be required to recognise all leases with aterm of more than 12 months as alease asset on its balance sheet: the group will also recognise afinancial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments.
The extent of its impact has not yet been fully determined.
1.4 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from acontingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values may arise as aresult of additional information obtained after this date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Provided they arise within 12 months of the acquisition date, these changes are measurement period adjustments and are reflected against the cost of acquisition.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from events occurring after the acquisition date are charged to profit or loss or other comprehensive income, except for obligations that are classified as equity, which are not remeasured.
Such changes are irrespective of the 12 month period from acquisition.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, which are measured in accordance with applicable accounting policies described elsewhere in this note.
1.5 Investments in associates Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
1.6 Going concern The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, areasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence.
In forming this view, the directors have considered the companys and the groups prospects for aperiod exceeding 12 months.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.7 Foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of the company and its subsidiaries is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in profit or loss for the year.
1.8 Income Net interest income Interest income or expense from interest-bearing financial instruments, except those classified as held for trading, is calculated using the effective interest method and recognised within net interest income.
Dividends received from money market funds are included in net interest income when received.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 101 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.
8 Income The effective interest method is the method of calculating the amortised cost of afinancial asset or liability or group of assets and liabilities and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the expected future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or when appropriate, ashorter period, to the net carrying amount of the instrument.
The application of the method has the effect of recognising income or expense receivable or payable on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment.
In calculating effective interest, the group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but excluding the impact of future credit losses.
Net fee and commission income Portfolio or asset management fees, trail commissions receivable or payable and fees from advisory services are recognised on acontinuous basis over the period that the related service is provided.
Commission charges for executing transactions on behalf of clients are recognised when the transaction is dealt.
Initial charges receivable from the sale of unit holdings in the groups collective investment schemes and related rebates are recognised at the point of sale.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when received.
1.9 Operating leases Lease agreements which do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets to the group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on astraight line basis over the term of the lease.
The impact of any lease incentives is spread over the term of the lease.
1.10 Share-based payments The group engages in cash-settled and equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from its employees.
Equity-settled awards For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the award is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the grant date.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in profit or loss over the vesting period, with acorresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the awards or options granted is determined using abinomial pricing model, which takes into account the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option or award, any applicable exercise price and other relevant factors.
Only those vesting conditions that include terms related to market conditions are taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that, ultimately, the amount recognised in profit or loss reflects the number of vested shares or share options, with acorresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market-related vesting condition is met, provided that any non-market vesting conditions are also met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
Cash-settled awards For cash-settled share-based payments, aliability is recognised for the services received to the balance sheet date, measured at the fair value of the liability.
At each subsequent balance sheet date and at the date on which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
1.11 Taxation Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on net taxable income for the year.
Current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
102 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.11 Taxation Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for under the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised, except where the temporary difference arises: from the initial recognition of goodwill: from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in atransaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, other than in abusiness combination: or in relation to investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is the groups intention not to reverse the temporary difference in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on anet basis.
1.12 Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand.
Cash equivalents comprise money market funds which are realisable on demand and loans and advances to banks with amaturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
1.13 Financial assets Initial recognition Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
Classification and subsequent valuation Financial assets are classified in the following categories: At fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified in this category if they are held for trading, or if they are designated in this category by the group.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to profit or loss.
Derivatives are categorised as held for trading.
Fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are included in assets when their fair value is positive, and in liabilities when their fair value is negative, unless the company has the legal ability and intention to settle net.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the group provides money, goods or services to adebtor or purchases aloan or other debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method note 1.8, less any impairment.
If the fair value of the loan on initial recognition is lower than the amount advanced, the shortfall is charged to profit or loss.
Held to maturity Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables or that the group has classified as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss that the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method note 1.8, less any impairment.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 103 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.
13 Financial assets Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available for sale investments include those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity.
When the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit or loss.
Trade date accounting Financial assets, excluding loans and receivables, are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the group commits to purchase the asset.
Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Fair value measurement The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If an active market for afinancial asset does not exist, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that afinancial asset carried at amortised cost, or agroup of such financial assets, has suffered an impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset, or group of assets, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
The group measures the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset, or group of assets, and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset, or group of assets, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset, or group of assets, at initial recognition.
The present value of estimated future cash flows excludes the impact of future credit losses that have not been incurred.
Any impairment loss isrecognised in profit or loss.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as aresult of anew event, the relevant element of the outstanding impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount asreduced by an allowance for impairment.
Financial assets carried at fair value When adecline in the fair value of afinancial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss.
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset and its current fair value.
Impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through profit or loss, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to asubsequent event.
104 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.14 Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, which includes directly attributable acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: leasehold improvements: over the lease term plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to 10 years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals aredetermined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and these are included in profit or loss.
1.15 Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises through business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest inthe fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of abusiness at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is allocated to groups of cash generating units.
Cash generating units are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of asubsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, being the date of the groups transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP carrying amounts and is tested for impairment annually.
Client relationships Client relationships acquired as part of abusiness combination are initially recognised at fair value note 1.4.
Determining whether atransaction that involves the purchase of client relationships is treated as abusiness combination or aseparate purchase of intangible assets requires judgement.
The factors that the group takes into consideration in making this judgement are set out in note 2.1.
Individually purchased client relationships are initially recognised at cost.
Where atransaction to acquire client relationship intangibles includes an element of variable deferred consideration, an estimate is made of the value of consideration that will ultimately be paid.
The client relationship intangible recognised on the balance sheet is adjusted for any subsequent change in the value of deferred consideration.
Note 2.1 sets out the approach taken by the group where judgement is required to determine whether payments made for the introduction of client relationships should be capitalised as intangible assets or charged to profit or loss.
Client relationships are subsequently carried at the amount initially recognised less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives normally 10 to 15 years, but not more than 15 years.
Computer software and software development costs Costs incurred to acquire and bring to use computer software licences are capitalised and amortised through profit or loss over their expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the group is expected to benefit from future use of the software and the costs are reliably measurable.
Other costs of producing software are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 105 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.16 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using apre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the groups cash generating units.
The carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared to its value-in-use, calculated using adiscounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Client relationship intangibles are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of funds under management for each acquired client relationship or, for client relationships acquired with abusiness combination, each acquired portfolio of clients with their associated amortised value.
An example of evidence of impairment would be lost client relationships.
In determining whether aclient relationship is lost, the group considers factors such as the level of funds withdrawn and the existence of other retained family relationships.
When client relationships are lost, the full amount of unamortised cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss and the intangible asset is derecognised.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
1.17 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and classified as fair value through profit or loss if designated as such or if held for trading or at amortised cost.
The group derecognises financial liabilities when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
The group has not designated any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and holds no liabilities as held for trading.
Deposits and borrowings After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings, except deposits on demand, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method through net interest income note 1.8.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
Deposits on demand continue to be held at face value.
1.18 Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when the group has apresent obligation legal or constructive as aresult of apast event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits, that can be reliably estimated, will occur.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, discounted using apre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that depend on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the likelihood of crystallisation is judged to be remote.
106 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies 1.19 Retirement benefit obligations on retirement benefit schemes The groups net liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price are deducted.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Net remeasurements of the defined benefit liability are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately in the period of aplan amendment.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet for death in service benefits represents the present value of the estimated obligation, reduced by the extent to which any future liabilities will be met by insurance policies.
Contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to profit or loss as an expense as they fall due.
The company determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability.
1.20 Segmental reporting The group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the executive committee, which is the groups chief operating decision maker.
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to clients: adescription of the services provided by each segment is given in our approach on pages 11 to 15.
No operating segments have been aggregated in the groups financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are reported within the income or expenses for those segments: intra-segment income and expenditure is eliminated at group level.
Indirect costs are allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by each segment.
1.21 Fiduciary activities The group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
Such assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the group.
Largely as aresult of cash and settlement processing, the group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Jersey Financial Services Commission and the Solicitors Accounts Rules issued by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, as applicable.
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the group is not beneficially entitled to them.
1.22 Financial guarantees The group provides alimited number of financial guarantees, which are backed by assets in clients portfolios.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the guarantee.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 107 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
2.1 Client relationship intangibles note 22 Client relationship intangibles purchased through corporate transactions When the group purchases client relationships through transactions with other corporate entities, ajudgement is made as to whether the transaction should be accounted for as abusiness combination or as aseparate purchase of intangible assets.
In making this judgement, the group assesses the assets, liabilities, operations and processes that were the subject of the transaction against the definition of abusiness in IFRS 3.
In particular, consideration is given to the scale of the operations subject to the transaction, whether ownership of acorporate entity has been acquired and to whom any amounts payable under the transaction are payable, among other factors.
Payments to newly recruited investment managers The group assesses whether payments made to newly recruited investment managers under contractual agreements represent payments for the acquisition of client relationship intangibles or remuneration for ongoing services provided to the group.
Payments made for the acquisition of client relationship intangibles are capitalised whereas those that are judged to be in relation to the provision of ongoing services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
The group determines asuitable period during which awards accruing to new investment managers are capitalised.
Typically, this will be for the period ending up to 12 months after the cessation of any non-compete period.
After the defined period has elapsed, any payments made are charged to profit or loss.
During the year the group capitalised 11,308,000 of payments made to investment managers and expensed 3,254,000 2014: 22,073,000 capitalised and 2,824,000 expensed.
Areduction in the capitalisation period by one month would decrease client relationship intangibles by 256,000 and decrease profit before tax by 256,000 2014: 257,000 and 257,000 respectively.
Amortisation of client relationship intangibles The group makes estimates as to the expected duration of client relationships to determine the period over which related intangible assets are amortised.
The amortisation period is estimated with reference to historical data on account closure rates and expectations for the future.
During the year client relationship intangible assets were amortised over a10 to 15 year period.
Amortisation of 11,094,000 2014: 8,287,000 was charged during the year.
Areduction in the average amortisation period of one year would increase the amortisation charge by approximately 1,000,000 2014: 700,000.
At 31 December 2015, thecarrying value of client relationship intangibles was 100,869,000 2014: 95,720,000.
2.2 Retirement benefit obligations note 28 The group makes estimates about arange of long term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the surplus or deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
Long term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 4,501,000 2014: 13,710,000 and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligations to changes in underlying estimates are set out in note 28.
108 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty 2.3 Business combinations note 35 During the year, the group entered into atransaction to acquire the remaining 80.1% of Vision Independent Financial Planning Limited and Castle Investment Solutions Limited the Vision businesses, having already acquired 19.9% in 2012.
The group has accounted for the transaction as abusiness combination, as set out in note 35.
Treatment and fair value of consideration transferred The purchase price payable in respect of the acquisition is split into anumber of different components.
The payment of certain elements has been deferred: the timing and value of these are contingent on certain employment conditions and or operational targets being met.
The proportion of the deferred payments that are contingent on selling shareholders remaining employed by the group for aspecific period are accounted for as remuneration for ongoing services in employment.
The groups estimate of the amounts ultimately payable will be expensed over the deferral period.
Those deferred payments accounted for as additional consideration were assessed against the operational targets to which they are subject.
Based on performance against the operational targets to date, there is no evidence to suggest that these payments would be delayed or reduced.
Therefore, aprovision for contingent consideration has been made for the maximum amount expected to be paid, with amounts payable after one year discounted to their present value.
Remeasurement to fair value of non-controlling interest The stepped nature of the acquisition requires the group to remeasure its pre-existing equity interest in the two entities at its acquisition date fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss in profit or loss.
The fair value was determined using  discounted cash flow model.
The fair value of the pre-existing 19.9% holding was calculated as 2,369,000, and again arising on remeasurement of 885,000 was recognised.
The assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model are the growth in the number of IFAs associated with the Vision businesses, the assets under advisement generated by those IFAs and the discount rate used.
Areduction in the discount rate of2.5 percentage points would increase the fair value of the pre-existing holding by 338,000.
Identification of assets acquired and liabilities assumed As at 31 December 2015, the date of acquisition, the Vision businesses identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been recognised at their fair value.
In accordance with the process described in note 2.1, the group has recognised aclient relationship intangible of 4,539,000, arising from the Vision businesses relationship with clients whose assets are managed via the panel of discretionary fund managers.
Goodwill of 5,911,000 has been recognised in accordance with note 1.15.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 109 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Segmental information For management purposes the group is currently organised into two operating segments: Investment Management and Unit Trusts.
The products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are described in note 1.20.
All services other than unit trust funds and multi asset funds are reported within the Investment Management segment.
These segments are the basis on which the group reports its performance to the executive committee, which is the groups chief operating decision maker.
Certain items of income are presented within different categories of operating income in the financial statements compared to the presentation for internal reporting.
Staff costs for internal reporting purposes include only those staff directly involved in the provision of the services from which each segments revenue is generated.

The Finance Bill 2015, which included provisions for the UK corporation tax rate to be reduced to 19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020, received royal assent in November 2015, and the reductions are therefore deemed to be substantively enacted.
Deferred tax balances have therefore been calculated based on these reduced rates as future timing differences are forecast to unwind.

The group was deemed to exercise significant influence over the associates by virtue of its contractual right to appoint one director to the board of directors of both companies.
However, the group was not judged to have control by virtue of having no rights which would allow it to be exercised.
On 31 December 2015, the group increased its shareholding in Vision and Castle to 100% see note 35, and the companies became subsidiaries as of that date.
The movements in the groups investment in associates up to 31 December 2015 were as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 At 1 January 1,434 1,296 Share of profit 157 169 Dividends received 107 31 Gain on remeasurement to fair value see note 35 885 Business combination see note 35 2,369 At 31 December 1,434 Prior to the acquisition of the remaining 80.1% of the two companies, the group remeasured its existing 19.9% holdings to fair value immediately prior to acquisition, recognising again of 885,000.
The following table summarises the financial performance of the associates during the year: 2015 2014 Vision Castle Vision Castle 000 000 000 000 Revenue 1,651 977 1,317 918 Total comprehensive income 281 518 313 534 Groups share of total comprehensive income 55 102 62 107 At 31 December 2015, the groups associates had the following assets and liabilities: 2015 2014 Vision Castle Vision Castle 000 000 000 000 Assets 1,205 791 Liabilities 423 16 Net assets 782 775 Derivative financial instruments As part of the transaction to acquire the original 19.9% holdings, the group was party to certain option contracts over the equity instruments of the associates.
Under these contracts, the group had the right to acquire the remaining 80.1% of the share capital of both companies for avariable exercise price in the third quarter of 2015.
On 30 September 2015, the group signed an agreement to acquire the remaining 80.1% of the share capital of Vision and Castle.
The agreement materially amended the terms of the transaction and superseded the option contracts: the carrying value of which was written down to nil, realising aloss of 1,030,000.

Thegoodwill has been allocated to the investment management CGU see note 35.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are assessed using value-in-use calculations.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming and future years.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that, absent evidence to the contrary, organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins will be in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will not change in the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years based on annual revenue growth for each CGU see table below, as well as the groups expectation of future industry growth rates.
A10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on the groups assessment of the likely associated duration of client relationships.
The group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is shown in the table below: these are based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The group judges that these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax and Rooper & Whately CGUs.
Investment management Trust and tax Rooper & Whately At 31 December 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Discount rate 9.0% 11.0% 11.0% 13.0% 9.0% 13.0% Annual revenue growth rate 8.0% 7.0% 0.0% 1.5% 0.0% 5.0% Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 125 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 22 Intangible assets At 30 June 2015, the group recognised an impairment charge of 316,000 in relation to goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU.
An impairment was recognised as the recoverable amount of the CGU at 30 June 2015 was 1,288,000, which was lower than the carrying value of 1,604,000 at 31 December 2014.
The recoverable amount at 30 June 2015 was calculated based on forecast earnings for 2015, extrapolated over 10 years based on an annual revenue growth rate of 1.0%.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 13%.
The impairment was recognised in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis.
No further impairment was recognised at 31 December 2015.
Based on the assumptions in the table above, the calculated recoverable amount of the trust and tax CGU at 31 December 2015 was 1,592,000: this was higher than its carrying value of 1,288,000.
Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax CGU by two percentage points would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to 798,000.
Noreasonably foreseeable changes to the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for the investment management CGU would result in an impairment of the goodwill allocated to it.
Purchases of client relationships in the year relate to payments made to investment managers and third parties for the introduction of client relationships.
The total amount charged to profit or loss in the year, in relation to goodwill and client relationships, was 11,014,000 2014: 8,287,000.
Afurther 3,254,000 2014: 2,824,000 was expensed as staff costs during the year, representing amounts due for client relationships introduced more than 12 months after the cessation of any non-compete period note 2.1.

The fair value of deposits by banks was not materially different to their carrying value.
Fair value has been calculated as the discounted amount of estimated future cash flows expected to be paid using current market rates.

The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, which include non-interest-bearing deposits, is the amount at which deposits could be transferred to athird party at the measurement date.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for new debts with similar remaining maturity.

These amounts have been capitalised see note 22.
At 31 December 2015, deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles includes 4,389,000 in relation to the purchase of part of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Managements London-based private client investment management business on 5 June 2014 2014: 11,132,000.
This is the final amount payable and is based on the value of funds under management retained by the group at 31 December 2015.
The remainder of the balance is payable to anumber of investment management teams, who have joined over the past two years.
Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations Deferred and contingent consideration of 4,145,000 2014: nil is payable in instalments up to the end of 2019 following the acquisition of Vision and Castle.
The payments are contingent on certain operational and financial targets being met see note 35.
The group has estimated the size and timing of the amounts payable by taking into account the expected outcome of the conditions attached to the payments.
The group has discounted the amounts payable after one year.
In 2014, business combinations included aprovision of 32,000,000, being the minimum consideration payable for the acquisition of Jupiter Asset Management Limiteds private client and charity investment business.
This provision was utilised following the completion of this acquisition on 26 September 2014.
128 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Other provisions Legal and compensation During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time-to-time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties both in the UK and overseas.
Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring aliability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that apayment will be made, aprovision is established to the groups best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties.
Property-related Property-related provisions consist of 1,795,000 in relation to dilapidation provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group 2014: 1,082,000.
Dilapidation provisions are calculated using adiscounted cash flow model.
During the year, provisions have increased by 713,000 2014: 109,000 due to the change in estimated cost of dilapidations, and timing thereof, at our existing London office and the impact of discounting.
Ageing of provisions Provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within four years of the balance sheet date 2014: two years, except for property-related provisions of 1,783,000 2014: 1,071,000, which are expected to be settled within 21 years of the balance sheet date 2014: 22 years, which corresponds to the longest lease for which adilapidations provision is being held.

28 Long term employee benefits The group operates adefined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to these schemes during the year was 4,160,000 2014: 3,299,000.
The group also operates adefined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 31,000 2014: 14,000.

The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on adiscretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The group has apolicy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 129 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Long term employee benefits The group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 1,028,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2014: 880,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to apresent value using arate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2013 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2013 The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from arange of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2015 2014 2015 2014 Laurence Keen Laurence Keen Rathbone 1987 Rathbone 1987 Scheme % Scheme % Scheme % Scheme % Rate of increase of salaries 4.20 4.10 4.20 4.10 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.50 3.40 3.10 3.10 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.20 3.10 3.20 3.10 Discount rate 4.00 3.80 4.00 3.80 Inflation 3.20 3.10 3.20 3.10 Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Prices Index Over the prior year the financial assumptions have been amended to reflect changes in market conditions.
Specifically: i t he discount rate has been increased by 0.2% to reflect an increase in the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds at aterm consistent with the average duration of the liabilities: ii the assumed rate of future inflation has been increased by 0.1% to reflect an increase in expectations of long-term inflation as implied by changes in the fixed interest and index-linked gilts market: and iii the assumed rates of salary growth and future increases to pensions in payment have been increased for consistency with the change in the assumed rate of future inflation.
The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 19 years 2014: 19 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 23 years 2014: 23 years.
The normal retirement age for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme is 65 60 for certain former directors.
The normal retirement age for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 60 for service prior to 1 July 2009 and 65 thereafter, following the introduction of pension benefits based on Career Average Revalued Earnings from that date.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the S2NA actuarial tables 2014: S2NA tables.
The assumed life expectations on retirement were: 2015 2014 Males Females Males Females Years Years Years Years Retiring today: aged 60 29.2 31.4 29.1 31.3 aged 65 24.2 26.4 24.2 26.3 Retiring in 20 years: aged 60 31.6 33.8 31.5 33.7 aged 65 26.5 28.6 26.4 28.5 There were no changes to the demographic assumptions over the year.

They require that the assets of the schemes are invested in adiversified portfolio of assets, split between return seeking assets primarily equities and safer assets gilts, index-linked gilts, corporate bonds and other fixed income investments with aswitch to agreater percentage of safer assets over time as the schemes mature.
In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2048.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 133 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28 Long term employee benefits All equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.
The majority of government bonds are issued by governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Sweden and Japan all of which are rated AAA, AA or A, based on credit ratings awarded by Fitch or Moodys as at the balance sheet date.
Other scheme assets comprise commodities and property funds, both of which also have quoted prices in active markets.
The four key assumptions affecting the results of the valuation are the discount rate, future inflation, future salary growth and mortality.
In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme by varying each of these assumptions in isolation whilst leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
Asummary of the sensitivities in respect of the total of the two schemes defined benefit obligations are set out below.

Following the recent triennial valuations, from 1 January 2015, the group has made regular contributions of 20.3% of pensionable salaries and the group has committed to make additional contributions to the scheme of 2,750,000 in 2016 and 500,000 in 2017, if the scheme remains in deficit at the time of the payment.
Active members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme are required to make annual contributions to the scheme.
Currently, these contributions represent an average of 7.8% of pensionable salaries 2014: 7.8%.
With effect from 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 137 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Financial risk management The group has identified the financial, business and operational risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the group risk committee report on page 69.
The group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk andprice risk : and iv pension risk.
The groups exposures to pension risk are set out in note 28.
The groups financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the group faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The group regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in agroup treasury manual and policy documents prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that acounterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market and holding interest-bearing securities.
The group also has exposure to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with arange of high-quality financial institutions and the Bank of England.
Investments with financial institutions are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Limited Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
The groups financial assets are categorised as follows: Balances with central banks note 14 The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where apayment in cash or transfer of asecurity is made in the expectation of acorresponding delivery of asecurity or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on adelivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within avery close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on adaily basis.
138 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Financial risk management i Credit risk The Investment Management and Unit Trusts segments have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.

Loans and advances to banks note 15 and debt and other securities note 17 The group has exposures to awide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and, in 2015, treasury bills.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients cash, where it is held under abanking relationship, and the groups own reserves.
The groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded aminimum long term rating of single A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on adaily basis by the treasury department and reviewed by the banking committee on amonthly basis, or more frequently when necessary.
The banking committee may suspend dealing in aparticular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers note 16 The group provides loans to clients through its investment management operations the investment management loan book.
The group is also exposed to credit risk on overdrafts on clients investment management accounts, trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and pensions advisory businesses trust and pension debtors and other debtors.
a Overdrafts O verdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time-to-time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on aclients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on amonthly basis.
b Investment management loan book L oans are provided as aservice to investment management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on afully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name, and some loans may be partially secured by property.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
T he banking committee reviews all loans on amonthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where possible, repayment plans are established with clients before loans become overdue or uncovered.
A t 31 December 2015, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was 150,000,000 2014: 150,000,000, of which 111,682,000 had been advanced 2014: 97,201,000 and afurther 20,417,000 had been committed 2014: 14,634,000. c Trust and pension debtors T rust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on amonthly basis by the management committees of the groups trust and pension advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers relate to management fees receivable.
Derivative financial instruments note 21 At 31 December 2014, the group held derivative financial instruments in the form of the option contracts in relation to the shares in the groups associates.

The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors, are set out in note 16.

The primary objective of the groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
In addition to setting the treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management the Bank performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that asignificant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over ashort period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
144 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Financial risk management ii Liquidity risk Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and regulatory ratios using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
Aminimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the board at least annually in conjunction with an amount prescribed by the PRA.
Non-derivative cash flows The table below presents the undiscounted cash flows receivable and payable by the group under non-derivative financial assets and liabilities analysed by the remaining contractual maturities at the balance sheet date.
Included within the amounts due to customers on demand are balances which historical experience shows are unlikely to be called in the short term.
Aprudent level of highly liquid assets is retained to cover reasonably foreseeable short term changes in client deposits.
All debt securities are readily marketable and can be realised through disposals.
The group holds 1,070,000 of equity investments 2014: 514,000 which are subject to liquidity risk but are not included in the table above.
These assets are held as available for sale securities and have no fixed maturity date: cash flows arise from receipt of dividends or through sale of the assets.
Off-balance sheet items Cash flows arising from the groups off-balance sheet financial liabilities note 34 are summarised in the table below.
The contractual value of the groups commitments to extend credit to clients and maximum potential value of financial guarantees are analysed by the duration of the commitment.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are reported by their contractual payment dates.
Capital commitments are summarised by the earliest expected date of payment.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of afinancial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is rising and shortens it when the yield curve is falling.
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest-bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on acorresponding amount of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2015, an immediate 2% increase in interest rates across the yield curve would increase annual interest income by 2,365,000 2014: 2,909,000.
The group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2015 2014: none.
Foreign exchange risk The group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on adaily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time-to-time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to aminimal amount.
The group has no structural foreign currency exposure.
148 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Financial risk management iii Market risk The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2015.

A10% weakening of the euro against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2015, would have reduced equity and profit after tax by 25,000 2014: reduced by 12,000.
A10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of afinancial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 17.
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 1,070,000 2014: 514,000.
A10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in apre-tax decrease to net assets of 60,000 2014: 31,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into afair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2015 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 1,070 1,070 money market funds 52,316 52,316 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2014 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 514 514 money market funds 15,000 15,000 Derivative financial instruments 1,030 1,030 514 15,000 1,030 16,544 The group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2014: none.
The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
150 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Financial risk management iii Market risk Changes in the fair values of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy were as follows: 2015 2014 Available for Derivative Available for Derivative sale equity financial sale equity financial securities instruments Total securities instruments Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 1,030 1,030 691 1,030 1,721 Total unrealised gains and losses recognised in: profit or loss note 21 1,030 1,030 other comprehensive income 245 245 Disposals 936 936 At 31 December 1,030 1,030 Losses relating to the derivative financial instruments are included within loss on derivative financial instruments and gains relating to the available for sale equity securities are included within revaluation of available for sale investment securities in other comprehensive income.
There were no other gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of the groups other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of the following: Held to maturity investment debt securities note 17 comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons and, in 2015, treasury bills.
Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices, and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
Subordinated loan notes note 27 comprise Tier 2 loan notes issued during the year.
The fair value of the loan notes at 31 December 2015 was 20,099,000 and the carrying value was 19,492,000.
Fair value of the loan notes is based on discounted future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 151 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 33 Capital management Rathbone Brothers Plcs capital is defined for accounting purposes as total equity.
On 3 August 2015, Rathbone Investment Management issued 20,000,000 of subordinated Tier 2 loan notes, following changes to the capital adequacy rules which increased the extent to which the group could effectively use debt to support its regulatory capital balances note 27.
At 31 December 2015, the carrying value of the notes was 19,492,000 2014: nil.
From time-to-time, the group runs small overnight overdraft balances as part of working capital.
The groups objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the groups ability to continue as agoing concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: maintain astrong capital base in acost-efficient manner to be able to support the development of the business when required: optimise the distribution of capital across group companies, reflecting the requirements of each business: strive to make capital freely transferable across the group where possible: and comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Rathbones is classified for capital purposes as abanking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is presented to the PRA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with published rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the PRAs Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 methodology.
The group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar 1 credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both group and entity level.
At 31 December 2015 the groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2015, were 144,468,000 2014: 111,738,000.
The increase in reserves during 2015 primarily from retained earnings, with the additional resources raised from the issue of Tier 2 subordinated loan notes, was partially offset by the increase in intangible assets during the year.
In addition to avariety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecast on amonthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
No breaches were reported to the PRA during the financial years ended 31 December 2014 and 2015.
152 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2015 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 34 Contingent liabilities and commitments a C apital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2015 but not provided in the financial statements amounted to 534,000 2014: 122,000. b The contractual amounts of the groups commitments to extend credit to its clients at 31 December 2015 were as follows: 2015 2014 000 000 Guarantees 578 Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less 20,417 14,634 20,417 15,212 The fair value of the guarantees is nil 2014: nil.
c The group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
The companys agreement to lease space at 1 Curzon Street, London, under which total payments over the lease term at 31 December 2015 were 24,733,000, provides for an upward only rent review in 2018.

The lease provides for rent reviews every five years.
d The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years.
The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the groups control as they result from other industry failures.
T here is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures.
The group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises.
A s detailed in note 1.3, the group has adopted IFRIC 21 Levies in the current year.
Comparative figures have been restated for the impact of this.
Levies of 630,000 have been included within administrative expenses in 2015 2014 restated: 1,439,000.
It is only possible for the group to estimate its share of these losses until invoices are received.
In addition to the FSCS levies accrued in the year further levy charges may be incurred in future years, although the ultimate cost remains uncertain.
