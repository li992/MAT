Lower production reflected drought conditions approximately 11.3 Mt.
and the need to manage dust emissions at Cerrejn, as well as reduced demand for our Navajo Coal product.

Coal revenue for FY2015 decreased by US$678 million to US$5.9 billion.
The decrease in revenues was driven by a Completed development projects 20 per cent reduction in the average realised price for hard coking coal to US$105 t, a 21 per cent reduction in the average Cerrejn P40 Project price received for weak coking coal to US$88 t and a 22 per cent In August 2011, we announced a US$437 million BHP Billiton share reduction in the average realised price for thermal coal to US$58 t. investment in the expansion of Cerrejn, known as the P40 Project, which is expected to increase Cerrejns thermal coal production by Underlying EBIT for FY2015 decreased by US$227 million 8 Mtpa to approximately 40 Mtpa 100 per cent basis.
