As noted in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37 the Aerospace Division consists of 19 operations and the Flexonics Division consists of 14operations.
Each of these operations is considered to be a separate CGU.
Goodwill had been allocated to 21 of these individual CGUs 14 in Aerospace and 7 in Flexonics.
The table below highlights the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGUs that are considered significant incomparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Where the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is individually not considered significant, it is aggregated in the table below.
The carrying amount of goodwill of the aggregated Aerospace CGUs is considered significant and the recoverable amounts for these units are based principally on the same key assumptions.

GOODWILL CONTINUED The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The 2015 goodwill impairment review was undertaken on 31 December 2015.
The recoverable amounts of each individual CGU are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to business performance over the next five years, long-term growth rates beyond 2020 and the discount rates applied.
The key judgements for each individual CGU are the level of revenue and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted into cash flow in each year.
The forecast compound annual growth rate in revenue to 2020 for significant CGUs excluding those businesses that have been recently acquired, is in the range from 0% to 8%.
Forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets and visions per individual unit, as approved by management for the next three years and supplemented by forecasts of performance for a further two years.
These estimates, where appropriate, take account of the current economic environment as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37.
Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated long term growth rates.
For CGUs in the Aerospace segment, cash flows extrapolated beyond 2020 are based on growth rates of 3.0% per annum which do not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier.
For CGUs in the Flexonics segment, cash flows extrapolated beyond 2020 are based on geographical long term forecast GDP growth of around 2.0% per annum, except for Malaysia and India where 5.0% and 7.7% per annum have been respectively assumed.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU and discounted to present value using the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 9.7% 2014 10.1% which is the measurement used by management in assessing investment appraisals.
Sensitivities of possible change have also been considered for each CGU in relation to the value in use calculations: the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced to 1% point and the discount rate was increased by 1% point.
In the case of the Thermal CGU, its recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value by 9.5m.
However, whilst the business has been trading in line with the expectation set out in the Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014, the Directors acknowledge that a reasonable possible change inthe current assumptions of a further 24% reduction in the risk adjusted cash flow projections would result in the recoverable amount of this CGU reducing to a level comparable with its carrying value.
Factors that could lead to lower cash flows than currently estimated over the initial five-year period include: not meeting customers expectations for quality and on-time delivery performance which would result in additional rework and inspection costs to be incurred: not securing sufficient new business with existing customers: and not introducing sufficient new growth customers.
In the case of the LPE and Senior Flexonics Upeca CGUs, their respective recoverable amounts exceeded their carrying values by 15.9m and 16.0m.
However, during the year and in particular in the second half of 2015, lower activity levels than previously anticipated have been experienced in the Industrial Process Control market due to the down-trend in oil and commodity prices.
While this has adversely affected trading levels for LPE and Senior Flexonics Upeca in 2015, their mid-term expectations over the initial five-year period indicate a reversal to the current cyclical slow-down for their markets and prospects.
The Directors acknowledge that a reasonable possible change in the current assumptions of a further 27% and 32% reduction in their respective risk adjusted cash flow projections would result in the recoverable amounts of these CGUs to reduce to a level comparable with their carrying values.
The Directors believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of all other significant CGUs shown in the table above to exceed their recoverable amount.
An impairment loss of 18.8m has been recognised in relation to the full carrying value of goodwill allocated to the GA CGU, the Groups high precision machined component operation based in Wisconsin, USA.
As noted in the Annual Report & Accounts 2014, visibility of off-highway land vehicles for use in agricultural markets and mining operations was less clear as the slowing GDP growth rate in China impacted commodity prices.
During 2015 this has led to lower activity levels than had previously been anticipated at GA which intensified in the second half of the year and significantly reduced visibility of a possible reversal to the current cyclical down trend.
Hence, the value in use assessment indicated that, as at 31 December 2015, the GA CGU no longer had sufficient headroom over its carrying value of goodwill.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
There are no other credit or impairment losses for other classes of financial assets.
Further disclosures on credit risk are included in Note 20.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 58 days 2014 60 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 1.4m 2014 1.4m.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the creditquality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end ofthe year, 8.7m 2014 6.0m is due from the Groups largest customer and 15.2m 2014 15.5m is due from the Groups second largest customer.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision risk in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
Year ended Year ended 2015 2014 m m Movements in allowance for doubtful receivables: At 1 January 1.4 1.0 Provision for impairment 0.3 0.6 Amounts written off as uncollectible 0.2 Amounts recovered 0.1 0.2 At 31 December 1.4 1.4 Ageing analysis of past due but not impaired trade receivables: Up to 30 days past due 17.7 15.6 31 to 60 days past due 4.4 1.7 61 to 90 days past due 0.9 1.3 91 to 180 days past due 1.2 0.5 Total past due but not impaired 24.2 19.1 Not past due 103.0 104.3 Total current trade receivables 127.2 123.4 Less: Reclassified as held for sale 0.6 Total 126.6 123.4 There are no items past due in any other class of financial assets except for trade receivables.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

The Group also has three revolving credit facilities.
A committed 60m five-year syndicated multi-currency facility was entered into in November 2014, which amended and restated a facility of the same amount which was entered into during 2011.
As at 31 December 2015, 3m was drawn under the facility.
At 31 December 2014, 8m was drawn under this facility.
A committed $40m single bank 27.2m loans and letter of credit facility was amended in April 2015 and matures in June 2017.
This facility was increased from $25m to $40m in April 2015.
There were $23.8m 16.2m loans drawn under the facility on 31 December 2015 and $8.2m 5.3m loans drawn on 31 December 2014 and there were letters of outstanding credit of $4.7m 3.2m 2014 6.6m.
A committed 20m two year syndicated sterling facility was entered into in March 2015.
As at 31 December 2015, 20m was drawn under thisfacility.
The Group also has two term loans which were taken out in March 2015, a 20m one year term loan and a 5m one year term loan.
Both these term loans have an option to extend the maturity of the loans to March 2017.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had available 64.8m 2014 56.2m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the balance between debt and equity.
In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its level as compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group also monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as the total of bank and other loans, obligations under finance leases, forward exchange contract losses less cash and cash equivalents and forward exchange contract gains.
Total capital is the equity shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All of the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
Internally the Group aims for this ratio to be between 0.5x and 1.5x.
At 31 December 2015 net debt was 1.4x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2014 0.8x.
In addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover the number of times net interest is covered by the Groups EBITDA to be in excess of 3.5x.
At 31 December 2015 EBITDA was 16.7x the level of net interest 31 December 2014 16.2x.
Therefore, the Group currently has considerable funding headroom.
The Groups strategy in respect of gearing is to target a long-term gearing ratio within the range of 50% to 70%.
Ratios outside this range may still be considered to be acceptable, in certain circumstances.
The gearing ratio for the Group at the end of 2015 was 45% 2014 26%.
The increase in 2015 is attributable mainly to the acquisitions in the period.
The cash generated by the Group in recent years has led to the gearing ratio being lower than the targeted range.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policiesapproved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign exchange risk management The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations trading activities in foreign currencies.
Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has beendetermined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, withall other variables held constant such as interest rates.
The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Groups TreasuryCommittee.
96 Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 20.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Translation risk The Group derived 84% of its revenue from businesses outside the United Kingdom, with 63% relating to operations in North America.
Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and other currencies in relation to Pound Sterling have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the results of the Groups operations when reported in Pound Sterling.
The Group decided not to hedge this translation risk.
In addition, the majority of assets are denominated in foreign currency, particularly in US dollars.
In order to provide a hedge against volatility in the value of these assets compared to the Groups earnings, and hence provide a natural hedge against the Groups principal lending covenant the ratio of net debt toEBITDA, the Group aims to borrow in foreign currencies in similar proportions to its generation of foreign currency EBITDA, where practical and economic.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of all other currencies against Pound Sterling would have increased or decreased 2015 Group operating profit by 9.5m 7.1m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement and would have increased or decreased net equity by34.6m 20.7m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement.
Transaction risk The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the Euro and the South African Rand, and between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling.
The Group seeks to hedge transaction-related exposures mainly on a rolling 15- to 18-month forward basis, but in some cases for periods of up to 60 months and applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship.
Based on the net of the annual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to Group profit after hedging in existence at 31 December 2015 are immaterial.
The impact on net equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the Rand and of the US dollar against Pound Sterling would have decreased or increased net equity by 0.4m and 1.5m, respectively.
Interest rate risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long term in fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
Occasionally a portion of fixed debt interest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
As at year end 2015 the percentage of debt at fixed interest was 68% 2014 75%.
The following sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the beginning of the financial year, and held constant throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant such as foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity assumptions are based on analysis reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee.
If variable interest rates had been 0.5% lower or higher, the Groups net profit would have increased or decreased by 0.2m.
Any fixed interest debt is held to maturity and not fair value adjusted through the profit and loss.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the US dollar market interest rate for the fixed rate debt held up to maturity would have decreased or increased the fair value of the Groups borrowings by 3.3m.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has remained broadly consistent with prior period due to the high proportion of fixed debt.
Credit risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The credit quality of customers is assessed taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Further details on determining the recoverability of trade receivables is provided in Note 18.
The Group is guarantor under the lease of one building in the UK, which arose on the disposal of a former Group-owned subsidiary in 2001. Credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met.
The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group, as part of a process to satisfy the Groups long-term strategic funding requirements.
As noted in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 25, the Group is currently in a well-funded position, with significant headroom under its committed borrowing facilities.
It is considered unlikely that the Group will face any significant funding issues in the foreseeable future.

TAX BALANCE SHEET Current tax The current tax receivable of 5.1m 2014 0.6m includes excess tax paid to tax authorities that is expected to be recovered within 12 months byway of offset against future tax liabilities or refund as well as research and development tax credits receivable.
The majority of the Groups taxable profits arise in countries, including the US, where the estimated tax liabilities are paid in on account instalments during the year to which they relate and are largely paid at the balance sheet date.
The current tax liability of 20.5m 2014 13.3m represents 2.8m 2014 0.5m tax due on profits of the current and prior years as well as 17.7m 2014 16.4m provisions for tax uncertainties that could by their nature fall due within twelve months.
The current tax liability for the prior year also included a receivable of 3.6m relating to overpayments in the US.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of tax for items which are considered to have a range of possible tax outcomes.
These uncertainties exist due to a number of factors including differing interpretations of local tax laws, uncertainties arising from the OECDs BEPS project actions and the determination of appropriate arms length pricing in accordance with OECD transfer pricing principles on internal transactions and financing arrangements.
The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the carrying amounts relate to the estimated tax which could be payable as a result of differing interpretations and decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
Provisions at the balance sheet date are held in respect of multiple years.
Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period: Accelerated Unrealised Goodwill and Retirement Other tax FX intangible benefit temporary Tax depreciation gains amortisation obligations differences losses Total m m m m m m m At 1 January 2014 20.0 0.8 15.0 5.9 15.3 5.1 9.5 Charge credit to income 1.7 0.4 2.7 0.1 1.8 2.7 5.2 Charge credit to other comprehensive income 0.4 0.8 1.2 Charge credit directly to equity 1.1 0.3 0.8 Amounts arising on acquistions 0.5 0.9 1.4 Exchange differences 0.9 1.0 0.6 0.1 1.4 At 1 January 2015 19.7 0.8 19.6 5.0 13.0 3.8 18.3 Credit charge to income 1.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 1.3 3.2 4.8 Charge credit to other comprehensive income 0.4 0.4 1.2 1.2 Charge credit directly to equity 0.9 0.3 0.6 Amounts arising on acquistions 1.7 17.1 1.2 1.4 16.2 Effect of change in tax rates 0.2 0.2 Exchange differences 0.9 0.3 1.2 0.1 0.4 1.3 As at 31 December 2015 21.0 0.6 38.5 4.0 12.4 3.5 40.2 Other temporary differences include balances arising from temporary differences in relation to provisions, accruals, deferred compensation and share-based payments.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: Year ended Year ended 2015 2014 Deferred tax liabilities 46.9 24.8 Deferred tax assets 6.7 6.5 40.2 18.3 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 18.1m 2014 18.4m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 11.6m 2014 15.7m of such losses.
The deferred tax asset includes 2.3m of previously unrecognised tax losses in The Netherlands and 1.4m of tax losses recognised on the acquisition of Steico Industries Inc. Due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining tax losses 6.5m 2014 2.7m, that may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 18.6m 2014 15.9m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of this difference because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
In addition, at the balance sheet date the Group has deductible temporary differences in respect of share-based payments of 0.2m 2014 1.0m for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these differences due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has 5.0m 2014 5.0m of surplus ACT previously written off, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is unlikely to be recovered in the foreseeable future due to the UK earnings profile.
The Group also has 16.1m 2014 15.9m of unused capital losses, as reduced by gains rolled over, available to offset future capital gains for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as no such capital gains are anticipated to arise in the foreseeable future.

The most significant lease, representing approximately 26% 2014 23% of the Groups obligations, expires in 2020.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, the average effective borrowing rate was 3.8% 2014 3.7%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
An analysis of the present value of lease obligations by currency is as follows: Sterling 1.4m 2014 nil, US dollars 0.2m 2014 0.2m and Others 0.2m 2014 0.5m.

ACQUISITIONS Lymington Precision Engineering LPE Limited On 31 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Lymington Precision Engineering LPE Limited, and its 100%-owned subsidiary Lymington Precision Engineers Co. Limited collectively LPE through a business combination.
LPE is based in Lymington, Hampshire, UK and manufactures precision-machined components, fabrications, assemblies and kit sets for the oil and gas, telecommunications, aerospace, defence, land and sea systems, nuclear and marine industries.
LPE strengthens the Groups precision machining capabilities and provides access toLPEs strong customer relationships and adjacent markets.
The consideration was 44.6m comprising a net consideration of 45.8m after taking account of 2.7m of net debt in the business at acquisition date and a payment of 1.5m for working capital.
The acquisition was funded using the Groups existing borrowing facilities, a new two-year 20.0m revolving credit facility and new one-year term loans totalling 25.0m.

None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate mainly to customer contracts and relationships, the fair value of which is dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are being amortised over five years.
Fair value has also been assigned to the order book and trade name which are both being amortised over five years.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a provisional fair value of 5.8m and a gross contractual value of 5.8m, all of which iscurrently expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.9m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The fair value of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is provisional pending finalisation of the fair value exercise.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2015, LPE contributed 16.9m of external revenue and 0.8m to the Groups operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets from the acquisition of 4.2m.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2015, Group revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have been 862.9m, Group adjusted operating profit would have been 109.8m and Group operating profit would have been 72.9m.

Steico brings new and adjacent capabilities to the Group and enables Seniors Aerospace Fluid Systems Division to offer the full range of tube and duct assemblies covering a wider scope of aerospace fluid systems.
The consideration was 50.2m, after taking account of 0.1m working capital adjustment, for the issued share capital and 10.1m for the trading facility.
There is no contingent consideration related to the acquisition.
The acquisition was funded using the Groups existing borrowing facilities and $80.0m private placements.
Set out below is a provisional summary of the net assets acquired: Recognised amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed m Identifiable intangible assets 28.4 Property, plant and equipment 15.4 Inventories 5.5 Financial assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents 2.4 Cash and cash equivalents Financial liabilities 2.1 Net deferred tax liability 10.5 Net assets acquired 39.1 Goodwill 21.2 Total consideration 60.3 Consideration satisfied by: Cash paid 60.3 Total consideration 60.3 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 60.3 Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired Net cash outflow arising on acquisition 60.3 The goodwill of 21.2m represents the premium paid in anticipation of future profitability from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised such as the assembled workforce as well as the expectation that the Group will be able to leverage its wider market access and strong financial position to generate sustainable financial growth beyond what Steico would have potentially achieved as a stand-alone company.
Fair value has also been assigned to the order backlog, long-term customer contracts, Steicos tradename and non-compete agreements, all of which are being amortised over fiveyears.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a provisional fair value of 2.1m and a gross contractual value of 2.1m, all of which iscurrently expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.3m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement forthe 12 months ended 31 December 2015.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2015, Steico contributed 0.9m of external revenue and nil to the Groups operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets from the acquisition of 0.2m.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2015, Group revenue for the 12months ended 31 December 2015 would have been 871.7m, Group adjusted operating profit would have been 109.2m and Group operating profit would have been 68.4m.

a 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan Equity-Settled Long Term Incentive Plans On 2 April 2015 816,646 shares were awarded under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
In addition, a further 241,576 shares were awarded on 1May 2015.
Awards under this plan have a three-year vesting period, subject to earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance conditions being met.
Half the awards have an attaching performance target for EPS growth over the three-year performance periodof at least 4% per annum above RPI.
The other half of the awards begin to vest if the Groups TSR falls in the top half of a comparator groupat the end of the three-year performance period.
Vesting levels increase with higher performance.
The awards are settled by delivering shares to the participants.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with EPS conditions is 327.4p, which is the share price at the date of grant.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with TSR conditions is 154.1p per share reflecting an adjustment of 53% to the fair value ofthe awards with EPS conditions due to the stringent TSR condition.
These fair values were calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
This model incorporates a technique called bootstrapping, which models the impact of the TSR condition.
The model inputs at the date of grant were the share price of 327.4p, expected volatility of 25% per annum, and the performance conditions as noted above.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK, North America and Europe.
These include both defined contribution arrangements and defined benefit arrangements.
The largest defined benefit arrangement for the Group and Company, the Senior plc Pension Plan, is a funded scheme in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable emoluments for the employees of the Group and Company.
This plan was closed to future accrual at the end of 6 April 2014.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2013 and, for the purposes of accounting under IAS19, this valuation has been rolled forward to 31 December 2015.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit plans in the USA, one of which was closed to future accrual from October 2009.
The second plan was closed to future participants from September 2013, and the Executive section was also closed to future accruals from December 2013.
Separate disclosure is made for the funded UK and US defined benefit arrangements.
In both the UK and the USA the assets of funded plans are held in separate trustee administered funds managed by independent financial institutions and have pension costs assessed by consulting actuaries using the Projected Unit Method.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has a small number of unfunded post-retirement plans, including a closed healthcare scheme in the US.
Separate disclosure is provided for these arrangements.
The bulk of the pension obligations relate to the UK Plan and we provide more detail on that arrangement below.
For the Senior plc Pension Plan in the UK, the Trustee is Senior Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
There is a policy that at least one-third of all Directors should be nominated by members of the plan.
Currently there are two member-nominated Directors and four Directors who have been nominated by the Company, of which the Chairman and one other Director are viewed as independent.
The investment strategy for the plan is decided locally by the Trustees.
The primary investment objective is for the plan to be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due.
This objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a horizonbased approach.
Under this approach, all benefit cash flows expected to fall in the next 17 years the horizon period are met by investment in low-risk assets such as fixed interest and index-linked bonds.
Cash flows after the horizon period are met by investment in more volatile assets which are expected to deliver a higher return than bonds in the longer term.
Benefits are expected to be paid over the next 60 to 70 years.
The UK Plans average duration is around 17 years.
In setting this strategy, the Trustees consider a wide range of asset classes, the risk and rewards of a number of possible asset allocation options, the sustainability of each asset class within each strategy, and the need for appropriate diversification between different asset classes.
The Trustees continue to review their investment strategy and have also implemented a switching mechanism to secure any outperformances of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
The Group is ultimately responsible for making up any shortfall in the UK defined benefit Plan over a period agreed with the trustees.
To the extent that actual experience is different to that assumed the funding position will be better or worse than anticipated.
As such, the contributions required by the Group could vary in the future.
The two key risks faced by pension schemes are longevity i. e. members living longer than expected and investment risk i. e. the schemes assets perform poorly relative to the liabilities.
The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the UK plan to fund the plan deficit over an eight-year period from April 2013 to March 2021.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid during 2016 to the UK plan is 8.7m 8.1m of which is to fund the past service deficit and 0.6m in respect of administrative expenses and to the US funded plans is nil.
Contributions payable to the Plan do not affect the measurement of the defined benefit liability or asset recognised on the Company balance sheet on the grounds that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund, assuming the gradual settlement of Plan liabilities over time until all members have left.
In considering this the Company has taken into account that the trustees do not have unilateral powers to wind up the Plan or modify benefits.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC14 are currently being considered.
At this stage, the Company believes that the above accounting treatment will not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC14.

This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Plan.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED h Other post-retirement liabilities This balance comprises an unfunded German pension plan 3.0m 2014 3.3m, unfunded closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the USA 0.4m 2014 0.4m and provision for post-retirement payments in France of 2.1m 2014 2.0m.
The closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the US have been valued on a Projected Unit Method using a discount rate of 4.1%.
Asat 31 December 2015 no more participants were eligible for medical benefits under the plan.
The German plan has been subject to formal actuarial valuation on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 2.1%, salary growth 0.0% and inflation 1.75%.
InFrance, the provision arises from a legal obligation to make payments to retirees in the first two years post-retirement.
Hence, it is not subject todiscounting to the same extent as the other longer-term post-retirement liabilities.
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE On 21 December 2015, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of its Senior Aerospace Composites business which is based in Wichita, Kansas, USA and is included in the Aerospace Division.
The sale, which was completed on 16 February 2016, enables management to place greater focus on opportunities in its core activities in the Aerospace and Flexonics Divisions.
This business has been classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet.
An impairment loss of 1.8m has been recognised after taking into account the proceeds from the disposal and associated exit costs.
The previously recorded foreign exchange differences on translation will be recycled to the income statement on the date of disposal.
The major categories of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are as follows: Year ended 2015 m Property, plant and equipment 0.6 Inventories 0.6 Trade and other receivables 0.6 Total assets classified as held for sale 1.8 Trade and other payables 1.1 Total liabilities classified as held for sale 1.1 Net assets classified as held for sale 0.7 37.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions or claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which could be for substantial amounts.
In May 2015 Senior Aerospace Ketema was named as co-defendant in a class action lawsuit filed against Ametek, Inc. in the US.
The lawsuit claims that Ametek had polluted the groundwater during its tenure as owners of the site where Senior Aerospace Ketema is currently located.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, based on the information currently held by the Directors, the Directors do not believe any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, are likely to result in significant loss to the Group.
