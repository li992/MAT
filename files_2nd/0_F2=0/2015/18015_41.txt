The deferred tax balance has been adjusted to reflect this change.
The Group has tax losses and other temporary differences of 160.0m 2014: 117.4m that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses or other temporary differences arose: of which 128.8m are related to losses incurred by companies acquired by the Group and therefore not as a result of the Groups trading performance.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of 160.0m 2014: 117.4m of these losses or other temporary differences, as their recoverability is uncertain.
Dividends received from subsidiaries on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate.
The gross temporary differences of those subsidiaries affected by such potential taxes is 27m 2014: 21m.
No deferred income tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group files income tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world.
Various tax authorities are currently examining the Groups income tax returns.
Tax returns contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete.
While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, the Group does not anticipate that there will be any material impact on the Groups financial position or results of operations.
In addition, the Group is directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulation worldwide.
Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
This includes potential changes arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.
