Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes Dened contribution Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Dened benefit The cost of providing benets is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in whichthose benets are earned by the employees.
Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs resulting from a plan amendment orcurtailment arerecognised immediately in the income statement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Groups balance sheet represents the present value of the dened benefit obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 142 reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
The bid values of schemeassets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The presentvalues of scheme liabilities are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Certain of the Groups equity accounted investments participate in the Groups dened benefit schemes as well as Airbus SAS Airbus, theGroups share of which was disposed of in 2006.
As these schemes are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated a share of the IAS19 pension deficit to its equity accounted investments and other participating employers.
In December 2015, BAE Systems, Airbus and the scheme trustees agreed to work towards the creation of a separate Airbus section of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme Main Scheme in 2016 with the allocation of the deficit to the BAE Systems and Airbus sections based on eachmembers last employer.
This allocation methodology is considered to represent a better estimate of the deficit allocation than the relative payroll contributions of active members and has been reected in the allocation of the IAS 19 pension deficit in the Main Scheme at31 December 2015.
The impact of this change on the amounts allocated at 31 December 2015 is anincrease of 187m 153m post-tax in the Groups share of the reported IAS 19 deficit.
Currently, in the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to full its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.
However, following the creation of an Airbus section of the Main Scheme, the Groups obligation in respect of Airbus is expected to be removed.
With the exception of the allocation of the Main Scheme deficit to Airbus, the deficit allocation method for other employers of the Main Scheme and for all other schemes is based on the relative payroll contributions of active members, which is consistent with prior years and isintended to reect a reasonable approximation of the share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
Pension schemes Background BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal schemes in the UK and US are funded dened benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Thetwo largest funded dened benefit schemes are the Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which, inaggregate, represent 71% 2014 71% of thetotal IAS 19 dened benefit obligation at 31December 2015.
The schemes in other countries are primarily dened contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2015, the weighted average durations of the UK and US dened benefit pension obligations were 18 years 2014 19years and 12years 2014 12 years, respectively.
The split of the dened benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main Scheme, 2000 Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below: Active Deferred Pensioner % % % 1 Main Scheme 32 19 49 2 2000 Plan 14 29 57 3 US schemes 34 18 48 1.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Regulatory framework The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specic-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including thepayment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004.
These schemes were established under trust and the responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualied pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension benefit Guarantee Corporation PBGC up to certain limits.
These schemes were established under and are governed by the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named duciary with the authority to manage their operation.
Benets The UK dened benefit schemes provide benets to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members final salaries.
The benets attract ination-related increases both in deferment and payment.
All UK dened benefit schemes are closed to new entrants, with benets for new employees being provided through a dened contribution scheme.
The Normal Retirement Age for active members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65.
Specic benets applicable to members differ between schemes.
Further details on the benets provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: baesystemspensions.
The US dened benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013.
The benets accrued based on the final salaries ofmembers atthat point will become payable on retirement.
The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65.
Funding The majority of the UK and US dened benefit pension schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries, equity accounted investments and other participating employers.
The individual pension schemes funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement frameworks set out in their funding policies.
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value, whilst the liabilities are determined based on prudent assumptions set by the trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries.
The separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes include assumptions which differ from the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes shown on page 142.
The latest valuations of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan were performed as at 31March 2014 and showed a funding deficit of 2.6bn.
The total net funding deficit in respect of all of the UK schemes was 2.7bn.
deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes run until 2026.
The results of future triennial valuations and associated funding requirements will be impacted by the future performance of investment markets, and interest and ination rates.
The total Group contributions made to the dened benefit schemes in the year ended 31 December 2015 were 438m 2014 548m excluding those amounts allocated to equity accounted investments and participating employers of 98m 2014 92m.
This includes additional contributions of 33m into the UK schemes relating to the share buyback programme 2014 108m.
In 2016, the Group expects to make contributions at a similar level to the recurring contributions and deficit funding as made in 2015.
The Group incurred a charge of 140m 2014 125m in relation to dened contribution schemes for employees.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Risk management The dened benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market investment risk, interest rate risk, ination risk and longevity risk.
Risk Mitigation Market investment risk Asset returns may not move in line with the The investment portfolios are highly diversied, investing in a wide range of assets, in order to liabilities and may be subject to volatility.
provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a materially adverse impact on the total portfolio.
To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching portfolio, which largely consists of index-linked bonds, gilts and swaps, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities.
Some 48% 2014 46% of the Groups pension scheme assets are held in equities and pooled investment vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term.
Some of the Groups pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of their investment strategy to manage the level of market risk.
In August 2013, the Main Scheme implemented a long-dated equity option strategy protecting 1.4bn of assets against a significant fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal UK schemes rates, with lower interest rates leading to an invest in interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest rates.
The swaps increase in the valuation of liabilities.
are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
Ination risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in ination, In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal with higher ination leading to anincrease in UKschemes invest in long-term ination swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in thevaluation of liabilities.
The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
Effective 1 May 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to allow retired members to elect for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain rights tofuture pension increases.
Longevity risk Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with Longevity Adjustment Factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in increases in life expectancies leading to an ordertoadjust the pension benets payable so as to share the cost of people living longer increase in the valuation of liabilities.
In February 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan entered into an arrangement with Legal & General to insure against longevity risk for the current pensioner population, covering 2.7bn of pension scheme liabilities.
In December 2013, similar arrangements were entered into, with Legal & General, by the trustees of the Royal Ordnance Pension Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme, covering 0.9bn and 0.8bn of pension scheme liabilities, respectively.
These arrangements reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.

Ination In the UK, the ination assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and xed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
In the US, ination assumptions are not significant asthe Groups US pension schemes are not indexed with ination.
Rate of increase in salaries The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be Retail Prices Index RPI ination of 3.2% 2014 RPI ination of 3.2%, plus a promotional scale.
From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benets.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on Consumer Prices Index CPI ination of 2.3% 2014 CPI ination of 2.3%, with the exception ofthe 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI ination of 3.2% 2014 RPI ination of 3.2%.
For all UK schemes, the rate of increase in deferred pensions is subject to ination caps.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes.
Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on either RPI or CPI ination, and some are subject to an ination cap.
With the exception of two smaller schemes, the rate of increase in pensions in payment is based on RPI ination.
Life expectancy For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of scheme members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2013 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1.25% 2014 1.25%, for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reecting the results of its comprehensive mortality study.
For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2015 are a blend of the fully generational RP-2014 Aggregate table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2015.
The mortality table changes resulted in a small reduction in the USdened benefit obligations.
IRS approval of the mortality tables is expected in 2017, following which the tables are expected to be adopted forfunding valuation purposes.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Retirement benets other than pensions Background The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benetsafter retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benets to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain USsubsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2015.
These valuations were rolled forward to reect the information at 31 December 2015.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for dened benefit pension schemes.
Principal actuarial assumptions The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 4.8% 2014 5.3% based on the assumptions that the increases are 7.3% in2016 reducing to 4.5% by 2024 and 4.5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 8% in 2016 reducing to 4.5% by 2024 and 4.5% eachyear thereafter for post-retirement.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2015 and keeping all other assumptions as set out on page 142.
Financial assumptions Changes in the following financial assumptions would have the following effect on the dened benefit pension obligation before allocation to equity accounted investments and other participating employers: Increase decrease bn Discount rate: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 Ination: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 The sensitivity analysis does not allow for the impact of the Groups risk management activities in respect of interest rate and ination risk see page 141 on the valuation of the assets.
Across all of its pension schemes, the Group is hedged against approximately 35% and 40% of interest rate and ination risk, respectively, measured relative to the funding liabilities.
The Groups US schemes are not indexed with ination.
The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the ination assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point change to expectations of future ination results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all ination-related assumptions rate of increase in salaries, rate of increase in deferred pensions and rate of increase in pensions in payment used to value the liabilities.
However, upper and lower limits exist on the majority of ination-related benets such that a change in expectations of future ination may not have the same impact on the ination-related benets, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities.
Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results beyond the specic sensitivity gures shown may not be appropriate.
To illustrate this, the increase decrease in the dened benefit pension obligation resulting from larger changes in the ination assumption would be as follows: Increase decrease bn Ination: 0.5 percentage point increase 1.6 0.5 percentage point decrease 1.6 1.0 percentage point increase 3.2 1.0 percentage point decrease 3.0 Demographic assumptions Changes in the life expectancy assumption, including the benefit of longevity swap arrangements see longevity risk on page 141, wouldhave the following effect on the total IAS 19 deficit: Increase decrease bn Life expectancy: One-year increase 0.9 One-year decrease 0.9 BAE Systems Annual Report 2015 |
