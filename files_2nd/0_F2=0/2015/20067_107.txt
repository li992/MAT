Additional information 133 Definitions continued Ordinary Shares: the ordinary shares of nominal value 5 pence each in the capital of BT Group plc, including, if the context requires, the Consideration Shares Regulations: the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 of the United Kingdom Resolutions: the Resolutions set out in the Notice of General Meeting Sellers: Deutsche Telekom and Orange Shareholder: a holder of Ordinary Shares and Shareholders shall be construed accordingly Sponsor: J. P. Morgan Cazenove Transaction Documents: the Share Purchase Agreement, the Relationship Agreement, the Standstill and Lock-up Agreement and the CP Contracts SuMMARy OF ThE PRInCIPAL TERMS OF ThE PROPOSED ACquISITIOn OF EE By BT GROuP PLC Part A Share Purchase Agreement On 5 February 2015, the Share Purchase Agreement was entered into between BT Group plc, the Sellers, who hold 100% of the issued share capital of EE on a combined basis, Deutsche Telekom AG as guarantor of Deutsche Telekom and Orange SA as guarantor of Orange.
Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have conditionally agreed to sell, and BT Group plc has conditionally agreed to acquire, the entire issued share capital of EE.
Purchase price 1.1 Consideration adjustments Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, BT Group plc will purchase the entire issued share capital of EE for a purchase price equivalent to 12.5bn on a debt and cash free basis.
The purchase price to be paid is subject to customary post-Completion adjustments to reflect the debt, cash, working capital and capex position of EE at Completion.
Based upon EEs net debt as at 31 December 2014, adjusted for estimated other debt-like items, the consideration payable by BT Group plc will be satisfied by: a the issue to Deutsche Telekom of around 1.2bn new Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 12% of BT Group plcs share capital on an enlarged basis post-Acquisition: b a residual cash payment to Deutsche Telekom of around 200m based upon a reference price of 411.5 pence per Ordinary Share, being the closing price on 4 December 2014 subject to further variation in accordance with the cap and collar protection mechanism described below : c the issue to Orange of around 0.4bn new Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 4% of BT Group plcs share capital on an enlarged basis postAcquisition: and d a residual cash payment to Orange of around 3.4bn based upon a reference price of 411.5 pence per Ordinary Share subject to further variation in accordance with the cap and collar protection mechanism described below.
The Consideration Shares will be issued at Completion, credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends, distributions or any return of capital declared, made or paid after Completion.
1.2 Cap and collar mechanism The Share Purchase Agreement contains a cap and collar protection mechanism which provides for an adjustment to the cash element of the consideration where there is a movement in the price of an Ordinary Share measured by reference to the average Ordinary Share price in the 15 trading days before the date which is five Business Days before Completion from the reference price set out above, subject to: a a minimum share price per Ordinary Share of approximately 395.0 pence being 4% below the reference price.
A share price below this level would not result in further adjustment to the cash consideration and therefore the value of the Acquisition would fall below 12.5bn: and b a maximum share price per Ordinary Share of approximately 428.0 pence being 4% above the reference price.
A share price above this level would not result in further adjustment to the cash consideration and therefore the value of the Acquisition would increase above 12.5bn.
If the cash element of the consideration due to Deutsche Telekom is estimated to be less than zero at Completion as a result of EEs estimated adjusted net debt position as at Completion, BT Group plc can reduce the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued to Deutsche Telekom by such number as results in the cash consideration payable to Deutsche Telekom then being as near as possible to zero.
In such circumstances, Deutsche Telekom would then receive less than 12% of BT Group plcs enlarged issued share capital as a result of the Acquisition.
Conditions Completion is conditional upon satisfaction or, where capable of being waived, waiver of the following Conditions prior to the Long Stop Date or such later date as the parties may agree : a passing the Acquisition Resolution: b allotment of the Consideration Shares to the Sellers, subject only to their admission to listing and trading: c the UK Listing Authority having approved the admission of the Consideration Shares to the Official List and the London Stock Exchange having approved admission of the Consideration Shares to trading with effect from Completion: 10 802639 Additional Information p128-142.
