b Basis of consolidation Financial Statements.
The consolidation of the subsidiaries acquired in advance of the Initial Public Offering in March 2010 C-Retail Limited, DKH Retail Limited, SuperGroup Concessions Limited, SuperGroup International Limited, SuperGroup Internet Limited and SuperGroup Retail Ireland Limited into the financial statements of SuperGroup Plc has been prepared under the principles of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
This accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between consideration and fair value of the underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve.
All subsequent business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting note 1c.
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in associate is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit or loss of investment in the statement of comprehensive income.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.

non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
d Foreign currencies The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.

i Leasing and similar commitments Leases are accounted for as operating leases as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and the rental charges are charged to the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent-free periods and are considered financing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, as they are the same as financing from landlords to fund store fit-outs.
Cash contributions Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a deferred income liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and credited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent-free periods A deferred income liability is built up on the balance sheet during the rent-free period, which is then credited to the Group statement of comprehensive income over the life of the lease.

Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
k Impairment The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.

Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss, and the amortisation is recorded as finance income cost using the effective interest yield method on the asset liability.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
a Acquisition accounting In accounting for business combinations, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired have to be measured at their fair values.
In particular, some judgement is required in estimating the fair value of inventory with reference to current selling prices and costs to sell, and judgement in estimating the valuation of intangible assets and pre-existing relationships with reference to forecast future sales under the pre-existing contract.
Details concerning acquisitions and business combinations are outlined in note 33. b Exceptional items Judgements are required as to whether items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional.

The Group has defined its CGUs as Retail and Wholesale.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, the goodwill on the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA: SMAC SMAC A S, SMAC Norge A S and SMAC Retail A S : and German business combination was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
Following a change in the Groups management and financial reporting structure, the Group changed its method of allocation of goodwill, and goodwill of 20.0m was allocated between the Groups CGUs, Retail and Wholesale, based on the last 3 years actual sales achieved by each CGU.
This led to an allocation of 15m and 5m of goodwill to the retail and wholesale CGUs respectively.
The recoverable amounts in 2015 were measured based on post tax value in use 2014: based on post tax value in use.
This methodology is considered reasonable given the significant levels of headroom noted from this assessment.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.

Key assumptions Financial In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with Our Our Gover Governance.

Discount rates Financial Discount rates are derived from the Groups post tax weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.
The pre-tax weighted cost of Statements.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years, a long-term average growth rate of 2% has been used: this is not greater than the average longterm retail growth rate for each CGU.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The present values of the future cashflows of the Retail and Wholesale CGUs are significant and are insensitive to any changes to potential changes to key assumptions.

Financial risk management The Company and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances which each entity is responsible for managing.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Group mitigates risk on in certain markets or customers considered higher risk with payments in advance, accelerated and bank guarantees, as well as adopting credit insurance where appropriate.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major credit cards or by PayPal.

Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital employed.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital employed is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The Group is in a net cash position at 25 April 2015.
The directors have concluded that the Company is best served by retaining current cash reserves to support growth.
Consequentially, a recommendation will be made to the AGM that no dividend is payable for 2015 2014: nil.
The Directors recently announced the intention to commence the payment of ordinary dividends with an interim dividend payment in FY16.
The Directors will also consider one-off returns to shareholders where excess capital has not been deployed.
