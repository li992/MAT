Financial statements | Notes Notes 1 Basis of preparation Bunzl plc the Company is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
i Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been approved by the directors.
They are prepared in accordance with i EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS and ii International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies below.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
ii New accounting standards and interpretations There are no new standards issued by the IASB that are effective for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Group has adopted all relevant amendments to existing standards issued by the IASB that are effective from 1 January 2015 with no material impact on its consolidated results.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that will be effective from 1 January 2016 and beyond.
Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on its consolidated results.
2 Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group is either exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
A list of all of Bunzl plcs subsidiary undertakings is included in the Related undertakings note in the Shareholder information section on pages 141 to 143 and is subject to audit.
The results of all of the subsidiary undertakings are included in full in these consolidated financial statements.
ii Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion and deferred consideration, excluding payments which are contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired.
The excess of the consideration excluding payments contingent on future employment over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Payments that are contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates.
All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such balances, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented in this separate component of equity.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 91 Financial statements | Notes Notes continued 2 Accounting policies continued c Revenue The Group is engaged in the delivery of goods to customers.
Revenue from a sale is recognised in the income statement upon delivery of the relevant goods, which is the point in time at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred.
Revenue is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Revenue is valued at invoiced amounts, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant.
Returns provisions and early settlement discounts are based on experience over an appropriate period whereas volume discounts are based on agreements with customers.
d Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the inventories sold or disposed of in the period, where the cost of inventories is net of supplier rebate income related to those inventories.
e Supplier rebates The Group has various rebate arrangements with a number of suppliers.
Some of these arrangements are based on the volume of products purchased and others are based on the volume of products sold.
Supplier rebate income is recognised in cost of goods sold concurrent with the sale of the inventories to which it relates and is calculated by reference to the expected consideration receivable from each rebate arrangement.
Supplier rebate income is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the amount due.
Supplier rebate income accrued but not yet received is included in other receivables.
f Share based payments The Group operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans.
Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 and the Directors remuneration report.
The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model which is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
g Leases Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings due to the indefinite life of land.
h Income tax Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
92 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements | Notes 2 Accounting policies continued j Depreciation Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 2% or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years Plant and machinery 8%33% Fixtures, fittings and equipment 8%33% Freehold land Not depreciated Assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
k Intangible assets i Goodwill Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations from 1 January 2004 and has elected not to restate previous business combinations.
For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination excluding payments contingent on future employment and other acquisition related costs in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value.
These principally relate to customer relationships and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
l Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
The recoverable amounts of other assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and the value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the income statement.
m Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories comprises the purchase price, net of any related supplier volume rebates, plus import duties and other taxes, inbound freight and haulage costs and other related costs incurred to bring the product into its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale.
n Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these assets are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables or uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to collect all such amounts.
o Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 93 Financial statements | Notes Notes continued 2 Accounting policies continued p Financial instruments Under International Accounting Standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, financial instruments are initially measured at fair value with subsequent measurement depending upon the classification of the instrument.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost unless they are in a fair value hedging relationship.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
i Fair value hedge Where a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a recognised asset or liability, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged with changes recognised in the income statement.
ii Cash flow hedge Where a derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a forecast transaction, any effective portion of the change in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
iii Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective such differences are recognised in the income statement.
q Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts.
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash balances and short term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date the deposit is made.
r Net debt Net debt is defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings and the fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.
s Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the Groups obligations under the contract.
t Investment in own shares The cost of shares held either directly treasury shares or indirectly employee benefit trust shares is deducted from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised in retained earnings.
At each reporting date the Group remeasures the value of the shares held in the employee benefit trust to present them in the own shares reserve at the market value of those shares at the reporting date.
This is done through a reclassification from retained earnings to the own shares reserve.
This movement has no effect on the actual numbers of shares held by the employee benefit trust.
94 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements | Notes 2 Accounting policies continued u Retirement benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes A defined contribution pension scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes A defined benefit pension scheme is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution pension scheme.
Defined benefit pension schemes are recognised on the balance sheet as a defined benefit pension asset or a defined benefit pension liability based on the difference between the fair value of pension scheme assets and the present value of pension scheme liabilities.
The present value of pension scheme liabilities are calculated by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted using the rate applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity and currency to the pension scheme liabilities.
The fair value of any pension scheme assets at bid price are deducted from the present value of pension scheme liabilities to determine the net deficit or surplus of each scheme.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit pension schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses of pension scheme liabilities and the actual return on pension scheme assets excluding amounts already included in net interest.
The net actuarial gain or loss for the year is recorded in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
Current service cost, past service cost or gain and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested.
Net interest on the net defined benefit pension liability or asset is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension scheme deficit or surplus at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset at the beginning of the year.
Net interest is recorded within finance cost in the income statement.
When the valuation of a defined benefit pension scheme results in a surplus, the recognised defined benefit pension asset is limited to the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the pension scheme or reductions in future contributions and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
v Dividends The interim dividend is recognised in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
w Non-GAAP measures Further to the various performance measures defined under IFRS, the Group reports a number of additional performance measures that are designed to assist with the understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and its businesses.
These measures are not defined under IFRS and, as a result, do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice known as non-GAAP measures and may not be directly comparable with other companies non-GAAP measures.
They are not designed to be a substitute for any of the IFRS measures of performance.
The principal additional performance measures used within the consolidated financial statements include: adjusted operating profit: adjusted profit before income tax: adjusted profit for the year: adjusted earnings per share: and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
These measures exclude the charge for intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and, where relevant, the associated tax.
Intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and the associated tax are items which are not taken into account by management when assessing the results of the business as they do not relate to the underlying operating performance.
Accordingly, these items are removed in calculating the profitability measures by which management assess the performance of the Group.
Acquisition related costs comprise transaction costs and expenses, deferred consideration payments relating to the retention of former owners of businesses acquired and adjustments to previously estimated earn outs.
The Groups key performance indicators are set out and defined on pages 14 and 15.
A number of these are based on, or derived from, the non-GAAP measures noted above.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 95 Financial statements | Notes Notes continued 2 Accounting policies continued Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the choice and application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from those derived from the application of such judgements, estimates and assumptions, in particular those which involve anticipating future events.
Accordingly, the judgements, estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with the impact of any revisions considered necessary being recognised prospectively thereafter.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have most risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are noted below and explained more fully in the referenced Notes.
The directors believe that the judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are appropriate.
Where relevant and practicable, sensitivity analysis is disclosed in the relevant Notes to demonstrate the impact of changes in estimates or assumptions used.
a Defined benefit pension schemes The measurement of the present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities involves the use of various actuarial assumptions, the selection of which is judgemental.
The Group uses independent actuarial experts to assist with the measurement of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities but the actual liabilities could be materially different.
The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are described in Note 20.
The judgement made in relation to the application of IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, is also described in Note 20. b Accounting for business combinations Part of the Companys strategy is to grow through acquisitions.
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method as described in the Business combinations accounting policy, Note 2 a ii, and the Goodwill accounting policy, Note 2 k i.
This includes the determination of fair values for assets and liabilities acquired, including the separate identification of intangible assets, which use assumptions and estimates and are therefore subjective.
The Group has developed a process to meet the requirements of IFRS 3, including the separate identification of customer relationship intangible assets based on forecast performance and estimated customer attrition rates.
External valuation specialists are used where appropriate.
The process applied is described in Note 24. c Recoverability of intangible assets As noted above, part of the Companys strategy is to grow through acquisitions which has led to material goodwill and customer relationships intangible assets being recognised on the balance sheet.
Goodwill is tested annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
The allocation of goodwill to cash generating units CGUs is a judgement made by management.
Assumptions are then used to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU, principally based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Actual performance may differ from managements expectations.
The judgements made and assumptions used in performing impairment testing are described in Note 9.
The useful economic lives of customer relationships intangible assets are also reviewed at least annually, with any revisions to the original estimated useful economic lives accounted for prospectively.
d Taxation The Group operates in many countries and is therefore subject to income taxes in a number of different tax jurisdictions.
The amount of tax payable or receivable on profits or losses for the period is subject to the agreement of the tax authority in each respective jurisdiction and the tax liability or asset position is open to review for several years after the accounting period ends.
In determining the provisions for income taxes, management is required to make judgements and estimates based on interpretations of tax statute, case law and prior experience.
The provisions are based on managements best estimate of the tax amounts expected to be paid or received.
The ultimate amounts payable or receivable may differ from the amounts of any provisions recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a result of the estimates and assumptions used.

The Group results are reported as four business areas based on geographic regions, which are reviewed monthly by the Companys chief operating decision maker, the Board of Directors.
The principal results reviewed for each business area are revenue and adjusted operating profit.
Reportable segments are determined based on quantitative thresholds in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The three business areas of North America, Continental Europe and UK & Ireland are operating segments that meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and are therefore disclosed separately above.
The Rest of the World business area contains Latin America and Australasia which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure as reportable segments.
Rest of the World is therefore an other segment that is disclosed above as a reportable segment as this information is considered to be useful to users of the financial statements and it also helps to reconcile the results of the reportable segments to the Groups consolidated and business area results.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 97 Financial statements | Notes Notes continued 3 Segment analysis continued Information related to each reportable segment is set out above.
The revenue presented relates to external customers.
Sales between the business areas are not material.
Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the foodservice, grocery, cleaning & hygiene, retail, safety and healthcare market sectors, but results are not monitored on this basis.
The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to adjusted operating profit and this measure also represents the segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance with IFRS 8.
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas.
There are no customers who account for more than 10% of Group revenue.
Customer dependencies are regularly monitored.
As noted above, the businesses within each operating segment operate in a number of different countries and sell products across a range of market sectors.
The table below provides a breakdown of revenue by market sector.
The other category covers a wide range of market sectors, none of which is sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure.

It is the Companys policy to assess the services required on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the most appropriate adviser is retained.
As a result, it is sometimes appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Companys auditors.
However other firms are also used by the Company to provide non-audit services if such other firms are thought to be best placed to undertake the work involved.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the external auditors perform, including the fees paid for such work, to ensure that the auditors objectivity and independence are not compromised.

Customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
Impairment tests The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs and is tested annually for impairment.
A description of the Groups principal activities is set out in the Chief Executives review.
There is no significant difference in the nature of activities across different geographies.
The identification of CGUs reflects the way in which the business is managed on a geographical basis.
Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs of disposal.
The value in use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted.
The Groups methodology is to use a projection period of five years consisting of detailed cash flow forecasts for the first two years and CGU specific growth assumptions for years three, four and five.
For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate specific to the CGU to derive a terminal value.
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating activities of the CGU and reflect managements expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period.
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, including any significant changes to the customer base, achievability of future profit margins and the discount rates used in the present value calculation.
The information used for valuation purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying cost base.
This provides a long term growth rate which is consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates and managements assessment of future operating performance and market share movements.
The discount rates used are determined with assistance provided by external valuation specialists.
At 31 December 2015 North America, France Hygiene, UK Hospitality and the Netherlands carried a significant amount of goodwill in comparison with the total value of the Groups goodwill.
At 31 December 2015 the carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America was 295.1m 2014: 245.2m, France Hygiene was 72.5m 2014: 76.5m, UK Hospitality was 62.5m 2014: 62.5m and the Netherlands was 62.8m 2014: 65.5m.
At 31 December 2015 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Groups CGUs, excluding North America, France Hygiene, UK Hospitality and the Netherlands, was 506.4m 2014: 472.6m.
The remaining goodwill relates to CGUs which are not individually significant.
For North America, France Hygiene, UK Hospitality and the Netherlands the weighted average long term growth rate used in 2015 was 2.5% 2014: 2.5% reflecting anticipated revenue and profit growth.
A discount rate of 8% 2014: 9% has been applied to the value in use calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date.
Similar assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have considered alternative market risk assumptions to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual countries with long term growth rates ranging from 2.5%6.9% 2014: 2.5%7.2% and discount rates ranging from 8%19% 2014: 9%18%.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 103 Financial statements | Notes Notes continued 9 Intangible assets continued Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long term growth rates.
A key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent relates to revenue growth including the impact of changes to the underlying customer base.
This assumption is sensitive to customer attrition and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established.
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management has concluded that it is reasonable to assume that there will be no material deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact future cash flows and that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Should such a change occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU.
Any such changes are monitored through normal monthly procedures.

The Group monitors the return on average operating capital employed and the return on invested capital as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, the return on average operating capital employed was 55.5% 2014: 57.7%, the return on invested capital was 17.1% 2014: 17.6%, the level of total shareholders equity at 31 December 2015 was 1,016.3m 2014: 983.9m and the amount of dividends paid in the year ended 31 December 2015 was 116.1m 2014: 105.6m.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation which helps fund future development and growth.
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are periodically reviewed by the executive directors and the Board.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: b a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates: or c a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2p.
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety of sources.
Additionally, compliance with the Groups biannual debt covenants is monitored on a monthly basis and formally tested at 30 June and 31 December.
The principal covenant limits are net debt, calculated at average exchange rates, to operating profit before depreciation, intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs EBITDA of no more than 3.5 times and interest cover of no less than 3.0 times.
Sensitivity analyses using various scenarios are applied to forecasts to assess their impact on covenants and net debt.
During 2015 all covenants have been complied with and based on current forecasts it is expected that such covenants will continue to be complied with for the foreseeable future.
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups banks and US private placement notes denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros.
During 2015 the Group agreed an issue of fixed interest rate US private placement notes in respect of which drawings of $225m and 67m were made during the year and the remaining notes of 133m and 97m are due to be drawn in March 2016.
At 31 December 2015 the nominal total of US private placement notes outstanding was 1,001.9m 2014: 793.2m with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2028.
During the year the Group also refinanced or agreed new banking facilities totalling 133.1m.
The Groups committed bank facilities mature between 2016 and 2021.
At 31 December 2015 the available committed bank facilities totalled 969.0m 2014: 917.0m of which 154.9m 2014: 136.5m was drawn down.
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 105 Financial statements | Notes Notes continued 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued The undrawn committed bank facilities available at 31 December were as follows: 2015 2014 m m Expiring within one year 60.0 Expiring after one year but within two years 191.0 90.0 Expiring after two years 563.1 690.5 814.1 780.5 In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
At 31 December 2015 there were no loans secured by fixed charges on property 2014: 0.8m.
The contractual maturity profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out in the tables below.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December in the case of floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
Derivative assets and liabilities have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.
Bank loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.

Level two fair value measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows, translated at the appropriate balance sheet date exchange rates and adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk as applicable.
For financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value, including trade receivables, trade payables, other current payables and non-current payables, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short term nature.
However, within other current payables there is 3.8m 2014: 8.0m related to earn outs on businesses acquired which are recorded at fair value.
This is a level three fair value measurement based on the expected future profitability of the businesses acquired.

In addition, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are used to manage the interest rate risk profile.
At 31 December 2015 fixed rate debt of 679.4m 2014: 635.7m related to fixed rate US private placement notes denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros was stated at amortised cost with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2024.
At 31 December 2015 floating rate debt was comprised of 160.0m floating rate bank loans 2014: 138.5m and 339.5m of fixed rate US private placement notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2028 which have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps 2014: 173.6m.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps reprice every three or six months.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate options.
Borrowings with a notional principal of 154.9m were capped at 31 December 2015 2014: 45.5m.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps since the majority of their value is related to time value.
The strike rates of these options are based on LIBOR repricing every three months.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have affected profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2015 0.4 0.4 2014 1.4 1.4 Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups sales are made and income is earned in US dollars, euros and other foreign currencies.
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on translation of earnings into sterling at average exchange rates.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2015 2014 2015 2014 US dollar 1.53 1.65 1.47 1.56 Euro 1.38 1.24 1.36 1.29 For the year ended 31 December 2015, a movement of one cent in the US dollar and euro average exchange rates would have changed profit before income tax by 1.1m and 0.3m respectively 2014: 0.9m and 0.4m and adjusted profit before income tax by 1.2m and 0.5m respectively 2014: 1.0m and 0.6m.
108 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements | Notes 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are usually relatively limited.
Where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow hedges.
However, the economic impact of foreign exchange on the value of uncommitted future purchases and sales is not hedged.
As a result, sudden and significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing on to customers the resulting price increases.
For the year ended 31 December 2015 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a gain of 2.0m recognised in equity 2014: gain of 3.0m which will affect the income statement during 2016.
The majority of the Groups borrowings are effectively denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros, aligning them to the respective functional currencies of the component parts of the Groups EBITDA.
This currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency debt.
This currency composition minimises the impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
The currency profile of the Groups net debt at 31 December is set out in the table below: 2015 2014 m m US dollar 563.5 398.6 Sterling 302.3 261.7 Euro 190.9 133.9 Other 50.5 83.2 1,107.2 877.4 If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below.
The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year.
As a result the value of equity is more sensitive than the value of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the resulting movement in profit before tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, and in particular interest rates, remain constant.

The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash at bank and in hand, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank and in hand Note 23, derivative financial instruments see page 106 and trade and other receivables Note 11 is their carrying amount.
Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable credit rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Note 11 sets out an analysis of trade and other receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

The Company is able to control the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, therefore, the timing of the remittance of the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
In general, the Company has determined either that such earnings will not be distributed in the foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit those earnings, no tax liability is expected to arise.
A deferred tax liability of 3.3m 2014: 3.0m has been recognised in exceptional cases where distribution of earnings is both planned and expected to result in a tax liability.
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable that these assets will be realised.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of 9.1m 2014: 8.6m.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 96.2m 2014: 96.2m as it is not considered probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.

Further details of the share plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors remuneration report.
Sharesave Scheme 2011 The Sharesave Scheme 2011, approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, is an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC tax advantaged scheme in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 500 per month 2014: 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme 2011 options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing shortly before the invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
The Sharesave Scheme 2011 replaced the Sharesave Scheme 2001 which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
The Sharesave Scheme 2001 operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
Although there are a small number of options outstanding under the Sharesave Scheme 2001, no further options have been granted under this Scheme since it expired in May 2011. International Sharesave Plan The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2001 by shareholders and was extended following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
The plan operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme 2001 and the Sharesave Scheme 2011 as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of approximately 500 per month 2014: 250 per month being the equivalent value in other currencies over a period of three years.
Irish Sharesave Plan The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2001 by shareholders and was extended following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme 2011.
It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme 2001 and the Sharesave Scheme 2011 as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 500 per month 2014: 300 per month over a period of three years.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2004 LTIP The 2004 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and expired in May 2014.
No further share options or performance share awards have been granted under the 2004 LTIP since that date.
The 2004 LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A of the 2004 LTIP allowed the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant market priced executive share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted up to April 2014 have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding UK RPI inflation over three financial years by a specified margin.
Part B of the 2004 LTIP allowed the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant performance share awards which are conditional rights to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Companys total shareholder return performance relative to a comparator group of companies over a three year period and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding UK RPI inflation over three years by a specified margin.

The 2014 LTIP is also divided into two parts.
Part A of the 2014 LTIP allows the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant market priced executive share options.
The performance condition for the share options granted to date is based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth over three financial years meeting certain specified targets.
Part B of the 2014 LTIP allows the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant performance share awards which are conditional rights to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration.
The extent to which performance share awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Companys total shareholder return performance relative to a comparator group of companies over a three year period and partly subject to the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth over three financial years meeting certain specified targets.
Investment in own shares The Company holds a number of its ordinary shares in an employee benefit trust.
The principal purpose of this trust is to hold shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to certain senior employees and executive directors relating to options granted and awards made in respect of market purchase shares under the 2004 LTIP, the 2014 LTIP and the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme DASBS.
Details of such plans are set out above and in the Directors remuneration report.
The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in the consolidated financial statements.
Finance costs and administration charges are included in the income statement on an accruals basis.
At 31 December 2015 the trust held 6,307,153 2014: 6,527,329 shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 2.0m 2014: 2.1m and market value of 118.9m 2014: 115.1m.

20 Retirement benefits The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the US and in Europe, including the UK, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The funds of the principal defined benefit schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice and local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 Employee Benefits are stated at their bid value.
Characteristics of defined benefit pension schemes Europe In Europe, the Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme is the UK scheme.
The UK defined benefit scheme is a contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 2003.
The valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme has been updated to 31 December 2015 by the Groups actuarial experts.
The UK scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee.
Although the Company bears the financial cost of the scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Company on investment strategy decisions.
A fide-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, whereby investments are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers.
The last full triennial valuation on the UK defined benefit pension scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2012 and showed that there was a deficit on the agreed funding basis.
To address the deficit, the Company has agreed to contribute an additional 5.5m per year from April 2013 to March 2019.
The latest triennial valuation as at April 2015 is ongoing.
114 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 Financial statements | Notes 20 Retirement benefits continued US The principal US defined benefit pension scheme is a non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust by an independent custodian.
The US scheme is a qualified pension scheme and is subject to standard regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue reporting requirements.
The scheme pays annual premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the benefits of the scheme.
The Company has established a Retirement Scheme Investment Committee.
The members of the Committee are the scheme fiduciaries and, as such, are ultimately responsible for the management of the scheme assets.
The Committee performs the oversight function and delegates the day-to-day management process to appropriate staff.
A registered investment adviser advises the Committee regarding the investment of scheme assets.
In 2014, a lump sum payment option was offered to deferred vested and retired participants in the scheme in satisfaction of their future entitlements under the scheme.
The total payment made to the eligible participants who elected to take the lump sum payment option was 25.3m as a result of which the scheme assets and liabilities reduced by this amount.
The scheme rules were changed during 2015 such that all active members will be offered a similar lump sum payment option on retirement.
Annual actuarial valuations are performed on the US defined benefit scheme.
The last annual review was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2015 and showed that there was a required annual contribution of $4.7m.
The Group plans to contribute $8.0m for the 2015 plan year to cover prudently this required contribution and anticipate future funding needs.
In the 2014 plan year, the Group also paid a contribution of $8.0m.
The annual review as at 1 January 2016 is ongoing.
Risks The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the defined benefit pension schemes are described below: Inflation risk the majority of the UK schemes liabilities increase in line with inflation and, as a result, if inflation is greater than expected the liabilities will increase.
The impact of high inflation is capped each year for the UK schemes benefits.
The US schemes liabilities are not directly tied to inflationary increases.
Interest rate risk a fall in bond yields will increase the value of the schemes liabilities.
A proportion of both the UK and US schemes assets are invested in liability matching assets to mitigate the interest rate and also the inflation risk.
Mortality risk the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the schemes and consequently increases in the schemes liabilities.
The mortality assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption.
Investment risk the schemes invest in a diversified range of asset classes to mitigate the risk of falls in any one area of the investments.
In the UK, the trustee implements partial currency hedging on the overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
The risks mentioned above could lead to a material change to the deficit or surplus of the pension schemes.
Given the long term time horizon of the schemes cash flows, the assumptions used can lead to volatility in the scheme valuations from year to year.
The Company and the trustees seek to mitigate actively the risks associated with the schemes.
A higher defined benefit obligation could lead to additional funding requirements in future years.
Any deficit measured on a funding valuation basis, which may differ from the actuarial valuation under IAS 19, will generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are appropriate to the Group and in line with the relevant regulations.

In accordance with IFRIC 14, the surplus on the scheme is recognised as a defined benefit asset because the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus from the UK scheme.

Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through acquisition.
The Group has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
This formal process is applied to each acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation specialists where appropriate.
Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from the relevant acquisition date.
At 31 December 2015 the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 January 2015 remained open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date.
To date the adjustments made have impacted assets acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value.
Similarly, adjustments have been made to acquired liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, deferred consideration and payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired.
IFRS 3 requires that any payments that are contingent on future employment, including payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired, are charged to the income statement.
All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
