In the Investment basis accounts we have disaggregated these line items to analyse our total return as if these investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent with prior years.
The adjustments simply reclassify the Statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under the Investment basis and the IFRS basis.
2 Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries.
Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries line.
This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts.
3 Foreign exchange movements have been reclassified under the Investment basis as foreign currency asset and liability movements within the investment entity subsidiaries are included within Fair value movements on investment entities.
4 Other items also aggregated into the Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries line include fees receivable from external funds, audit fees, custodian fees, bank charges, other general and administration expenses, carried interest and tax.
