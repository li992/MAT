Pension Scheme The companys defined benefit pension scheme based on final salary closed to future accrual on 30 September 2015.
Members of the defined benefits pension scheme were enrolled in the companys defined contribution scheme on 1 October 2015.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.
The scheme is under the control of trustees and is administered by Punter Southall & Co, consulting actuaries.
Actuarial valuations are obtained triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out in 2013 by Punter Southall & Co which disclosed a scheme deficit of 3,406,000 on 31 July 2013.
The company has agreed to meet this deficit over nine years by equal instalments.
It should be noted that this deficit differs from that disclosed by Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS17 which is set out below and which is the liability required to be shown in the financial statements.
The main reason for the difference is that FRS17 requires future liabilities to be calculated actuarially using a rate of return based on the yield from investment grade corporate bonds which is lower than the expected rate of return on the equities in which the scheme is invested.
The FRS17 liability is separately disclosed in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit scheme, the amounts charged against revenue, as part of staff costs, are the actuarial estimation of current service costs that is, the increase in scheme liabilities arising from employee service for the current accounting period and gains and losses from settlements whereby the company is relieved of a pension obligation and from curtailments whereby the estimated years of future service are reduced in the period.
The cost of past service benefits which have vested are charged against revenue as they arise.
Where such benefits have not vested, costs are accrued until vesting occurs.
The company operates a defined contribution scheme under which the company has agreed to pay contributions as a percentage of salary, but has no obligation to pay further contributions.
For this scheme, the amount charged to revenue is the contributions payable for the year.
The following statement has been prepared for the defined benefit scheme in accordance with the requirements of FRS17, the purpose of which is to ensure that: 1. the companys financial statements show the assets of the scheme at fair value, and the liabilities arising from its obligations to employees on their retirement, actuarially estimated as prescribed by FRS17: 2. the operating costs of providing retirement benefits to employees, actuarially estimated, are charged against the profits of the years in which employees earn those benefits: and 3. the financial statements adequately disclose the cost of providing retirement benefits and the related gains, losses, assets and liabilities.

Financial Instruments continued Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the companys net assets and a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
The main risks include investment and market price risk comprising foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors approach to the management of these risks is set out below.
The directors of the company and of SIT Savings Limited coordinate the companys risk management.
The companys policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, which are set out below, have not changed from those applied in the previous year.
Investment and market price risk The holding of securities and investing activities involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur which affect the value of investments.
The company holds a portfolio which is well diversified across industrial and geographical areas to help minimise these risks.
It may also use derivatives.
From time to time, the company may wish to use derivatives in order to protect against a specific risk or to facilitate a change in investment strategy such as the movement of funds from one area to another.
No such transaction may take place without the prior authorisation of the board.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 70% of the companys assets are invested overseas which gives rise to a currency risk.
From time to time, specific hedging transactions are undertaken.
The companys overseas income is subject to currency movements.
The currency profile of the companys monetary assets and liabilities is set out in Notes 8 and 12 on pages 36 and 38.
Management of the risk Management monitors the companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis, and reports to the board at regular intervals.
Management measures the risk to the company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts may be used to limit the companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments or the income received from them.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is receivable and its receipt.
40 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2015 17.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the companys monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at 31 October 2015 and 31 October 2014 are shown below.
US $ Euro Other 2015 000 000 000 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 15,776 141 4,959 Creditors amounts due to brokers 10,684 9,848 Cash 33,981 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 39,073 141 4,889 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 198,084 110,635 232,357 Total net foreign currency exposure 237,157 110,776 227,468 2014 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 412 2,120 2,582 Creditors amounts due to brokers 2,473 1,999 2,021 Cash 3,254 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 1,193 121 561 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 277,359 134,050 206,763 Total net foreign currency exposure 278,552 134,171 207,324 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
The maximum and minimum net monetary assets liabilities amounts for each currency were as follows.
US $ Euro Other Year to 31 October 2015 000 000 000 Maximum 39,021 13,036 6,500 Minimum 793 7,982 Year to 31 October 2014 Maximum 69,567 1,090 11,970 Minimum 781 1,960 Report & Accounts 2015 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC 41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2015 17.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the shareholders funds in regard to the companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
It assumes a 10% depreciation of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro at 31 October 2015.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous twelve months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
2015 2014 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 If sterling had weakened by 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Revenue return 580 473 478 357 Capital return 23,699 11,064 27,814 13,405 Return attributable to shareholders 24,279 11,537 28,292 13,762 A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.
c. Interest rate risk The company finances its operations through a combination of investment realisations, retained revenue reserves, debenture stocks and secured bonds.
All debenture stocks and secured bonds are at fixed rates.
Details of interest rates on financial assets are included in note 8 on page 37.
Details of interest rates on financial liabilities are included in note 12 on page 38.
Management of the risk The company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which have been approved and are monitored by the board.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at the year end, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates.
2015 2014 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash 14,815 14,815 12,974 12,974 Exposure to fixed interest rates Short-term deposits 59,138 59,138 70,000 70,000 Long-term borrowings 104,399 104,399 104,283 104,283 Total exposure 73,953 104,399 30,446 82,974 104,283 21,309 42 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2015 17.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had decreased by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the return attributable to shareholders as shown on the Income Statement would have decreased by the amounts shown in the table below: 2015 2014 000 000 Return attributable to shareholders 11 12 A 5% increase in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
d. Liquidity risk Almost all of the companys assets comprise listed securities which represent a ready source of funds.
In addition, the company has access to short-term borrowing facilities.
The maturity profile of the companys borrowings is included in note 12 on page 38.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not as significant as the other risks as most of the companys assets are investments in quoted equities and are readily realisable.
The manager reviews the liquidity of the portfolio when making investment decisions.
e. Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the company suffering a loss.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
Cash comprises balances held by banks with a satisfactory credit rating 2014: same.
Management of the risk This risk is managed as follows: by only dealing with brokers and banks which have been approved by the audit committee and which have credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and by setting limits on the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time, which are reviewed semi-annually at meetings of the audit committee.
f. Capital management policies and procedures The company carries on its business as a global growth investment trust.
Its objective is to provide investors, over the longer term, with above-average returns through a diversified portfolio of international equities and to achieve dividend growth ahead of UK inflation.
The levels of gearing and gross gearing are monitored closely by the board and the manager.
The company applies a ceiling on gearing of 20%.
While gearing will be employed in a typical range of 0% to 20%, the company retains the ability to lower equity exposure to a net cash position if deemed appropriate.
The board, with the assistance of the management, monitors and reviews the structure of the companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the planned level of gearing which will take into account the managements view on the market, the need to buy back shares for cancellation and the level of dividends.
The companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the previous year.

Financial Instruments continued Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from information other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques not based on observable market data.
2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 772,344 1,892 774,236 There were no transfers between Level 1 & 2 during the year 2014: same.
