These risks arise in the normal course of business, and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Groups portfolio risk management strategy.
The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Groups financial targets while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Groups operations and activities.
A Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework is used to measure the aggregate and diversified impact of financial risks upon the Groups financial targets.
The principal measurement of risk is CFaR measured on a portfolio basis, which is defined as the worst expected loss relative to projected business plan cash flows over a one-year horizon under normal market conditions at a confidence level of 90 per cent.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices.
Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.
This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings which is measured under the CFaR framework.
In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities.
The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes: Activity Key risk management processes 1 Risk mitigation On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to Execution of transactions within approved mandates.

Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and or at a fixed interest rate, fair value and cash flow hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Groups functional currency of US dollars and or to swap to a floating interest rate.
3 Strategic financial transactions Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture Exposures managed within value at risk and value from perceived market over under valuations.
Execution of transactions within approved mandates.
Primary responsibility for identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Group Management Committee.
BHP Billiton Annual Report 2015 233 7 Financial Statementscontinued 23 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments.
Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
The majority of the Groups debt is issued at fixed interest rates.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of its fixed interest rate exposure to floating US dollar interest rate exposure.
As at 30 June 2015, 89 per cent of Group borrowings were exposed to floating interest rates inclusive of the effect of swaps 2014: 84 per cent.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are shown in the fair values section of this note.
Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2015, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups equity and profit after taxation by US$149 million 2014: decrease of US$126 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant over the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups potential currency exposures comprise: translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items: and transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues.
The Groups foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from financial assets and liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar: 2015 2014 Net financial liabilities assets by currency of denomination US$M US$M Australian dollars 2,239 4,684 Chilean peso 665 267 Other 5 6 Total 2,909 4,945 The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar and Chilean peso.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2015, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant, would decrease increase profit after taxation and equity as follows: 2015 2014 US$M US$M Profit after Profit after Currency movement against US$ taxation Equity taxation Equity 1 cent strengthening in Australian dollar 12 12 31 31 10 pesos strengthening in Chilean peso 7 7 3 3 The Groups financial asset and liability profile may not remain constant and therefore these sensitivities should be used with care.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
When required under this strategy the Group enters into forward exchange contracts.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding to manage short-term foreign currency cash flows relating to operating activities is an asset of US$1 million and a liability of US$ nil 2014: an asset of US$ nil and a liability of US$ nil.
234 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2015 6 Legal proceedings 7 Financial Statements 8 Glossary 9 Shareholder information 23 Financial risk management continued Commodity price risk Contracts for the sale and physical delivery of commodities are executed whenever possible on a pricing basis intended to achieve a relevant index target.
While the Group has succeeded in transitioning the majority of Group commodity production sales to market-based index pricing terms, derivative commodity contracts may from time-to-time be used to align realised prices with the relevant index.
Contracts for the physical delivery of commodities are not typically financial instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at cost typically at nil : they are therefore excluded from the fair value and sensitivity tables below.
Accordingly, the financial instrument exposures set out in the tables below do not represent all of the commodity price risks managed according to the Groups objectives.
Movements in the fair value of contracts included in the tables below are offset by movements in the fair value of the physical contracts, however only the former movement is recognised in the Groups income statement prior to settlement.
The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Financial instruments with commodity price risk included in the following tables are primarily derivatives embedded in physical commodity purchase and sales contracts.
All such instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value.

Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales and purchases arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair value through profit and loss as part of trade receivables or trade payables.
The Groups exposure at 30 June 2015 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales and purchases volumes is set out in the following table: 2015 2014 Impact on equity Impact on equity and profit after and profit after taxation of 10% taxation of 10% Netexposure increase in Netexposure increase in deliver market price deliver market price Units of exposure receive US$M receive US$M Provisionally priced commodity sales contracts Copper Tonnes 000s 363 173 350 246 Zinc Tonnes 000s 4 1 11 2 Lead Tonnes 000s 29 6 Gold Ounces 23,975 2 19,401 2 Silver Ounces 000s 1,231 2 5,072 10 Nickel Tonnes 000s 4 4 3 5 Iron Ore Tonnes 000s 2,876 14 588 5 Provisionally priced commodity purchases contracts Copper Tonnes 000s 32 18 24 17 Zinc Tonnes 000s 4 1 4 1 Silver Ounces 000s 850 1 526 1 The sensitivities in the above tables have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10 per cent increase in commodity prices at each reporting date, while holding all other variables, including foreign currency and exchange rates, constant.
The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity prices.
The sensitivities should therefore be used with care.
Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.
Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with short-term and long-term forecast information.
Additional liquidity risk arises on debt related derivatives due to the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.
The Groups strong credit profile, diversified funding sources and committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.
The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposure ensures that only counterparties of an investment grade standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
During the year ended 30 June 2015, Moodys Investors Service made no change to the Groups long-term credit rating of A1 the short-term credit rating is P-1.
Standard & Poors also affirmed the Groups long-term credit rating of A the short-term credit rating is A-1 : however, revised their outlook from stable to negative.
There were no defaults on loans payable during the period.
Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities Details of major standby and support arrangements are as follows: 2015 2014 Facility Facility US$M available Drawn Undrawn available Drawn Undrawn a Revolving credit facility 6,000 6,000 6,000 6,000 Total financing facilities 6,000 6,000 6,000 6,000 a The Groups committed US$6.0 billion revolving credit facility operates as a back-stop to the Groups uncommitted commercial paper program.
The combined amount drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$6.0 billion.
As at 30 June 2015, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn 2014: US$ nil, therefore US$6.0 billion of committed facility was available to use 2014: US$6.0 billion.
The revolving credit facility has a five-year maturity with one remaining one-year extension option.
A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balance and an interest rate comprising an interbank rate plus a margin applies to any drawn balance.
The agreed margins are typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Groups credit rating.

Refer to note 21 Other financial assets.
BHP Billiton Annual Report 2015 237 7 Financial Statementscontinued 23 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk can arise from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group.
To manage credit risk, the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits, proactive monitoring of exposures against these limits and requirements triggering secured payment terms.
As part of these processes, the credit exposures to all counterparties are regularly monitored and assessed on a timely basis.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying amount of relevant financial assets on the balance sheet, as at the reporting date.
The Groups credit risk exposures are categorised under the following headings: Counterparties The Group conducts transactions with the following major types of counterparties: Receivables counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers are made on open terms.
Secured payment counterparties Approximately half of sales to the Groups customers occur via secured payment mechanisms.
Derivative counterparties Counterparties to derivative contracts consist of a diverse number of financial institutions and industrial counterparties in the relevant markets.
Cash investment counterparties As part of managing cash flow and liquidity, the Group holds short-term cash investments with a range of approved financial institutions.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty.
Geographic The Group trades in all major geographic regions.
Countries in which the Group has significant revenue exposures include Australia, the United States, Europe, China, Japan, India and South Korea.
Where appropriate, secured payment mechanisms and other risk mitigation instruments are used to protect revenues from credit risk losses.
Industry In line with our asset portfolio, the Group sells into a diverse range of industries and customer sectors.
This diversity means that the Group is not dominantly exposed to any individual industry or customer.
The following table shows the Groups receivables at the reporting date that are exposed to credit risk and the ageing and impairment profile thereon: Receivables Receivables past due but not impaired Receivables neither past 2015 Gross past due and due nor Less than 31 to 61 to Over US$M amount impaired impaired 30 days 60 days 90 days 90 days Trade receivables 2,988 6 2,972 8 2 Other receivables 2,849 11 2,653 66 11 30 78 Total 5,837 17 5,625 74 13 30 78 Receivables Receivables past due but not impaired Receivables neither past 2014 Gross past due and due nor Less than 31 to 61 to Over US$M amount impaired impaired 30 days 60 days 90 days 90 days Trade receivables 4,735 115 4,562 46 12 Other receivables 4,005 17 3,761 9 26 33 159 Total 8,740 132 8,323 55 26 33 171 Receivables are deemed to be past due or impaired with reference to the Groups normal terms and conditions of business.
These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customers credit quality and prevailing market conditions.
Receivables that are classified as past due in the above tables are those that have not been settled within the payments terms that have been agreed with that customer.
For an analysis of movements in impaired trade receivables, refer to note 8 Trade and other receivables.
The credit quality of the Groups customers is monitored on an ongoing basis and assessed for impairment where indicators of such impairment exist.
The solvency of each debtor and their ability to repay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.
In certain circumstances the Group may seek collateral as security for the receivable.
Where receivables have been impaired, the Group actively seeks to recover the amounts in question and enforce compliance with credit terms.
An impairment of US$15 million was recognised during the year ended 30 June 2015 2014: US$ nil relating to other financial assets, refer to note 3 Expenses.

240 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2015 6 Legal proceedings 7 Financial Statements 8 Glossary 9 Shareholder information 23 Financial risk management continued Valuation hierarchy The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated with reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Groups views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.
The inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant Group Function.
Our Group Functions support the Businesses and operate under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Group Management Committee.
Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.
