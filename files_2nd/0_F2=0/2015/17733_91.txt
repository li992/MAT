These include reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
The relevant deferred tax balances have been remeasured accordingly.
A deferred tax liability of 1 million 2014: nil has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings.
The deferred tax relates to non-recoverable withholding tax which will be suffered on dividends to be paid in 2016.
No other deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings will qualify for the UK dividend exemption and the Group can control the distribution of dividends by its subsidiaries.
In some countries, local tax is payable on the remittance of a dividend.
Were dividends to be remitted from these countries, the additional tax payable would be 15 million.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 6 million 2014: 6 million of which 6 million 2014: 6 million relates to carried forward tax losses as our forecasts indicate that these assets will not reverse in the near future.
Deferred tax assets of 18 million 2014: 18 million have been recognised in respect of entities which have suffered a loss in either the current orpreceding period.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis it is probable there will be future taxable profits against which they can be utilised.
The majority of these assets can be carried forward indefinitely.
