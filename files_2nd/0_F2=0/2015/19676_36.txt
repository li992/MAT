Directors Report SSEs financial results explained March 2014 March 2013 March 2015 restated restated m m m SSEs results on an adjusted basis: Adjusted operating profit 1,881.4 1,880.1 1,779.0 Adjusted net finance costs 316.7 329.0 363.9 Adjusted Profit before Tax PBT 1,564.7 1,551.1 1,415.1 Adjusted current tax charge 224.8 236.7 223.6 Adjusted Profit after Tax PAT 1,339.9 1,314.4 1,191.5 Hybrid coupon paid 121.3 122.9 63.4 Adjusted Profit after Tax for EPS 1,218.6 1,191.5 1,128.1 Weighted average number of shares for adjusted EPS 981.8 965.5 952.0 Adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS pence 124.1 123.4 118.5 Reported profit measures for the comparative periods have been restated following a change in the accounting classification of the groups joint operation Great Gabbard Offshore Wind Ltd under FRS11.
No impact on adjusted profit measures has arisen from this change.
Why do we have Adjusted numbers for Profit Before Tax PBT, Profit After Tax PAT, Earnings Per Share EPS and Net Debt and Hybrid Capital?
SSEs financial statements are prepared using the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
SSE also publishes a number of financial measures on an Adjusted basis to give, what it believes are, a more meaningful and comparable set of numbers.
These adjustments fall into the following categories: 1 Movements on derivatives IFRSs require certain contracts to buy or sell electricity, gas and other commodities for use in the future to be recognised at fair value at each year end.
The fair value measures the contract price against the market price over the period of the contract.
Under IFRS, the change in this value each year is included in the income statement.
SSE excludes this item from its Adjusted numbers as the movement in fair value does not crystallise until contract delivery and may never crystallise if the market price changes.
2 Exceptional Items In order to ensure results are comparable year on year, exceptional items are separately identified and disclosed.
3 Interest on net pension liabilities IAS 19R International Accounting Standard IAS 19R relating to defined benefit pension schemes requires the income statement to reflect a theoretical interest payment on net pension liabilities.
This interest is theoretical, non-cash and likely to fluctuate year on year and does not reflect company performance, therefore SSE excludes this item from its adjusted profit measures.
4 Tax and interest on JCEs and Associates IFRSs require operating profit to include the PAT of any Joint Ventures JVs or Associate companies.
SSE believes it is clearer to include all Group results at operating profit level.
Therefore SSEs Adjusted Operating Profit makes an adjustment to add interest and tax on JVs and Associates back to the result.
This has no impact on the Group Profit after Tax.
5 Deferred tax As it is a non-cash item, SSE adjusts for deferred tax when arriving at adjusted profit after tax.
6 Hybrid capital securities The characteristics of hybrid capital securities mean they qualify for recognition as equity rather than debt under IFRSs and their coupon payments are presented within dividends rather than within interest.
To ensure simple and comparable presentation within its adjusted EPS measure, SSE makes an adjustment to reduce earnings by the coupon paid in the year.
For the same reasons, SSE presents adjusted net debt and hybrid capital together as one balance.
7 Finance lease Under IFRSs, net debt includes a finance lease liability based primarily upon the Power Purchase Agreement PPA SSE has in place with Marchwood power station.
In order to better reflect the true net debt position, SSE removes this when arriving at adjusted net debt.
8 Outstanding liquid funds Outstanding liquid funds are SSE cash balances held by counterparties as collateral at the year end.
SSE includes these as cash until they are utilised.
The table below reconciles the Operating Profit, PBT, Net Debt, Tax and Net Interest reported under IFRS with the SSE Adjusted numbers.
