com 188 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS Dividend history Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its ordinary shares in every year since 1937.
Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000, the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the Selected financial data, toordinary dividends declared for the year.
This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments.
From 2000 to 2004, the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times.
Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%.
Following the redenomination of the Companys share capital into US Dollars, the Board re-affirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US Dollar terms.
On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of ordinary dividends over time broadly based on the Groups underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and cash flows.
At the time of the full year results, the Board reviews the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year.
The Board intendsthat the interim dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year.
Dividends will continue to be declared in US Dollars with an equivalent amount in Sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is inthe UK, or who have validly elected to receive Sterling dividends.
An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November.
A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings: the future financial condition of the Group: the Boards dividend policy: and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in Special note regarding forward-looking statements and Risk Factors.
Dividends per share The table below sets out the dividends per ordinary share in the last five years.
2 2015 final dividend does not include a UK tax credit.
Dividends above include the associated UK tax credit of 10%, but exclude the deduction of withholding taxes, up to and including the interim dividend for 2015.
From 6 April 2016, please note that dividends below 5,000 per tax year will be tax free and dividends above 5,000 per tax year will be subject to personal income tax at the rate of 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers.
A self-assessment form will therefore be required.
This will apply to both cash and DRIP dividends, although dividends paid on shares held within pensions and ISAs will be unaffected, remaining tax free.
Since the second interim dividend for 2005, all dividends have been declared in US cents per ordinary share.
The 2015 final dividend will be payable on 11 May 2016, subject to shareholder approval.
In respect of the proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 19.0 US cents per ordinary share, the record date will be 22 April 2016 and the payment date will be 11 May 2016.
The Sterling equivalent per ordinary share will be set following the record date.
Shareholders may elect to receive their dividend in either Sterling or US Dollars and the last day for election will be 22 April 2016.
The ordinary shares will trade ex-dividend on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges from 21 April 2016.
The proposed final dividend of 19.0 US cents per ordinary share, which together with the interim dividend of 11.8 US cents, makes a total for 2015 of 30.8 US cents.

com 190 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS Share Capital The principal trading market for the ordinary shares is the London Stock Exchange.
The ordinary shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
Each ADS represents two ordinary shares from 14 October 2014, before which time one ADS represented five ordinary shares.
The ADS facility is sponsored by Deutsche Bank acting as depositary.
All the ordinary shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other.
On 23 January 2006, the 2 ordinary shares of 12 9p were redenominated as ordinary shares of US 20 cents following approval by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting in December 2005.
The new US Dollar ordinary shares carry the same rights as the previous ordinary shares.
The share price continues to be quoted in Sterling.
In 2006, the Company issued 50,000 of shares in Sterling in order to comply with English law.
These were issued as deferred shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange.
They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value.
These shares were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish.
Shareholdings As at 23 February 2016, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 17,487 registered holders of ordinary shares, of whom 91 had registered addresses in the USA and held a total of 187,058 ordinary shares 0.02% of the total issued.
Because certain ordinary shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the USA is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of ordinary shares resident in the USA.
As at 23 February 2016, 28,257,095 ADSs equivalent to 56,514,190 ordinary shares or approximately 6.31% of the total ordinary shares in issue, were outstanding and were held by 87 registered ADS holders.
Major shareholders As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and the Group has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Group.
As at 23 February 2016, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any interest as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FCA in 3% or more of the ordinary shares, other than as shown below.
The following tables show changes over the last three years in the percentage and numbers of the issued share capital owned by shareholders holding 3% or more of ordinary shares, as notified to the Company under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules: As at 31 December 23 February 2016 2015 2014 2013 % % % % BlackRock, Inc. 5.2 5.2 5.5 4.7 Invesco 6.0 5.7 5.3 12.1 As at 31 December 23 February 2016 2015 2014 2013 000 000 000 000 BlackRock, Inc. 46,427 46,427 49,008 41,870 Invesco 53,693 51,539 47,508 107,823 The Company is not aware of any person who has a significant direct or indirect holding of securities in the Company, and is not aware of any persons holding securities which may control the Company.
There are no securities in issue which have special rights as to the control of the Company.
Purchase of ordinary shares on behalf of the Company At the AGM, the Company will be seeking a renewal of its current permission from shareholders to purchase up to 10% of its own shares.
In order to avoid shareholder dilution, shares allotted to employees through employee share schemes are bought back on a quarterly basis and subsequently cancelled by the Company.

com 191 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephews securities, except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her Majestys Treasury of the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of certain countries.
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the Articles of Association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of ordinary shares, except that where any overseas shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document to an overseas address.
It is, however, the current practice of the Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details of the Companys dividend reinvestment plan, which are not sent to shareholders with recorded addresses in the USA and Canada.
Taxation information for shareholders The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the Groups understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US federal income tax law and practice relevant to the ADSs and ordinary shares not in ADS form.
The comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the USA, a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organised in or under the laws of the USA or any State therein, or an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source each a US Holder.
The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary shares that may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the Companys issued ordinary shares.
This discussion does not apply to i persons whose holding of ADSs or ordinary shares is effectively connected with or pertains to either a permanent establishment in the UK through which a US Holder carries on a business in the UK or a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal services in the UK, or ii persons whose registered address is inside the UK.
This discussion does not apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers and traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of tax accounting, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US Dollar and US Holders liable for alternative minimum tax.
In addition, the comments below do not address the potential application of the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code, known as the Medicare contribution tax, or any US state, local or non-US other than UK taxes.
The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets.
The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax consequences to them of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary shares.
The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company was not a passive foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 31 December 2015.
This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
For purposes of US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs.
However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary pre-released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary shares.
Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders.
Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released.
Taxation of dividends in the UK and the USA The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK corporation, such as the Company.
Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to the extent paid out of the Companys current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes.
Because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under US federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions generally will be reported to US Holders as dividends.
Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders.
Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than those applicable to other types of ordinary income if certain conditions are met.
Non-corporate US Holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates.
com 192 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS Taxation of capital gains US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares unless the ADSs or ordinary shares are held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through a permanent establishment or in the case of individuals, through a branch or agency.
Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or ordinary shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while non-resident.
For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares by US Holders generally will be US source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADSs or ordinary shares were held for more than one year.
The amount of a US Holders gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised on the sale or other disposition and such holders tax basis in the ADSs, or ordinary shares, each determined in US Dollars.
Inheritance and estate taxes The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death.
The HM Revenue & Customs considers that the US UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance tax.
Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the USA and is not a UK national or domiciled in the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares.
A UK national who is domiciled in the USA will be subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares in computing the liability to UK inheritance tax.
Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the UK will be entitled to a credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax.
Special rules apply where ADSs and ordinary shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the UK.
US information reporting and backup withholding Payments of dividends on, or proceeds from the sale of, ADSs or ordinary shares that are made within the USA or through certain US-related financial intermediaries generally will be subject to US information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless a US Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met.
US backup withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends.
Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holders US federal income tax liability, and, where the backup withholding exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund claim with the US Internal Revenue Service.
Certain US Holders who are individuals and under proposed Treasury regulations, certain entities may be required to report information relating to securities issued by a non-US person or foreign accounts through which the securities are held, subject to certain exceptions including an exception for securities held in accounts maintained by US financial institutions.
US Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the transfer of registered ownership of ordinary shares.
Transfers of ordinary shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of % of the consideration given for the transfer with the duty rounded up to the nearest 5.
UK stamp duty reserve tax SDRT arises when there is an agreement to transfer shares in UK companies for consideration in money or moneys worth, and so an agreement to transfer ordinary shares for money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of % rounded up to the nearest penny.
The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid.
Transfers of ordinary shares into CREST an electronic transfer system are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the ordinary shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that will ensure that the securities become held in uncertificated form within CREST.
Paperless transfers of ordinary shares within CREST for consideration in money or moneys worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty.
SDRT on relevant transactions will be collected by CREST at %, and this will apply whether or not the transfer is effected in the UK and whether or not the parties to it are resident or situated in the UK.
A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1% of the consideration or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned will arise on a transfer or issue of ordinary shares to the depositary or to certain persons providing a clearance service or their nominees or agents for the conversion into ADRs and will generally be payable by the depositary or person providing clearance service.
In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable by the depositary on deposits of ordinary shares will be charged by the depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits.
No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the UK the location of the custodian as a holder of ordinary shares not being relevant in this context.
In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT.

Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and then shall be eligible for re-election by the shareholders.
The other Directors retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed.

The Directors are subject to removal with or without cause by the Board or the shareholders.
Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification.
Under the Companys Articles of Association and English law, a Director may be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities he may sustain or incur in the execution of his duties.
Rights attaching to ordinary shares Under English law, dividends are payable on the Companys ordinary shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK and by the Companies Act 2006.
Holders of the Companys ordinary shares are entitled to receive final dividends as may be declared by the Directors and approved by the shareholders in general meeting, rateable according to the amounts paid up on such shares, provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Directors.
The Companys Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified by the Companys financial position.
If authorised by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, the Board may also direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of the Company.
Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to the Company.
There were no material modifications to the rights of shareholders under the Articles during 2016.
Voting rights of ordinary shares Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held.
On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held.
On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for each ordinary share held by that shareholder.
A poll may be demanded by any of the following: the chairman of the meeting: at least five shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on the resolution: any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution: or any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.
A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one, as above.
The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two shareholders present in person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the business to be transacted.
com 194 OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds: ordinary or special resolutions: Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of Directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration of dividends other than interim dividends, the appointment and re-appointment of auditors or the grant of authority to allot shares.
An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there is a quorum.
Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Companys Articles of Association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or changing the Companys name: modifying the rights of any class of the Companys shares at a meeting of the holders of such class or relating to certain matters concerning the Companys winding up.
A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes of the persons voting at the meeting at which there is a quorum.
Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 21 days.
Other general meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of at least 14 clear days.
The days of delivery or receipt of notice are not included.
The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted.
Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors.
Members with 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company may requisition the Board to convene a meeting.
Variation of rights If, at any time, the Companys share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.
At every such separate meeting, all the provisions of the articles of association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum is to be the number of persons which must be two or more who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class and at any such meeting a poll may be demanded in writing by any person or their proxy who hold shares of that class.
Where a person is present by proxy or proxies, he is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights.
Rights in a winding up Except as the Companys shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon the Companys winding up, the balance of assets available for distribution: after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors: and subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares: is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them.
This distribution is generally to be made in US Dollars.
A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of any extraordinary resolution of the shareholders and any other sanction required by law, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the Companys assets in kind.
Limitations on voting and shareholding There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Companys Articles of Association on the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote the Companys ordinary shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the Companys shareholders.
Transfers of shares The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in certificated form which: are not fully paid provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in such a way as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis : are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the Transfer Office or at such other place as the Board may appoint and save in the case of a transfer by a person to whom no certificate was issued in respect of the shares in question accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do: are in respect of more than one class of shares: or are in favour of more than four transferees.
Deferred shares Following the re-denomination of share capital on 23 January 2006, the ordinary shares nominal value became 20 US cents each.
There were no changes to the rights or obligations of the ordinary shares.
In order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, a new class of Sterling shares was created, deferred shares, of which 50,000 were issued and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive Officer though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish.
These deferred shares have no voting or dividend rights and on winding up only are entitled to repayment at nominal value only if all ordinary shareholders have received the nominal value of their shares plus an additional $1,000 each.
Amendments The Company does not have any special rules about amendments to its Articles of Association beyond those imposed by law.
