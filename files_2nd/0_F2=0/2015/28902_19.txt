108 Financial statements Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies RSA Insurance Group plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Company through its subsidiaries and associates together the Group or RSA provides personal and commercial insurance products to its global customer base, principally in the UK & Ireland, Scandinavia and Canada.
1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union EU.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis.
Where other bases are applied these are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
In line with industry practice, the Groups statement of financial position is not presented using current and non-current classifications, but broadly in increasing order of liquidity.
Most of the Groups assets and liabilities are considered current given they are expected to be realised or settled within the Groups normal operating cycle.
The assets and liabilities considered as non-current include: investments in associates, deferred tax assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred tax liabilities, outstanding debt including loan capital and elements of financial investments, insurance contract liabilities and reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
Except where otherwise stated, all figures included in the consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of pounds Sterling m. The structure of the financial statements has been amended from prior years to make them more understandable for the shareholders.
Accounting policies that are significant to understanding the performance, financial position and cashflows of the Group are set out in note 5 with other policies presented in Appendix B.
The notes are grouped together by their nature.
Estimation techniques and assumptions are now presented in the relevant note in order to provide context to the figures presented.
The most significant estimates and judgements are those used in determining Insurance contract liabilities note 37, Deferred tax note 30 and Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities note 38.
All of the information previously disclosed continues to be presented, where material, within the financial statements.
2 Adoption of new and revised standards There are a small number of narrow scope amendments arising from annual improvements to standards that are applicable to the Group for the first time in 2015, none of which have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
3 Recently issued accounting pronouncements IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The IASB has issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments although the timing for its implementation is not yet clear as the standard has not yet been endorsed by the European Union.
The new standard is stated to be effective from 1 January 2018, although depending on the outcome of consultations on IFRS 4, there may be a transitional period.
In December 2015, the IASB consulted on proposed amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance contracts.
The amendments would permit entities whose predominant activity is issuing insurance contracts to defer the full application of IFRS 9 until the earlier of 2021 or adopting the revised IFRS 4, which is currently expected to commence in 2020.
The Group will decide on appropriate clarification of its investments under IFRS 9 closer to the time of adopting the revised IFRS 4 and so is not able at the present time to fully quantify the impact of adopting IFRS 9 on its financial statements.
It is not anticipated however that it will significantly change the Groups total equity.
IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition The date that IFRS 15 Revenue Recognition which has not yet been endorsed by the European Union becomes effective has been delayed until 1 January 2018.
Revenue arising from insurance contacts and financial instruments is outside the scope of IFRS 15.
The impact of recognising the revenue from other Group services when these services are delivered to customers is not expected to be material to the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases to replace the existing standard IAS 17 which, subject to endorsement by the European Union, will be effective from 1 January 2019 but with earlier adoption permitted.
The main change under IFRS 16 is to the accounting by lessees.
For operating leases, IFRS 16 will require the recognition of the present value of a lessees full payment obligations in the statement of financial position together with an asset representing the right to the use of the leased asset during the term of the lease.
Under IAS 17, for leases qualifying as operating leases, the lease obligations are not recognised in the statement of financial position.
The Group has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of IFRS 16 on the financial statements but the undiscounted value of the Groups lease obligations are disclosed in note 41.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 109 4 Re-presentation of financial statements and disclosures During 2015, the Group sold a number of its businesses and classified a number of other businesses as held for sale where it has become highly probable that their value to the business will be recovered principally through their sale, rather than through continuing operations.
Where these businesses represented a separate geographical area of operations, the business has been classified as a discontinued operation see note 7 for further details.
This has resulted in the re-presentation of the comparatives for the allocation of the loss after tax from continuing operations, the other comprehensive income, the earnings per share EPS and diluted EPS between the amounts from continuing and discontinued operations.
In 2014, and further refined in 2015, additional changes have been made to the management basis used to determine the underwriting, investment results and central expenses.
The Segmental information set out in note 9 has been re-presented on the revised basis.
The table below sets out the changes when compared to year-end 2014 as reported, the net effect is nil: 31 December 2014 Underwriting Investment Central Result Result Expenses Total m m m m As reported 90 327 52 365 Re-presented basis 41 343 19 365 Difference 49 16 33 - 5 Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, as set out below, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
The Group has not made any significant changes to its accounting policies during 2015.
Premium income Premium written is recognised in the period in which the Group is legally bound through a contract to provide insurance cover.
It represents the full amount of premiums receivable under the contract, including any estimates where the amounts are not known at the date written.
These are recognised as unearned premiums until recognised as revenue principally computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis.
Net premiums earned are stated net of amounts passed ceded to reinsurers.
Premiums are shown before deduction of commission and exclude any sales based taxes or duties.
Gross claims incurred and insurance contract liabilities Gross claims incurred represent the cost of investigating and settling insurance claims on insurance contracts underwritten by the Group.
Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded at the estimated ultimate cost, net of expected salvage and subrogation recoveries when a claim is incurred.
The provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses, and related reinsurance recoveries, are discounted where there is a long period from incident to claims settlement or when nominal interest rates are high and where there exists a suitable claims payment pattern from which to calculate the discount.
In defining those claims with a long period from incident to claims settlement, an average period of settlement of six years or more has been used as a guide.
The discount rate used is based upon an investment return expected to be earned by assets which are appropriate in value and duration to match the provisions for insurance contract liabilities being discounted during the period expected before the final settlement of such claims.
Differences between the estimated cost and subsequent settlement of claims or re-estimated costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are settled or in which the insurance contract liabilities are re-estimated.
Acquisition costs comprise the direct and indirect costs of obtaining and processing new insurance business.
These costs are recognised as deferred acquisition costs and are deducted from the provision for unearned premium.
Deferred acquisition costs DAC are amortised on the same basis as the related unearned premiums are earned.
At the end of each reporting period tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of the Groups insurance contract liabilities by considering the cashflows associated with the provision for unearned premium net of related deferred acquisition costs.
In performing these tests, best estimates of future contractual cashflows, including claims handling and administrative expenses as well as investment income on assets backing such liabilities are used.
Any deficiency is charged to the consolidated income statement immediately by establishing a provision for liability adequacy known as the unexpired risk provision.
The unexpired risk provision is assessed in aggregate for business classes which are managed together and where there are no restraints on the ability to use assets held in relation to such business to meet any of the associated liabilities.
Further information on net claims can be found in note 11, and insurance contract liabilities in note 37.
110 Financial statements Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Reinsurance Written premiums ceded to a reinsurer are recognised in the period in which the reinsurance contract is entered into and include estimates where the amounts are not finalised at the end of the reporting period.
The ceded written premiums are recognised in earnings over the period of the reinsurance contract, based on the expected earning pattern in relation to the underlying insurance contract s. Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities within the consolidated statement of financial position includes the reinsurers share of provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums.
The Group reports thirdparty reinsurance balances on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis to indicate the extent of credit risk related to third-party reinsurance.
The amount recoverable is reduced when there is an event arising after the initial recognition that provides objective evidence that the Group may not receive all amounts due under the reinsurance contract.
Annuities purchased by the Group to provide for payments under structured settlement arrangements are accounted for as reinsurance ceded and a corresponding reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities in cases where the Group remains liable for the settlement in the event of default by the annuity provider.
Any gain or loss arising on the purchase of an annuity is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the date of purchase.
Further information can be found in note 29.
Financial Instruments Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group initially recognises financial instruments at their fair value on the date at which they are purchased.
At initial measurement, the Group classifies its financial assets and financial liabilities in one of the following categories: Designated at fair value through profit and loss FVTPL : Held for trading: Available for sale AFS : Cash and cash equivalents: Loans and receivables: Financial liabilities: or Derivatives designated as hedging instruments.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and financial liabilities that are FVTPL are added to their fair value in their initial measurement.
Further information can be found in note 26, note 27 and note 28.

Investment Income Dividends on equity investments are recognised as investment income in the consolidated income statement on the date at which the investment is priced ex dividend.
Interest income is recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Unrealised gains and losses on AFS investments are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary items which are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On derecognition of an investment classified as available for sale, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Further information can be found in note 10.
Impairment of financial instruments The Group determines, at each reporting date, whether there is evidence that the value of a financial asset or a group of financial assets, other than those measured as FVTPL, are impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence that indicates that an event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that may have resulted in a loss of value as a result of having a negative effect on the estimated future cashflows generated by that asset which can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of debt instruments is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cashflows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised using the effective interest rate method.
For equity securities whose fair values are readily determined and where there is objective evidence that such an asset is impaired by a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below cost, the net loss previously charged to other comprehensive income is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
If the fair value of a previously impaired debt security increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed and the reversal recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed.
Strategic Report Directors and Corporate Governance Report Financial statements Other Information Financial statements Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 113 Taxation and deferred tax Taxation and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Taxation is based on profits and income for the year as determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation, together with adjustments for prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the related deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and principal associated undertakings is recognised as an expense in the year in which the profits arise, except where the remittance of earnings can be controlled and it is probable that remittance will not take place in the foreseeable future, in which case the tax charge is recognised on the dividends received.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which unused tax losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
Post-retirement benefits and obligations The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the underlying employment services are provided to the Group.
A defined benefit scheme refers to any other pension scheme: specifically, the Groups defined benefit schemes define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
The value of the net defined benefit liability asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position for each individual post-retirement scheme is calculated as the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations of the scheme and the fair value of the scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled.
For those schemes in a net liability deficit position, the net liability is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in provisions.
For those schemes in a net asset surplus position, the asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in other debtors and other assets only to the extent that the Group can realise an economic benefit, in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions, at some point during the life of the scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled.
The amounts charged or credited where relevant in the consolidated income statement relating to post-retirement defined benefit schemes are as follows: The current service cost: this is the present value of additional benefits payable for employees services provided during the reporting period: The past service costs and gains or losses on settlements: these are changes to the obligations already established for past service costs that have arisen from an amendment to the terms of the scheme amendment or a curtailment of the benefits payable by the scheme.
These are recognised at the earlier of when the terms of the scheme are amended or the curtailment occurs or, where applicable, when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits: Net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset : this is determined by applying the discount rate applied to the defined benefit obligation for the period to the net defined benefit liability asset, and results in a net interest expense income: The administration costs of operating the pension schemes.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability asset recognised in other comprehensive income comprises actuarial gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions and experience adjustments in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation, and return on scheme assets excluding interest.
The most significant of these is the selection of the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, details of which are set out in note 38.
114 Financial statements Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software Goodwill Goodwill is the difference between the cost of a business acquisition and the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost and is subsequently recognised at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of the acquisition is the amount of cash paid and the fair value of other purchase consideration.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation, and less any accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets comprise renewal rights, customer lists, brands, computer software and other acquired identifiable non-monetary assets without physical form.
The useful economic lives are between one and five years and are estimated considering relevant metrics such as contract length, forecast period to technological obsolescence, and product life cycles.
The asset is amortised on a straight-line basis across this period.
Internally developed computer software The Group capitalises internal and external computer software development costs where the software is separately identifiable: the Group has control over the software: and where it can be demonstrated that they provide future economic benefits for the Group through facilitating revenue or improved processes.
The costs capitalised includes administrative and other general overhead expenditure when they can be directly attributed to the software development and preparing it for use.
The useful economic life of externally acquired and internally generated software is normally estimated to be between three and seven years.
Further information on goodwill and other intangibles can be found in note 23.
Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software Goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis.
Other intangible assets which includes internally generated software are reviewed for indications of impairment on an annual basis and are subject to an impairment test only if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill, other intangible assets and internally developed computer software is allocated to cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
Further information on how the value in use is calculated can be found in note 23.
Where the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount, impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment losses previously recognised on intangible assets may be reversed in subsequent periods provided that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value that would have been determined net of amortisation or depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Assets and liabilities held for sale Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is considered highly probable that the carrying amount of the assets and directly associated liabilities will be recovered principally through a sale, rather than through continuing operations.
This includes the expectation that the sale will be completed within 12 months of the classification date as held for sale.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are each presented as a single line in the statement of financial position, at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Where the asset or liability comprises a separate business operation e. g. a subsidiary, an associate or a branch, the assets including any goodwill allocated to the business and the directly associated liabilities of the business are considered together as one disposal group.
In the period when assets are recognised as held for sale on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position for the first time, the comparative prior period is not re-presented.

It comprises the profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations together with the gain or loss after tax recognised on completed sales or the gain or loss after tax on the discontinued operations arising from revaluing the carrying value of a held for sale operation to its fair value less costs to sell.

Reorganisation costs Reorganisation costs represent external and clearly identifiable internal costs that are necessarily incurred and directly attributable to the Groups restructuring programme.
The aim of the restructuring programme is to both reduce operating costs and improve profitability.
Employee termination costs are only recognised when they are part of a restructuring programme that has been communicated to those affected or when a detailed plan of redundancies is announced.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when action is taken by the Group as part of a restructuring programme that reduces any remaining benefit expected under a contract to below its remaining unavoidable costs.
