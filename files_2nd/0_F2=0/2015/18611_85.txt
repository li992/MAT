The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan comprising awards under a long-term incentive scheme LTIS, adeferred bonus plan DBP, a share incentive plan SIP and a save as you earn SAYE scheme.
For the LTIS awards, one-half are subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance condition measured over three years from the date of grant and one-half are subject to annual growth in NNNAV compared to the average growth in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices all measured over three years from the date of grant.
Awards subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance, which is a market based performance condition, have been valued at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.
Awards subject to growth in NNNAV, which is a non-market based performance condition, have been valued at fair value using aBlack-Scholes valuation model.
Awards granted under the DBP have no specific performance conditions other than the Company meeting its target for operating profit before valuation movements and non-recurring items OPBVM and employees in the scheme continuing to be employed.
There is a three-year vesting period from the date of grant.
One-third of the awards vest at the end of each year.
Participants can choose to exercise their awards on vesting or to retain their awards within the plan until the end of the third year at which point a 50% matching element is added to their award entitlement.
During the year, in addition to the normal DBP scheme, an enhanced DBP scheme EDBP was also provided.
The enhanced scheme operates in exactly the same way as the normal DBP scheme except that if participants retain their awards within the plan until the end of the fifth year, a further additional 50% matching award is added to their award entitlement.
Awards under the DBP EDBP have been valued based on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the vesting period.
Awards under the SAYE scheme have been valued at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Awards under the SIP scheme have been based on the share price at the date of the award.
Shares were awarded, subject to any vesting conditions set out above, to Executive Directors and selected employees during the year under the LTIS.
Share options were granted to employees of the Group during the year in two separate tranches under the SAYE scheme.
The main assumptions used to value the share awards and SAYE options granted during the year are set out in the tables below.
