Financial Statements Financial Statements In this section The financial statements have been presented in a style that attempts to make them less complex and more relevant to shareholders.
We have grouped the note disclosures into five sections: Basis of Preparation, Results for the Year, Operating Assets and Liabilities, Capital Structure and Financing Costs and Other Notes.
Each section sets out the accounting policies applied in producing the relevant notes, along with details of any key judgements and estimates used.
The purpose of this format is to provide readers with a clearer understanding of what drives financial performance of the Group.
The aim of the text in boxes is to provide commentary on each section, or note, in plain English.
Keeping it Notes to the financial statements provide information required by statute, accounting standards simple or Listing Rules to explain a particular feature of the financial statements.
The notes which follow will also provide explanations and additional disclosure to assist readers understanding and interpretation of the Annual Report and the financial statements.
