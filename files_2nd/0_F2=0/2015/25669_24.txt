The pro forma and statutory financial information is presented in pounds sterling and prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The statutory financial statements on a Company-only basis can be found on pages 112 to 119.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation As at 31 December 2014, the Company did not constitute a group as it held only 22.46% of John Laing Holdco Limited formerly Henderson Infrastructure Holdco Limited, the holding company of John Laing Limited formerly John Laing plc.
On 27 January 2015 prior to the Companys Admission in February 2015, a restructuring occurred which included the Company becoming the sole shareholder of John Laing Holdco Limited.
On 17 February 2015, the legal ownership of certain Service Companies in the John Laing Holdco Limited sub-group was transferred to the Company.
Service Companies are explained in note 2c.
The Company was unable to produce group accounts or show financial information in respect of the newly formed group within its statutory results for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Nonetheless, the Directors decided to prepare pro forma financial information for 2014 on the basis that the restructuring described above had occurred on 1 January 2013 and had been in place throughout the year ended 31 December 2014.
In the opinion of the Directors, this information was necessary in order to give a true and fair view of the Companys affairs.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, there is no difference between the pro forma and statutory balance sheets as at 31 December 2015.
However, there is a difference in the income statement relating to the 27 day period between 1 January 2015 and 27 January 2015 when the Company only owned 22.46% of the John Laing Holdco Limited group the Company acquired the remaining 77.54% of the John Laing Holdco Limited group on 27 January 2015.
The difference primarily relates to the deficit on the Groups pension schemes, held at the time in the John Laing Holdco Limited sub-group, at 27 January 2015 compared to 1 January 2015, due to an adverse movement in discount rates between these dates.
Pro forma and statutory information has therefore both been presented in the Group Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2015.
This is the last year for which pro forma financial information will be presented.
The financial statements have been prepared on an investment entity basis see note 2c and in accordance with the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of the investment portfolio and financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies.
