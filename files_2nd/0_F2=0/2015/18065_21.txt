EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS Exceptional items are those items that are of a non-recurring nature and, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence.
Items which may be considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, business restructurings, significant onerous contract charges and asset write-downs.

The Group recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of 1,865 million post-tax charge 1,396 million in the Centrica Energy Gas segment, which included a pre-tax impairment charge of 42 million post-tax charge 38 million on the Trinidad and Tobago gas assets, a pre-tax impairment charge of 1,514 million post-tax charge 1,082 million on UK, Dutch and Norwegian gas and oil assets including 510 million of goodwill and a pre-tax impairment charge of 309 million post-tax charge 276 million on Canadian upstream assets including 99 million of goodwill.
Further details on how the recoverable amounts of fields are calculated on a fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD basis are provided below.
The impairment charge for UK, Dutch and Norwegian gas assets is net of reversals of previous impairments totalling 16 million post-tax credit 7 million following revisions to decommissioning estimates.
ii A pre-tax impairment charge of 31 million post-tax charge of 31 million has been recognised in the Centrica Energy Power segment in relation to its finance leased UK gas-fired power station, predominantly due to declining forecast capacity market auction prices and clean spark spread prices.
A further 70 million charge post-tax charge of 70 million was recognised as an onerous power procurement contract for further unavoidable costs under this tolling contract for this UK gas-fired power station.
A further onerous contract provision charge for the Direct Energy wind power procurement arrangement of 20 million post-tax charge of 12 million was also recognised.
Further details on how the recoverable amount of the assets is calculated on a VIU basis are provided below.
iii The Group recognised an impairment charge of 372 million post-tax charge of 372 million on its Nuclear investment within the Centrica Energy Power segment due to declining forecast power prices and capacity market auction prices.
Further details on how the recoverable amount of the investment is calculated on a FVLCD basis are provided below.
iv The Group recognised a re-measurement of 81 million on deferred tax assets related to Investment Allowances for its exploration and production assets that are no longer expected to be recoverable against future taxable profits due to declining gas and oil prices.
v During the period, the UK supplementary charge was reduced from 32% to 20%, with effect from 1 January 2015 and the petroleum revenue tax PRT rate was reduced from 50% to 35% with effect from 1 January 2016.
These changes have been substantively enacted by the reporting date and the reduction in net deferred tax liabilities has been recognised immediately as an exceptional tax credit.
Certain re-measurements are the fair value movements on energy contracts entered into to meet the future needs of our customers or to sell the energy produced from our upstream assets.
These contracts are economically related to our upstream assets, capacity offtake contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued, and are therefore separately identified in the current period and reflected in business performance in future periods when the underlying transaction or asset impacts the Group Income Statement.
b Certain re-measurements 2015 2014 Year ended 31 December m m Certain re-measurements recognised in relation to energy contracts note 2 : Net gains losses arising on delivery of contracts 973 63 Net losses arising on market price movements and new contracts 857 1,071 Net re-measurements included within gross profit 116 1,134 Net losses gains arising on re-measurement of associates energy contracts net of taxation 13 26 Net re-measurements included within Group operating loss 103 1,108 i Taxation on certain re-measurements note 9 26 337 Net re-measurements after taxation 129 771 i Includes 20 million gain 2014: nil due to the effect of change in UK tax rates.
The Group is generally a net buyer of commodity: procuring gas and power for our customers.
Following significant decreases in commodity prices, net losses arising on market price movements and new contracts of 857 million 2014: 1,071 million have been recorded.
c Impairment accounting policy, process and sensitivities The Group reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill, PP&E and intangible assets with the exception of exploration assets see note S2 annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amounts may be lower than their carrying amounts.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such an indicator arises.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of VIU and FVLCD.
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 106 F FINANC INANCIIAL S AL ST TA A T T E E M M E EN NTS TS N N O O TTE ES T S T O T O TH HE F EI F NIA NANC NCIAL S IAL TA ST TE ATEMEN MENTS TS 106 Notes to the Financial Statements 7.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS At inception, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs or groups of CGUs that expect to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is expensed immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any CGU impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
VIU calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all CGUs that include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances with the exception of the impairment tests for the Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil CGUs, where FVLCD has been used.
This methodology is deemed to be more appropriate for these CGUs as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the underlying assets and is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets.
Subsequently, the specific, underlying Upstream gas and oil PP&E assets and, in addition, the Groups associate investment in Nuclear and the Storage PP&E assets have also used the FVLCD impairment methodology.
UK power generation assets have used the VIU impairment methodology.
Further details of the approach and assumptions used in the VIU calculations are provided in note S2.
FVLCD discount rate and cash-flow assumptions Centrica Energy Gas Upstream gas and oil production An impairment charge of 1,865 million 2014: 1,189 million has been recorded within exceptional items for Centrica Energy exploration and production assets.
The associated recoverable amounts net of decommissioning costs of 1,049 million are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
FVLCD is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas and oil production and development assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period.
Where forward market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
Note S6 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and liquids produced.
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field are computed using individual economic models.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculation for the first three years are based on the Groups Boardapproved three-year business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts, which management believes reflects the assumptions of a market participant.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 9% 2014: 9% to determine the FVLCD.
The discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCD calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations described in note S2, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
The valuation of Centrica Energy Gas goodwill is particularly sensitive to the price assumptions made in the impairment calculations.
To illustrate this, the price assumptions for gas and oil have been varied by 10%.
Changes in price generate different production profiles and in some cases the date that an asset ceases production.
This has been considered in the sensitivity analysis.
Otherwise, all other operating costs, life of field capital expenditure and abandonment expenditure assumptions remain unchanged.
For exploration and production assets, an increase in gas and oil prices of 10% would reverse 327 million 2014: 142 million of post-tax impairment charges of the underlying exploration and production assets.
A reduction of 10% would give rise to further post-tax impairments of the underlying exploration and production assets of 245 million 2014: 254 million and a further post-tax impairment of goodwill of 238 million 2014: 251 million in the UK Norway Netherlands CGU.
Centrica Energy Power Nuclear An impairment charge of 372 million 2014: 214 million has been recorded within exceptional items for the Groups associate investment in Nuclear.
FVLCD is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the investment, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of the underlying nuclear power stations, planned and unplanned outage assumptions, operating cost assumptions and forward prices for power and forecast capacity market auction prices.
Note S6 provides additional detail of the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCD calculations for the first three years are based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 8% 2014: 8% to determine the FVLCD.
The valuation of the Groups investment in Nuclear, which is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is particularly sensitive to assumptions variations in the power price.
To illustrate this, sensitivities were performed at the year end to vary the power price assumptions in the Groups internal valuation model by 10%.
An increase in power prices of 10%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, would result in the reversal of the impairment of 372 million 2014: 214 million recorded at the year end and would potentially reverse 81 million of the prior year impairment 2014: provide headroom of 310 million.
A reduction of 10% would give rise to a further impairment charge of 436 million 2014: 522 million.
Storage No impairment charge has been recognised for the Groups gas storage assets 2014: nil.
However, there is limited headroom on the current impairment test.
The impairment test is particularly sensitive to assumptions variations in seasonal gas price spreads and to the resolution of the limitation of the maximum operating pressure of the storage asset.
To illustrate the impact of price on the impairment analysis, sensitivities were performed at the year end to vary the gas spreads by -10%.
An increase in gas spreads of 10%, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, increases the headroom to 116 million.
A reduction of 10% would give rise to an impairment of 76 million.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN RE-MEASUREMENTS A change in the assumptions of the timing and extent of the return to maximum operating pressure could also significantly impact the impairment calculation and could result in a significant impairment in certain adverse scenarios.
The current value of the Groups gas storage fixed assets is 511 million 260 million, net of the decommissioning provision and deferred tax.
VIU discount rate and cash-flow assumptions Centrica Energy Power Upstream Power An impairment charge of 31 million 2014: 535 million has been recorded within exceptional items for the UK gas-fired power stations with a further 70 million charge for an onerous power procurement contract provision.
Since the unavoidable costs under this tolling contract exceed the recoverable amounts, the remaining fixed asset has been impaired.
In 2014, the recoverable amounts were determined using VIU calculations, with future cash flows discounted using a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 7.4%.
Cash inflows were based on forecast production profiles, forward prices for power, gas and carbon and forecast capacity market auction prices.
Where forward market prices were not available, prices were determined based on internal model inputs.
Cash outflows for operating and capital expenditure were based, for the first three years, on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans and, thereafter, were based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
The calculation of the related onerous power station tolling contract is based on the same assumptions using a pre-tax nominal discount rate of 2.0%.
NET FINANCE COST Financing costs mainly comprise interest on bonds, bank debt and commercial paper, the results of hedging activities used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate movements on the Groups borrowings, and notional interest arising on discounting of decommissioning provisions.
An element of financing cost is capitalised on qualifying projects.
Investment income predominantly includes interest received on short-term investments in money market funds, bank deposits, government bonds and notional interest on pensions.

TAXATION The taxation note details the different tax charges and rates, including current and deferred tax arising in the Group.
The current tax charge is the tax payable on this years taxable profits.
This tax charge excludes taxation on the Groups share of results of joint ventures and associates.
Deferred tax represents the tax on differences between the accounting carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
These differences are temporary and are expected to unwind in the future.

The consequential reduction in net deferred tax liabilities has been recognised within exceptional items, and includes a petroleum revenue tax charge of 33 million 2014: nil.
iii Total tax on loss excludes taxation on the Groups share of profits of joint ventures and associates.
Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note S4.
The Group earns the majority of its profits in the UK.
Most activities in the UK are subject to the standard rate for UK corporation tax, which from 1 April 2015 was 20% 2014: 21%.
Upstream oil and gas production activities are taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2014: 30% plus a supplementary charge of 20% 2014: 32% to give an overall rate of 50% 2014: 62%.
In addition, certain upstream assets in the UK attract petroleum revenue tax PRT at 50% 2014: 50% which is deductible against corporation tax, giving an overall effective rate of 75% 2014: 81%.
Norwegian upstream profits are taxed at the standard rate of 27% 2014: 27% plus a special tax of 51% 2014: 51% resulting in an aggregate tax rate of 78% 2014: 78%.
Profits earned in the US are taxed at a Federal rate of 35% 2014: 35% together with state taxes at various rates dependent on the state.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.
On 26 October 2015, the UK Government substantively enacted Finance No.
2 Act 2015 which included reductions in the main UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
At 31 December 2015, the relevant UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included in these Financial Statements were based on the reduced rates having regard to their reversal profiles.
On 26 March 2015, the UK Government enacted Finance Act 2015 which included a reduction in the PRT rate to 35% from 1 January 2016.
Deferred PRT assets and liabilities were based on the reduced rate.

ii Changes to tax rates on exceptional items and certain re-measurements includes a petroleum revenue tax charge of 33 million 2014: nil.
c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Groups effective tax rates are impacted by changes to the mix of activities and production across the territories in which it operates.
Effective tax rates may also fluctuate where profits and losses cannot be offset for tax purposes.
The Groups UK profits earned away from gas and oil production will benefit from reduced rates of corporation tax in 2017 and beyond 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020.
UK gas and oil production profits will benefit from a 15 percentage point reduction to PRT from 1 January 2016.
Profits from oil and gas production in the UK continue to be taxed at rates above the UK statutory rate and PRT will continue to be applied to certain upstream profits.
The PRT borne is expected to decrease as production activity in the relevant fields declines over time.
Income earned in territories outside the UK, notably in the US and Norway, is generally subject to higher effective rates of tax than the current UK statutory rate.
In the medium term, the Groups effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate.

TAXATION d Relationship between current tax charge and taxes paid UK Non-UK 2015 UK Non-UK 2014 Year ended 31 December m m m m m m Current tax charge: Corporation tax 110 230 340 100 362 462 Petroleum revenue tax 30 30 53 53 140 230 370 153 362 515 Taxes paid: Corporation tax 130 228 358 116 435 551 Petroleum revenue tax 9 9 156 156 121 228 349 272 435 707 Differences between current tax charged and taxes paid arose principally due to the following factors: corporation tax payments are generally based on estimated profits, partly during the year and partly in the following year and cash tax balancing on agreement with tax authorities will also occur in future periods.
Fluctuations in profits from year to year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the current year and taxes paid: and PRT payments are based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual profits.
Variations in production from period to period may therefore lead to temporary differences between the tax charged and the tax paid.
EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Earnings per share EPS is the amount of profit or loss attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is the amount of profit or loss for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS includes the impact of outstanding share options.
Basic loss per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 747 million 2014: 1,012 million loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 5,011 million 2014: 5,022 million.
The number of shares excludes 72 million ordinary shares 2014: 82 million, being the weighted average number of the Companys own shares held in the employee share trust and treasury shares purchased by the Group as part of the share repurchase programme.
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for certain re-measurements and exceptional items assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group, as explained in note 2.
14 In 2014, the Group purchased 132.1 million ordinary shares of 6 pence each.
These shares represented 2.6% of the called up share 81 capital as at 31 December 2014 and were purchased at an average price of 3.18 per share for a total consideration including expenses of 422 million.
These shares were purchased as part of the 420 million share repurchase programme announced on 18 December 2013: they are held as treasury shares and are deducted from equity unless they are cancelled see note S4.
No such shares were purchased in 2015.
In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported loss for either 2015 or 2014, however, the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Weighted average number of shares 2015 2014 Million Million Year ended 31 December shares shares Weighted average number of shares basic 5,011 5,022 i Dilutive impact of share-based payment schemes 38 27 Weighted average number of shares diluted 5,049 5,049 i The dilutive impact of share-based payment schemes is included in the calculation of diluted EPS, unless it has the effect of increasing the profit or decreasing the loss attributable to each share.
Therefore, these shares are excluded from the calculation of basic diluted EPS in 2015 and 2014.

DIVIDENDS Dividends represent the cash return of profits to shareholders and are paid twice a year, in June and November.
Dividends are paid as an amount per ordinary share held.

The dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 18 April 2016 and, subject to approval, will be paid on 23 June 2016 to those shareholders registered on 13 May 2016.
On 19 February 2015, the Company announced its intention to offer a scrip dividend alternative to its shareholders commencing with the final 2014 dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014.
176 million of the 418 million prior year final dividend was in the form of ordinary shares to shareholders opting in to the scrip dividend alternative.
The market value per share at the date of payment was 2.57 per share resulting in the issue of 68 million new shares and 171 million being credited to the share premium account.
Similarly 34 million of the 180 million interim dividend was taken as a scrip dividend.
The market value per share at 26 November 2015 was 2.28 resulting in the issue of 15 million new shares and 33 million of share premium.
Despite the consolidated Groups retained earnings being 482 million, the Group still has sufficient distributable reserves to pay dividends to its ultimate shareholders.
Distributable reserves are calculated on an individual legal entity basis and the ultimate parent company, Centrica plc, currently has adequate levels of realised profits within its retained earnings to support dividend payments.
Refer to the Centrica plc Company Balance Sheet on page 170.
On an annual basis, the distributable reserve levels of the Groups subsidiary undertakings are reviewed and dividends paid up the ownership chain to replenish Centrica plcs reserve levels.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL The Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets.
Goodwill, customer relationships and brands arise when we acquire a business.
Goodwill is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies, growth opportunities and technical goodwill from items such as deferred tax.
Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed for recoverability each year.
The Group uses European Union Allowances EUAs and Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs to satisfy its related obligations.
Upstream exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset until development of the asset commences, at which point it is transferred to PP&E or is deemed to not be commercially viable and is written down.
ii The 2 million EUAs and ROCs acquisition relates to a fair value adjustment in respect of a prior year business combination.
iii Included within application software disposals retirements and surrenders are 286 million of gross assets which have been retired and have a net book value of zero.
iv Transfers to from other balance sheet accounts, primarily PP&E.

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future as a result of differences in the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Forecasts indicate that there will be suitable taxable profits to utilise those deferred tax assets not offset against deferred tax liabilities.
Specific legislative provisions applicable to oil and gas production provide assurance that deferred tax assets relating to decommissioning costs and certain trading losses will be utilised.
At the balance sheet date the Group had certain unrecognised deductible temporary differences of 963 million 2014: 881 million, of which 790 million 2014: 266 million are carried forward tax losses available for utilisation against future taxable profits.
Some 118 million 2014: 127 million of these losses will expire within one to five years.
All other temporary differences have no expiry date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the balance sheet date, no taxable temporary differences existed in respect of the Groups overseas investments 2014: nil.
The deferred tax liability arising on these temporary differences is estimated to be nil 2014: nil.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of expected default and loss factors, informed by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable from residential and business customers on a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts.
Balances are written off when recoverability is assessed as being remote.
The impairment charge in trade receivables is stated net of credits for the release of specific provisions made in previous years, which are no longer required.
These relate primarily to residential customers in the UK.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage the risk arising from fluctuations in the value of certain assets or liabilities, associated with treasury management, energy sales and procurement.
These derivatives are held at fair value, and are predominantly unrealised positions, expected to unwind in future periods.
The Group also uses derivatives for proprietary energy trading purposes.
Purpose Accounting treatment Proprietary energy trading Carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the Groups results for the year, before i and treasury management exceptional items and certain re-measurements ii Energy procurement Carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in certain re-measurements optimisation i With the exception of certain energy derivatives related to cross-border transportation and capacity contracts.
ii Energy contracts designated at fair value through profit or loss include certain energy contracts that the Group has, at its option, designated at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39 because the energy contract contains one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows under the contract note S2.
In cases where a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, derivatives are classified as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Note S5 provides further detail on the Groups hedge accounting.

The Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme CEPS, Centrica Pension Plan CPP and Centrica Pension Scheme CPS form the significant majority of the Groups defined benefit obligation and are referred to below as the Registered Pension Schemes.
The other schemes are individually, and in aggregate, immaterial.
Independent valuations The Registered Pension Schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employer contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The latest full actuarial valuations for the Registered Pension Schemes based on the position at 31 March 2015 are in progress, however the underlying information has been updated to 31 December 2015 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19: Employee Benefits 2011.
The latest full actuarial valuation for the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan was carried out at 1 August 2014 and has also been updated to 31 December 2015 for the purpose of meeting the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments held in all schemes have been valued for this purpose at market value.
Governance The Registered Pension Schemes are managed by trustee companies whose boards consist of both company-nominated and membernominated Directors.
Each scheme holds units in the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund CCCIF, which holds the majority of the combined assets of the Registered Pension Schemes.
The board of the CCCIF is currently comprised of nine Directors: three independent Directors, three Directors appointed by Centrica plc including the Chairman and one Director appointed by each of the three Registered Pension Schemes.
Under the terms of the Pensions Act 2004, Centrica plc and each trustee board must agree the funding rate for its defined benefit pension scheme and a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme-specific statutory funding objective.
This approach was first adopted for the triennial valuations completed at 31 March 2006, and has been reflected in subsequent valuations, including the 31 March 2015 valuations.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS b Risks The Registered Pension Schemes expose the Group to the following risks: Asset volatility The pension liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to AA corporate bond yields: if the growth in plan assets is lower than this, this will create an actuarial loss within other equity.
The CCCIF is responsible for managing the assets of each scheme in line with the liability-related investment objectives that have been set by the trustees of the schemes, and invests in a diversified portfolio of assets.
The schemes are relatively young in nature the schemes opened in 1997 on the formation of Centrica plc on demerger from BG plc formerly British Gas plc, and only took on liabilities in respect of active employees.
Therefore, the CCCIF holds a significant proportion of return-seeking assets: such assets are generally expected to provide a higher return than corporate bonds, but result in greater exposure to volatility and risk in the short term.
The investment objectives are to achieve a target return above a return based on a portfolio of gilts, subject to a maximum volatility ceiling.
If there have been advantageous asset movements relative to liabilities above a set threshold, then fide-risking is undertaken, and as a consequence the return target and maximum volatility ceiling are reduced.
Interest rate A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the net present value of the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that the duration of the liabilities is longer than average for typical UK pension schemes, resulting in a relatively higher exposure to interest rate risk.
Inflation Pensions in deferment, pensions in payment and pensions accrued under the career average schemes increase in line with the Retail Price Index RPI and the Consumer Price Index CPI.
Therefore scheme liabilities will increase if inflation is higher than assumed, although in some cases caps are in place to limit the impact of significant movements in inflation.
During the year the Group offered a pension increase exchange PIE to future retirees within the Registered Pension Schemes.
This PIE gives the option to receive a higher initial pension in return for giving up certain future increases linked to RPI.
This has resulted in a past service credit of 38 million in the year.
Longevity The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of scheme members and their surviving spouses: therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the pension liabilities.
The relative immaturity of the schemes means that there is comparatively little observable mortality data to assess the rates of mortality experienced by the schemes, and means that the schemes liabilities will be paid over a long period of time, making it particularly difficult to predict the life expectancy of the current membership.
Furthermore, pension payments are subject to inflationary increases, resulting in a higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
Salary For final salary schemes, the pension liabilities are calculated by reference to the future salaries of active members, and hence salary rises in excess of assumed increases will increase scheme liabilities.
During 2011 changes were introduced to the final salary sections of CEPS and CPP such that annual increases in pensionable pay are capped to 2%, resulting in a reduction in salary risk.
Foreign exchange Certain of the assets held by the CCCIF are denominated in foreign currencies, and hence their values are subject to exchange rate risk.
The CCCIF has long-term hedging programmes in place to manage interest rate, inflation and foreign exchange risks.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS c Accounting assumptions The accounting assumptions for the Registered Pension Schemes have been given below: Major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation 2015 2014 31 December % % Rate of increase in employee earnings: Subject to cap 1.7 1.7 Other 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions: In line with CPI capped at 2.5% 1.9 1.9 In line with RPI 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 3.9 3.9 The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination of standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
The longevity assumptions for members in normal health are as follows: 2015 2014 Life expectancy at age 65 for a member Male Female Male Female 31 December Years Years Years Years Currently aged 65 23.4 25.1 22.7 25.1 Currently aged 45 25.1 27.0 24.4 27.0 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuations of the pension schemes.
Reasonably possible changes as at 31 December to one of the actuarial assumptions would have affected the scheme liabilities as set out below: 2015 2014 Impact of changing material assumptions Indicative effect Indicative effect Increase on scheme Increase on scheme decrease in liabilities decrease in liabilities 31 December assumption % assumption % Rate of increase in employee earnings subject to cap 0.25% 1 0.25% 1 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 0.25% 4 0.25% 5 Discount rate 0.25% 6 0.25% 6 Inflation assumption 0.25% 4 0.25% 5 Longevity assumption 1 year 3 1 year 3 The indicative effects on scheme liabilities have been calculated by changing each assumption in isolation and assessing the impact on the liabilities.
For the reasonably possible change in the inflation assumption, it has been assumed that a change to the inflation assumption would lead to corresponding changes in the assumed rates of increase in uncapped pensionable pay, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
The remaining disclosures in this note cover all of the Groups defined benefit schemes.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS Included within equities are 1 million 2014: 2 million of ordinary shares of Centrica plc via pooled funds that include a benchmark allocation to UK equities.
Included within corporate bonds are 2 million 2014: 3 million of bonds issued by Centrica plc held within pooled funds over which the CCCIF has no ability to direct investment decisions.
Apart from the investment in the Scottish Limited Partnerships described in note 22 g, no direct investments are made in securities issued by Centrica plc or any of its subsidiaries or property leased to or owned by Centrica plc or any of its subsidiaries.
Included within the Group Balance Sheet within non-current securities are 76 million 2014: 75 million of investments, held in trust on behalf of the Group, as security in respect of the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme.
Of the pension scheme liabilities above, 50 million 2014: 49 million relate to this scheme.
More information on the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme is included in the Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 79. g Pension scheme contributions Based on the triennial valuations at 31 March 2012, the Group and the trustees of the Registered Pension Schemes agreed to fund the scheduled deficit payments using asset-backed contribution arrangements.
Under the arrangements, certain loans to UK Group companies were transferred to Scottish Limited Partnerships established by the Group.
During 2012 and 2013 the Group made special contributions to the Registered Pension Schemes of 444 million, which the schemes immediately used to acquire interests in the partnerships for their fair value of 444 million.
The schemes total partnership interests entitle them to distributions from the income of the partnerships over a period of between four and 15 years.
Until 2016 this income will amount to 77 million per annum but will reduce thereafter.
The partnerships are controlled by Centrica and their results are consolidated by the Group.
As the trustees interests in the partnerships do not meet the definition of a plan asset under IAS 19, they are not reflected in the Group Balance Sheet.
Distributions from the partnerships to the schemes will be recognised as scheme assets in the future as they occur.
Although there is a relatively small IAS 19 accounting deficit in the Registered Pension Schemes in comparison with the defined benefit obligation, the pension trustees are required to calculate the funding position on a more prudent Technical Provisions basis.
The next triennial review based on the position as at 31 March 2015 is in progress and because government bond yields are currently low this is likely to result in a Technical Provisions deficit in the Registered Pension Schemes.
It is likely, therefore, that additional deficit payments will be required following the completion of the triennial valuation.
Deficit payments are also being made in respect of the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan in Canada.
1 million was paid in the year to 31 December 2015.
The Group estimates that it will pay 98 million of ordinary employer contributions during 2016 at an average rate of 21% of pensionable pay, together with 25 million of contributions paid via the salary sacrifice arrangement.
At 31 March 2015 the date of the latest full actuarial valuations the weighted average duration of the liabilities of the Registered Pension Schemes was 24 years.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a Commitments Commitments are not held on the Groups Balance Sheet as these are executory arrangements, and relate to amounts that we are contractually required to pay in the future as long as the other party meets its contractual obligations.
The Group procures commodities through a mixture of production from gas fields, power stations, wind farms and procurement contracts.
Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices.
They also include gas and electricity contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.
The commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts disclosed below are stated net of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts, where there is a right of offset with the counterparty.
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
The commitments disclosed below are based on the minimum quantities of gas and other commodities that the Group is contracted to buy at estimated future prices.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The commitments in this note differ in scope and in basis from the maturity analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note S3.
Whilst the commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts include all purchase contracts, only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in note S3.
In addition, the volumes used in calculating the maturity analysis in note S3 are estimated using valuation techniques, rather than being based on minimum contractual quantities.
On 25 March 2013, the Group and Company announced that it had entered into a 20-year agreement with Cheniere to purchase 89bcf per annum of LNG volumes for export from the Sabine Pass liquefaction plant in the US, subject to a number of project milestones and regulatory approvals being achieved.
During 2015 Cheniere made a positive final investment decision on the fifth project at Sabine Pass following receipt of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and a Non-Free Trade Agreement licence from the Department of Energy.
Under the terms of the agreement with Cheniere, the Group is committed to make capacity payments of up to 3.8 billion included in LNG capacity below between 2018 and 2038.
The Group may also make up to 6 billion of commodity purchases based on market gas prices and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date.
The target date for first commercial delivery is estimated by the terminal operator as Q4 2018.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At 31 December the maturity analyses for commodity purchase contract commitments and the total minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases were: Total minimum lease Commodity payments under purchase contract non-cancellable commitments operating leases 2015 2014 2015 2014 31 December billion billion m m 1 year 9.1 10.4 121 154 12 years 5.0 6.4 82 117 23 years 3.4 3.3 73 79 34 years 2.9 3.0 66 60 45 years 3.6 2.2 58 50 5 years 19.5 14.3 370 350 43.5 39.6 770 810 Operating lease payments recognised as an expense in the year were as follows: 2015 2014 Year ended 31 December m m Minimum lease payments net of sub-lease receipts 125 113 i Contingent rents renewables 75 98 i The Group has entered into long-term arrangements with renewable providers to purchase physical power, renewable obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates from renewable sources.
Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and so there is no commitment to a minimum lease payment 2014: nil.
Payments made for physical power are charged to the Group Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents.
b Guarantees and indemnities This section discloses any guarantees and indemnities that the Group has given, where we may have to provide security in the future against existing and future obligations that will remain for a specific period.
In connection with the Groups energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay, provide credit support or provide other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in creditworthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
The Group has provided a number of guarantees and indemnities in respect of decommissioning costs: the most significant indemnities relate to the decommissioning costs associated with the Morecambe, Statfjord and Kvitebjorn fields.
These indemnities are to the previous owners of these fields.
Under the licence conditions of the fields, the previous owners will have exposure to the decommissioning costs should these liabilities not be fully discharged by the Group.
With regard to Morecambe the security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the associated gas field falls below a predetermined proportion of the estimated decommissioning cost.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant legal decommissioning notices in respect of the relevant fields have been revoked.
Following legislation having been executed, the UK Government has now signed contracts Decommissioning Relief Deeds DRDs with industry, providing certainty on decommissioning tax relief through confirmation of allowance against previous taxable profits.
These deeds permit industry to move to post-tax Decommissioning Security Agreements DSAs, cutting the cost of these and freeing up capital for investment.
Centrica has a signed DRD and discussions are ongoing with the relevant counterparty to move to a post-tax DSA for Morecambe.
Security for Statfjord and Kvitebjorn is slightly different in this respect as it was provided to the previous owners as part of the acquisition of these fields.
c Contingent liabilities On 13 June 2013, the Group acquired a 25% interest in the Bowland exploration licenses in Lancashire from Cuadrilla Resources Ltd and AJ Lucas Group Ltd for 44 million in cash.
During the year, the Group renegotiated the commercial terms around the carry and contingent payment obligations agreed at acquisition.
The Group may now be required to pay 32 million of additional costs related to exploration activities under a carry agreement which is contingent on planning consents being received.
Following the completion of these exploration activities, the Group would pay additional costs of 35 million under a further carry agreement if the Group elects to continue into the development phase.
There are no other material contingent liabilities.

SOURCES OF FINANCE a Capital structure The Group seeks to maintain an efficient capital structure with a balance of debt and equity as shown in the table below: 2015 2014 31 December m m Net debt 4,747 5,196 Equity 1,178 2,735 Capital 5,925 7,931 Debt levels are restricted to limit the risk of financial distress and, in particular, to maintain a strong credit profile.
The Groups credit standing is important for several reasons: to maintain a low cost of debt, limit collateral requirements in energy trading, hedging and decommissioning security arrangements, and to ensure the Group is an attractive counterparty to energy producers and long-term customers.
The Group monitors its current and projected capital position on a regular basis, considering a medium-term view of three to five years, and different stress case scenarios, including the impact of changes in the Groups credit ratings and significant movements in commodity prices.
A number of financial ratios are monitored: including those used by the credit rating agencies, such as debt to cash flow ratios and adjusted EBITDA to gross interest expense.
At 31 December 2015, the ratio of the Groups net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.0 2014: 1.8.
Adjusted EBITDA to gross interest expense for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 7.2 2014: 8.8.
British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL is required under PRA regulations to hold a minimum capital amount and has complied with this requirement in 2015 and 2014.
The Companys Articles of Association limit the Groups borrowings to the greater of 5.0 billion and three times adjusted capital and reserves.
At the year end, the Group has undertaken impairment tests on its long-lived assets and, predominantly as a result of significant adverse commodity price movements, has recognised asset impairments of 2.3 billion.
These impairments are the primary driver of the reduction in the Groups adjusted capital and reserves as defined by the Companys Articles of Association to 1.2 billion 2014: 2.7 billion, and will consequently reduce the Groups borrowings limit under the Companys Articles of Association to 5.0 billion 2014: 8.2 billion from the date of audit of these Financial Statements until shareholders approve the suspension or raising of that limit, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 18 April 2016.
This restriction has been taken into account when the Directors have considered the Groups ongoing ability to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group funds its long-term debt requirements through issuing bonds in capital markets and entering into bank debt.
Short-term debt requirements are met primarily through the issuance of commercial paper.
The Group maintains substantial committed facilities and uses these to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including short-term business requirements and back-up for commercial paper.
b Liquidity risk management and going concern The Group has a number of treasury and risk policies to monitor and manage liquidity risk.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios, including, but not limited to, reasonably possible increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a credit rating downgrade.
The Group seeks to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
It is the Groups policy to maintain committed facilities and or available surplus cash resources of at least 1,200 million, raise at least 75% of its net debt excluding non-recourse debt in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse longterm debt portfolio greater than five years.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had undrawn committed credit facilities of 4,379 million 2014: 3,751 million and 637 million 2014: 374 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.
136% 2014: 112% of the Groups net debt has been raised in the long-term debt market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 12.0 years 2014: 12.8 years.
The Groups liquidity is impacted by the cash posted or received under margin and collateral agreements.
The terms and conditions of these depend on the counterparty and the specific details of the transaction.
Cash is generally returned to the Group or by the Group within two days of trade settlement.
Refer to note 24 c for movement in cash posted or received as collateral.
In the preparation of the 2015 Financial Statements, the Group has further evaluated its liquidity position taking into account any limitation on borrowings arising from the Companys Articles of Association.
The analysis includes cash resources available at the time of signing the Financial Statements and takes into account the remote scenario of restrictions continuing after the Companys AGM.
The relatively high level of undrawn committed bank facilities and available cash resources has enabled the Directors to conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
The statement of going concern is included in the Directors Report Governance, on page 62.

ii Collateral is posted or received to support energy trading and procurement activities.
It is posted when contracts with marginable counterparties are out of the money and is received when contracts are in the money.
These positions reverse when contracts are settled and the collateral is returned.
Of the net cash collateral posted at the year end, 74 million 2014: 185 million is included within trade payables, 216 million 2014: 961 million within trade receivables, and 393 million 2014: nil has been offset against net derivative financial liabilities.
The items, to which the cash posted or received as collateral under margin and collateral agreements relate are not included within net debt.
iii Securities balances include 124 million 2014: 129 million of index-linked gilts which the Group uses for short-term liquidity management purposes and 120 million of available-for-sale financial assets 2014: 86 million.
The Group has posted 28 million 2014: 29 million of non-current securities as collateral against an index-linked swap maturing on 16 April 2020. iv In 2014, a 30 million deposit with Societe Generale in relation to a rolling credit facility was included within this category.
The deposit was classified as an other receivable see note 17 but the matching loan was included in borrowings.
In 2015 the principal was repaid and the deposit released.
Borrowings in 2015 are therefore not net of related deposits.

EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE The Group updates disclosures in light of new information being received, or a significant event occurring, in the period between 31 December 2015 and the date of this report.
Disposal On 5 February 2016, Centrica and its 50% joint venture partner announced the joint sale of the Glens of Foudland, Lynn and Inner Dowsing GLID wind farms.
After repayment of debt associated with GLID and other costs, Centricas net share of the sales proceeds will be approximately 115 million, which exceeds the carrying value of the disposed assets.
The sale is in line with Centricas strategy to dispose of its interests in wind power generation.
Centrica will continue to purchase 100% of the power and 50% of the ROCs from the three wind farms under existing power purchase agreements until 2024.
As at 31 December 2015, management considered that the disposal group did not meet the IFRS 5: Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations criteria to be classified as held for sale.
A sale was not considered to be highly probable within one year.
Although plans to sell the disposal group had been announced and negotiations with buyers had commenced, there was significant uncertainty at the balance sheet date as to whether a sale could be completed in its present condition, given the complex and unique nature of the deal being proposed for an offshore wind farm asset.
Dividends The Directors propose a final dividend of 8.43 pence per ordinary share totalling 427 million for the year ended 31 December 2015.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES This section sets out the Groups significant accounting policies in addition to the critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated Financial Statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to the years presented.
Income Statement presentation The Group Income Statement and segmental note separately identify the effects of re-measurement of certain financial instruments, and items that are exceptional, in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying performance, as described below.
Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company.
Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
Control is exercised over an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Transactions with non-controlling interests that relate to their ownership interests and do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition at which point the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3, and applies the acquisition method to account for the transaction as a business combination or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to align the accounting policies with those used by the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset.
Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and regularly reviewed by the Groups Executive Committee for the purposes of evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue includes amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Energy supply: revenue is recognised on the basis of energy supplied during the year.
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end unread.
Unread gas and electricity is estimated using historical consumption patterns, taking into account the industry reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and is included in accrued energy income within trade and other receivables.
Proprietary energy trading: revenue comprises both realised settled and unrealised fair value changes net gains and losses from trading in physical and financial energy contracts.
Fixed-fee service and insurance contracts: revenue from these contracts is recognised in the Group Income Statement with regard to the incidence of risk over the life of the contract, reflecting the seasonal propensity of claims to be made under the contracts and the benefits receivable by the customer, which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term.
Amounts paid in advance are treated as deferred income, with any amount in arrears recognised as accrued income.
For one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised at the date of service provision.
Storage services: storage capacity revenues are recognised evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for the injection and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities.
Gas purchases and gas sales transactions entered into to optimise the performance of the gas storage facilities are presented net within revenue.
Cushion gas sales revenue is recognised when the gas is transferred to the customer account or sold to the market.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Upstream production: revenue associated with exploration and production sales of natural gas, crude oil and condensates is recognised when title passes to the customer.
Revenue from the production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the Group has an interest with other producers is recognised based on the Groups working interest and the terms of the relevant production sharing arrangements the entitlement method.
Where differences arise between production sold and the Groups share of production, this is accounted for as an overlift or underlift see separate accounting policy.
Purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of production facilities are presented net within revenue.
Power generation: revenue is recognised on the basis of power supplied during the period.
Power purchases and sales entered into to optimise the performance of power generation facilities are presented net within revenue.
Cost of sales Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced and purchased during the year taking into account the industry reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and bought-in materials and services.
Cost of sales relating to fixed-fee service and insurance contracts includes direct labour and related overheads on installation work, repairs and service contracts in the year.
Cost of sales relating to gas and oil production includes depreciation of assets used in production of gas and oil, royalty costs and direct labour costs.
Cost of sales within power generation businesses includes the depreciation of assets included in generating power, fuel purchase costs, direct labour costs and carbon emissions costs.
Investment income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying value.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that arise in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised and subsequently amortised in line with the depreciation of the related asset.
Borrowing costs are capitalised from the time of acquisition or from the beginning of construction or production until the point at which the qualifying asset is ready for use.
Where a specific financing arrangement is in place, the specific borrowing rate for that arrangement is applied.
For non-specific financing arrangements, a Group financing rate representative of the weighted average borrowing rate of the Group is used 2015: 4.2%, 2014: 4.0%.
Borrowing costs not arising in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are expensed.
Foreign currencies The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the Groups presentational currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are, on initial recognition, recorded in the functional currency of the entity at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange movements are included in the Group Income Statement for the period.
In previous periods, the Group utilised net investment hedging and exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provided a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity were taken directly to equity.
Upon the disposal or partial disposal of the net investment any accumulated foreign exchange reserves related to the investment are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The Group no longer uses net investment hedging but historic exchange differences remain in equity until the disposal of the specific investments.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity concerned are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the initial transaction.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups non-sterling functional currency subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The results of these generally foreign subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are translated into pounds sterling at the average rates of exchange for the relevant period.
The relevant exchange rates are shown below: Average rate for the year ended Closing rate at 31 December 31 December Exchange rate per pound sterling 2015 2014 2015 2014 US dollars 1.47 1.56 1.53 1.65 Canadian dollars 2.04 1.81 1.96 1.82 Euro 1.36 1.29 1.38 1.24 Norwegian kroner 13.04 11.67 12.35 10.40 Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets and results of non-sterling functional currency operations are transferred to the Groups foreign currency translation reserve, a separate component of equity, and are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference arising in the foreign currency translation reserve is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement on disposal.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 79, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of awards that will vest, and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The majority of the share-based payment charge arises from five schemes.
More information is included in the Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 79.
Deferred Matching Share Scheme DMSS : Applicable employees: Senior Executive Group.
From 2015 this scheme was replaced by the Annual Incentive Plan AIP and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors and On Track Incentive Plan OTIP for Senior Executives and senior management.
Vesting period of four years, comprising bonus year and three-year performance period.
Participants must defer between 20% and 40% of annual pre-tax bonus into scheme deferred shares and can elect to invest additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 50% of total potential bonus investment shares.
Deferred and investment shares will be matched with conditional shares.
On achievement of performance targets over a three-year period, matching shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years.
Performance measured through Group and segment Economic Profit EP targets.
Leaving prior to vesting date will normally mean forfeiting rights to deferred and matching shares.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS : Applicable employees: senior management.
Vesting period of three years following grant date.
Grants after 2012: number of shares calculated according to EPS, Group EP, total shareholder return TSR and non-financial KPIs.
Following the end of the assessed performance period, and subject to continued employment at that date, shares are either released immediately or delivered as nil cost options exercisable for seven years.
Leaving prior to vesting date will normally mean forfeiting rights.
Share Award Scheme SAS : Applicable employees: senior and middle management.
Shares vest subject to continued employment within the Group in two stages: half after two years and the other half after three years.
On Track Incentive Plan OTIP : Applicable employees: Senior Executives, senior and middle management.
Leaving prior to vesting date will normally mean forfeiting rights to the unvested share awards.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP : Applicable employees: Executive Directors.
Shares vest subject to continued employment and performance conditions after a three-year period.
Number of shares calculated according to EPS, Group EP and non-financial KPIs.
Mandatory holding period of two years following vesting during which claw back applies.
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: LTIS and LTIP Market value on the date of grant SAS, DMSS, OTIP Market value on the date of grant Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 138 F FINANC INANCIIAL S AL ST TA A T T E E M M E EN NTS TS N N O O TTE ES T S T O T O TH HE F EI F NIA NANC NCIAL S IAL TA ST TE ATEMEN MENTS TS 138 Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business combinations and goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method at the point the Group gains control over a business as defined by IFRS 3: Business combinations.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of other assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement at the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at FVLCD.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interests in the acquiree on an  basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of the non-controlling interests and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a stake in a joint venture or an associate represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The goodwill arising on an investment in a joint venture or in an associate is not recognised separately, but is shown under Interests in joint ventures and associates in the Group Balance Sheet.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture entity, any amount of goodwill attributed to that entity is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
A similar accounting treatment is applied on disposal of assets that represent a business.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets include contractual customer relationships, brands, application software, emissions trading schemes, renewable obligation certificates, and certain exploration and evaluation expenditures, the accounting policies for which are dealt with separately below.
For purchased application software, for example investments in customer relationship management and billing systems, cost includes contractors charges, materials, directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Amortisation commences at the point of commercial deployment.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life and are tested for impairment annually otherwise they are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset could be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for on a prospective basis by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset could be impaired, either individually or at the CGU level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
The amortisation periods for the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows: Contractual customer relationships Up to 20 years Strategic identifiable acquired brands Indefinite Application software Up to 15 years Licences Up to 20 years Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 S TRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 139 139 Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary information S2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES EU Emissions Trading Scheme and renewable obligation certificates Purchased carbon dioxide emissions allowances are recognised initially at cost purchase price within intangible assets.
The liability is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating profit.
Forward contracts for the purchase or sale of carbon dioxide emissions allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The intangible asset is surrendered and the liability is extinguished at the end of the compliance period to reflect the consumption of economic benefits.
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are recognised initially at cost within intangible assets.
A liability for the renewables obligation is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certificate buyout price for that period.
Any recycling benefit related to the submission of renewable obligation certificates is recognised in the Group Income Statement when received.
Exploration, evaluation, development and production assets The Group uses the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with an exploration well, including acquisition costs related to exploration and evaluation activities are capitalised initially as intangible assets.
Certain expenditures such as geological and geophysical exploration costs are expensed.
If the prospects are subsequently determined to be successful on completion of evaluation, the relevant expenditure including licence acquisition costs is transferred to PP&E.
If the prospects are subsequently determined to be unsuccessful on completion of evaluation, the associated costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.
All field development costs are capitalised as PP&E.
Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation of production facilities and include development drilling costs, project-related engineering and other technical services costs.
PP&E, including rights and concessions related to production activities, are depreciated from the commencement of production in the fields concerned, using the unit of production method, based on all of the 2P reserves of those fields.
Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.
The net carrying value of fields in production and development is annually compared on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial reserves.
An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the net present value of future net revenues.
Exploration assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment and production and development assets are tested annually for impairment.
Interests in joint arrangements and associates Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements are those that convey joint control which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
Associates are investments over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, and generally holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
The Groups joint ventures and associates as defined in note 6 are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets, less any impairment in value in individual investments.
The Group Income Statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations after tax and interest.
Accounting policies of the joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Upon initial acquisition goodwill may arise and is recognised within interests in joint ventures and associates in the Group Balance Sheet.
The Groups interests in joint operations oil and gas exploration and production licence arrangements are accounted for by recognising its assets including its share of assets held jointly, its liabilities including its share of liabilities incurred jointly, its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation, its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation and its expenses including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.
Where the Group has an equity stake or a participating interest in operations governed by a joint arrangement for which it is acting as operator, an assessment is carried out to confirm whether the Group is acting as agent or principal.
As the terms and conditions negotiated between business partners usually provide joint control to the parties over the relevant activities of the oil and gas fields and or wind farms that are governed by joint arrangements, the Group is usually deemed to be an agent when it is appointed as operator and not as principal as the contracts entered into do not convey control to the parties.
Accordingly, the Group recognises its equity share of these arrangements as outlined above except that it presents gross liabilities and gross receivables of the joint venture including amounts due to or from non-operating partners in the Group Balance Sheet in accordance with the netting rules of IAS 32: Financial instruments: presentation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Property, plant and equipment PP&E is included in the Group Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent expenditure in respect of items of PP&E such as the replacement of major parts, major inspections or overhauls, are capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset where it is probable that future economic benefits will arise as a result of the expenditure and the cost can be reliably measured.
All other subsequent expenditure, including the costs of day-to-day servicing, repairs and maintenance, is expensed as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other PP&E, with the exception of upstream production assets see above, are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation periods for the principal categories of assets are as follows: Freehold and leasehold buildings Up to 50 years Plant Five to 20 years Equipment and vehicles Three to 10 years Power stations and wind farms Up to 30 years Gas storage Up to 40 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as for owned assets, or where shorter, the lease term.
The carrying values of PP&E are tested annually for impairment and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and if necessary changes are accounted for prospectively.
Impairment assumptions Details of the approach taken to impairment are included in note 7 c. The following provides further information on the assumptions used in the VIU calculations: VIU Key assumptions used The VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans.
The Groups business plans are based on past experience, and adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, key risks, the implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate.
Commodity prices used in the planning process are based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates.
The extent to which the commodity prices used in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
a VIU Growth rates and discount rates Cash flows beyond the three-year plan period have been extrapolated using long-term growth rates in the market where the CGU operates.
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published by external analysts.
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each CGU.
Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU.
Additionally, risks specific to the cash flows of the CGUs are reflected within cash flow forecasts.
Each CGUs weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
Long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates used in the VIU calculations for each of the Groups CGUs are provided in the table below: British Gas British Gas Business energy British Gas Direct Energy Direct Energy Direct Energy Residential energy supply and Residential Residential Business energy Residential and Bord Gis supply services services energy supply i supply i business services i Energy 2015 % % % % % % % Growth rate to perpetuity 1.9 1.9 1.9 2.2 2.1 2.2 2.1 2.2 2.1 1.5 Pre-tax discount rate 7.4 7.4 7.4 8.5 8.0 8.5 8.0 8.5 8.0 7.2 British Gas British Gas Business energy British Gas Direct Energy Direct Energy Direct Energy Residential energy supply and Residential Residential Business energy Residential and Bord Gis supply services services energy supply i supply i business services i Energy 2014 % % % % % % % Growth rate to perpetuity 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.3 2.0 2.3 2.0 2.3 2.0 N A Pre-tax discount rate 7.4 7.4 7.4 8.4 8.0 8.4 8.0 8.4 8.0 N A i US Canada respectively.
b VIU Inflation rates Inflation rates used in the three-year business plan were based on a blend of a number of publicly available inflation forecasts for the UK, Canada and the US.
Inflation rates used for the value in use calculations were as follows: UK: 1.8% 2014: 2.0% : Canada: 2.1% 2014: 2.0% : Republic of Ireland 1.4% 2014: N A : and the US: 2.2% 2014: 2.2%.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Overlift and underlift Off-take arrangements for oil and gas produced from joint operations are often such that it is not practical for each participant to receive or sell its precise share of the overall production during the period.
This results in short-term imbalances between cumulative production entitlement and cumulative sales, referred to as overlift and underlift.
An overlift payable, or underlift receivable, is recognised at the balance sheet date within trade and other payables, or trade and other receivables, respectively and measured at market value, with movements in the period recognised within cost of sales.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in PP&E at their fair value, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank overdrafts and loans within current liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the finance lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Inventories Inventories are valued on a weighted-average cost basis, at the lower of cost, or estimated net realisable value after allowance for redundant and slow-moving items.
Decommissioning costs Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas and oil production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations at the end of their useful lives, based on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
When this provision relates to an asset with sufficient future economic benefits, a decommissioning asset is recognised and included as part of the associated PP&E and depreciated accordingly.
If there is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset is not fully recoverable, the asset is tested for impairment and an impairment loss is recognised where necessary.
Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively and reflected as an adjustment to the provision and corresponding decommissioning asset included within PP&E.
The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in the Group Income Statement within interest expense.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
The profits or losses and cash flows that relate to a major component of the Group that has been sold or is classified as held for sale are presented separately from continuing operations as discontinued operations within the Group Income Statement and Group Cash Flow Statement.
Pensions and other post employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period in which they occur in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is charged to the Group Income Statement over the periods benefiting from employees service.
Past service cost is recognised immediately.
Costs of administering the schemes are charged to the Group Income Statement.
Net interest, being the change in the net defined benefit liability or asset due to the passage of time is recognised in the Group Income Statement net finance cost.
The net defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation of the schemes, and the fair value of the schemes assets.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are paid, and that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised in the Group Income Statement as they fall due.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the Group Income Statement within interest expense.
Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Contracts to purchase or sell energy are reviewed on a portfolio basis given the fungible nature of energy, whereby it is assumed that the highest priced purchase contract supplies the highest priced sales contract and the lowest priced sales contract is supplied by the lowest priced purchase contract.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
From time to time, the Group may have open tax issues with a number of revenue authorities.
Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, management provides for its best estimate of the liability.
These estimates take into account the specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice.
Each item is considered separately and on a basis that provides the better prediction of the outcome.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill if impairment of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Groups assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group.
Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences expected from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
a Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually the original invoice amount and are subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the trade receivable.
If collection is due in one year or less receivables are classified as current assets.
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
b Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value, which is usually original invoice amount and are subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
If payment is due within one year or less payables are classified as current liabilities.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
c Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds received.
Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury or own shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
d Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES e Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings with banks and similar institutions are initially recognised at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except when they are the hedged item in an effective fair value hedge relationship where the carrying value is also adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risks.
Such fair value movements are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, discount or premium.
f Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale, which are recognised initially at fair value on the Group Balance Sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets are re-measured subsequently at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised directly in equity and presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Group Income Statement for the period.
Accrued interest or dividends arising on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the Group Income Statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that available-for-sale financial assets are impaired.
If any such evidence exists, cumulative losses recognised in equity are removed from equity and recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The cumulative loss removed from equity represents the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through the Group Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Group Income Statement for debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
g Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group holds investments in gilts which it designates as fair value through profit or loss.
Investments are measured at fair value on initial recognition and are re-measured to fair value in each subsequent reporting period.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the Group Income Statement within interest income or interest expense.
h Derivative financial instruments The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for physical delivery of gas, power and oil.
A portion of these transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the physical commodity in accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements own use, and are not within the scope of IAS 39.
The assessment of whether a contract is deemed to be own use is conducted on a Group basis without reference to underlying book structures, business units or legal entities.
Certain purchase and sales contracts for the physical delivery of gas, power and oil are within the scope of IAS 39 due to the fact that they net settle or contain written options.
Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised in the Group Balance Sheet at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the Group Income Statement for the year.
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of business.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Groups policies which are approved by the Board of Directors.
Further detail on the Groups risk management policies is included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 38 to 42 and in note S3.
The accounting treatment for derivatives is dependent on whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines.
Certain derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are designated in hedge accounting relationships which require the hedging relationship to be documented at its inception, ensure that the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective, and require that its effectiveness can be reliably measured.
The Group also holds derivatives that are used for hedging purposes which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships and are held for trading.
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the intention to net settle the derivative contracts is present.
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts covering periods for which observable market data does not exist.
The fair value of such derivatives is estimated by reference in part to published price quotations from active markets, to the extent that such observable market data exists, and in part by using valuation techniques, whose inputs include data which is not based on or derived from observable markets.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price, a fair value gain or fair value loss will arise.
This is referred to as a day-one gain or day-one loss.
Such gains and losses are deferred not recognised and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time observable market data becomes available.
When observable market data becomes available, any remaining deferred day-one gains or losses are recognised within the Group Income Statement.
Recognition of the gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the Group Income Statement and are included within gross profit or interest income and interest expense.
Gains and losses arising on derivatives entered into for speculative energy trading purposes are presented on a net basis within revenue.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Embedded derivatives: derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the Group Income Statement.
The closely related nature of embedded derivatives is reassessed when there is a change in the terms of the contract which significantly modifies the future cash flows under the contract.
Where a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives, and providing that the embedded derivative significantly modifies the cash flows under the contract, the option to fair value the entire contract may be taken and the contract will be recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement.
i Hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Note S5 details the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Nuclear activity The Groups investment in Lake Acquisitions Limited Nuclear is accounted for as an associate.
The following accounting policies are specific to the accounting for the nuclear activity of this associate.
a Fuel costs nuclear front end Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services and fuel element fabrication.
All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
b Fuel costs nuclear back end Advanced gas-cooled reactors AGR Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste products.
Back end fuel costs comprise a loading related cost per tonne of uranium and a rebate surcharge to this cost dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the year and are capitalised into inventory and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
Pressurised water reactor PWR Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs are capitalised into inventory on loading and charged to the Group Income Statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
c Nuclear property, plant and equipment and depreciation The nuclear fleet is depreciated from the date of the Group acquiring its share of the fleet on a straight-line basis, with remaining depreciable periods currently of up to 20 years.
Expenditure on major inspection and overhauls of production plant is depreciated over the period until the next outage which for AGR power stations is three years and for the PWR power station is 18 months.
d Nuclear Liabilities Fund NLF funding arrangements Under the arrangements in place with the Secretary of State, the NLF will fund, subject to certain exceptions, qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs.
In part consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, the former British Energy Group agreed to pay fixed decommissioning contributions each year and 150,000 indexed to RPI for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into the Sizewell B reactor after the date of these arrangements.
e NLF and nuclear liabilities receivables The UK Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities including PWR back end fuel services and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
f Nuclear liabilities Nuclear liabilities represent provision for liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning.
g Unburnt fuels at shutdown Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be quantities of unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure.
The costs relating to this unburnt fuel final core are fully provided for at the balance sheet date.
The provision is based on a projected value per tonne of fuel remaining at closure, discounted back to the balance sheet date and recorded as a long term liability.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including commodity price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall financial risk management processes are designed to identify, manage and mitigate these risks.
Further detail on the Groups overall risk management processes is included within the Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 38 to 42.
Financial risk management is overseen by the Group Financial Risk Management Committee GFRMC according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Commodity price risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit Financial Risk Management Committees and their respective financial risk management policies, as approved by the GFRMC under delegated authority Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 146 F FINANC INANCIIAL S AL ST TA A T T E E M M E EN NTS TS N N O O TTE ES T S T O T O TH HE F EI F NIA NANC NCIAL S IAL TA ST TE ATEMEN MENTS TS 146 Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary information S3.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT from the Board.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with the Groups financing and treasury policy, as approved by the Board.
The wholesale credit risks associated with commodity trading and treasury positions are managed in accordance with the Groups credit risk policy and collateral risk policy.
Downstream customer credit risk management is carried out in accordance with individual business unit credit policies.
Market risk management Market risk is the risk of loss that results from changes in market prices commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The level of market risk to which the Group is exposed at a point in time varies depending on market conditions, expectations of future price or market rate movements and the composition of the Groups physical asset and contract portfolios.
a Commodity price risk management The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its upstream assets, energy procurement contracts, downstream and proprietary energy trading activities and uses specific limits to manage the exposure to commodity prices associated with the Groups activities to an acceptable level.
The Group uses Profit at Risk PaR limits to control exposures to market prices.
These are complemented by other limits including Value at Risk VaR, volumetric or stop-loss limits to control risk around trading activities.
i Energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities The Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities consist of equity gas and liquids production, equity power generation, bilateral procurement and sales contracts, market-traded purchase and sales contracts and derivative positions transacted with the intent of securing gas and power for the Groups downstream customers in the UK, North America and the Republic of Ireland from a variety of sources at an optimal cost.
The Group actively manages commodity price risk by optimising its asset and contract portfolios and making use of volume flexibility.
The Groups commodity price risk exposure in its energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities is driven by the cost of procuring gas and electricity to serve its downstream customers and which varies with wholesale commodity prices.
The primary risk is that market prices for commodities will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the corresponding procurement cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing expected margins or making sales unprofitable.
The Group is also exposed to volumetric risk in the form of an uncertain consumption profile arising from a range of factors, including weather, energy consumption changes, customer attrition and economic climate.
There is also risk associated with ensuring there is sufficient commodity available to secure supply to customers.
In order to manage the exposure to market prices associated with the Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities the Group uses a specific set of limits including volumetric, VaR, PaR and stop-loss established by the Board, Executive Committee, GFRMC or business unit Financial Risk Committees.
PaR measures the estimated potential loss in a position or portfolio of positions associated with the movement of a commodity price for a given confidence level, over the remaining term of the position or contract.
VaR measures the estimated potential loss for a given confidence level over a predetermined holding period.
The standard confidence level used is 95%.
In addition, regular stress and scenario tests are performed to evaluate the impact on the portfolio of possible substantial movements in commodity prices.
The Group measures and manages the commodity price risk associated with the Groups entire energy procurement, upstream and downstream portfolio.
Only certain of the Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 note S6.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement, upstream and downstream contracts, it is the notional value of energy contracts being carried at fair value that represents the exposure of the Groups energy procurement, upstream and downstream activities to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7: Financial instruments: disclosures.
This is because energy contracts that are financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for on a fair value basis and changes in fair value immediately impact profit or equity.
Conversely, energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as executory contracts and changes in fair value do not immediately impact profit or equity, and as such, are not exposed to commodity price risk as defined by IFRS 7.
So whilst the PaR or VaR associated with energy procurement and downstream contracts outside the scope of IAS 39 is monitored for internal risk management purposes, only those energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are within the scope of the IFRS 7 disclosure requirements.
ii Proprietary energy trading The Groups proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken on with the intent of benefiting from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices.
The Group conducts its trading activities in the over-the-counter market and through exchanges in the UK, North America and continental Europe.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value of its trading assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in market prices for commodities.
The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading activities.
VaR measures the estimated potential loss at a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding period.
The carrying value of energy contracts used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2015 is disclosed in note 19.
As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR calculation.
VaR assumes that historical price behaviours will continue in the future and that the Groups trading positions can be unwound or hedged within the predetermined holding period.
Furthermore, the use of a 95% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account changes in value that might occur beyond this confidence level.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT b Currency risk management The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency denominated forecast transactions, firm commitments, monetary assets and liabilities transactional exposure and on its net investments in foreign operations translational exposure.
IFRS 7 only requires disclosure of currency risk arising on financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation transacting.
As a result, for the purposes of IFRS 7, currency risk excludes the Groups net investments in North America and Europe as well as foreign currency denominated forecast transactions and firm commitments.
i Transactional currency risk The Group is exposed to transactional currency risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the commercial operation transacting.
The Groups primary functional currencies are pounds sterling in the UK, Canadian dollars in Canada, US dollars in the US, Norwegian kroner in Norway and euros in the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.
Transactional exposure arises from the Groups energy procurement and upstream activities, where many transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has, in certain cases, issued foreign currency denominated debt, primarily in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen or Hong Kong dollars.
It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using derivatives to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.
At 31 December 2015, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions 2014: nil, other than transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures.
ii Translational currency risk The Group is exposed to translational currency risk as a result of its net investments in North America and Europe.
The risk is that the pounds sterling value of the net assets of foreign operations will decrease with changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to protect the pounds sterling book value of its net investments in foreign operations where appropriate, subject to certain parameters monitored by the GFRMC, by holding foreign currency debt, entering into foreign currency derivatives, or a mixture of both.
The Group manages translational currency risk taking into consideration the cash impact of any hedging activity as well as the risk to the net asset numbers in the Groups Financial Statements.
The translation hedging programme including the potential cash impact is monitored by the GFRMC.
c Interest rate risk management In the normal course of business the Group borrows to finance its operations.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the fair value of fixed rate borrowings and the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage the interest rate risk on long-term borrowings by ensuring the exposure to floating interest rates remains within a 30% to 70% range, including the impact of interest rate derivatives.
d Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates as a result of changes in the fair value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at 31 December 2015, assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk variable had occurred at 31 December 2015, and has been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of reasonably possible changes in price on profit or loss and equity to the next annual reporting date.
Reasonably possible changes in market variables used in the sensitivity analysis are based on implied volatilities, where available, or historical data for energy prices and foreign exchange rates.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates are based on management judgement and historical experience.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on 31 December 2015 balances and on the basis that the balances, the ratio of fixed to floating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2015 are all constant.
Excluded from this analysis are all non-financial assets and liabilities and energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.
The sensitivity to foreign exchange rates relates only to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the commercial operation transacting, and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations to pounds sterling.
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced.
This is because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is changing constantly as the Groups portfolio of commodity, debt and foreign currency contracts changes.
Changes in fair values or cash flows based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value or cash flows may not be linear.
In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group.
The sensitivity analysis provided excludes the impact of proprietary energy trading assets and liabilities because the VaR associated with the Groups proprietary energy trading activities is less than 5 million.
i Transactional currency risk The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group deems 10% movements to US dollar, Canadian dollar and euro currency rates relative to pounds sterling to be reasonably possible.
The impact of such movements on profit and equity, both before and after taxation, is immaterial to the Group except for US Dollar where a 10% upward movement would increase profit by 52 million and a 10% downward movement would decrease profit by 80 million.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT ii Interest rate risk The Group has performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in interest rates.
The Group deems a one percentage point move in UK, US and euro interest rates to be reasonably possible.
The impact of such movements on profit and equity, both after taxation, is immaterial.
iii Commodity price risk The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set out above are as follows: 2015 2014 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible Base price change in variable Base price change in variable Energy prices i % ii i % ii UK gas p therm 34 5 50 6 UK power MWh 36 4 47 5 UK coal US$ tonne 43 4 67 6 UK emissions tonne 8 1 8 1 UK oil US$ bbl 47 7 69 14 North American gas US cents therm 25 4 33 4 North American power US$ MWh 34 6 41 6 2015 2014 Impact on Impact on profit ii profit ii Incremental profit loss m m UK energy prices combined increase decrease 52 63 114 94 North American energy prices combined increase decrease 93 93 109 111 i The base price represents the average forward market price over the duration of the active market curve used in the sensitivity analysis provided.
ii The reasonably possible change in variable and the impact on profit are calculated using both the active and inactive market curves for all UK energy prices.
The impact on equity of such price changes is immaterial.
Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterpartys inability or failure to discharge its obligations under a contract.
The Group continually reviews its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits, and updates these as necessary based on a consistent set of principles.
It continues to operate within its limits.
In the US and Europe, there is a continued increase in trading over exchanges or margined contracts, this helps to reduce counterparty credit risk, but carries increased liquidity requirements.
The Group actively manages the trade-off between credit and liquidity risks by optimising the use of contracts with and without margining obligations.
The fall in global commodity prices during the year has added financial pressure to many of our counterparties and in some cases has had a detrimental impact on their financial strength and resulting credit risk profile.
These pressures have been and will continue to be taken into account in counterparty credit reviews.
During the 12 months ended 31 December 2015, many large European utilities have been downgraded lowering the overall credit assessment of the industry.
There have been significant downgrades for some specific European banks but as most have reduced their gas and power presence in Europe already this has not had a material impact.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in its treasury, trading, energy procurement and downstream activities.
Credit risk from financial assets is measured by counterparty credit rating as follows: 2015 2014 Receivables from Receivables from treasury, trading treasury, trading Derivative financial and energy Derivative financial and energy instruments with procurement Cash and cash instruments with procurement Cash and cash positive fair values counterparties equivalents positive fair values counterparties equivalents m m m m m m AAA to AA 16 7 404 9 27 282 AA to A 497 560 403 530 643 296 BBB to BBB 462 237 31 282 314 24 BB to BB 307 134 37 87 4 B or lower 13 1 4 114 i Unrated 81 108 22 68 226 15 1,376 1,047 860 930 1,411 621 i The unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Details of how credit risk is managed across the asset categories are provided below.
a Treasury, trading and energy procurement activities Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits.
The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist see S6 Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, master netting arrangements and similar arrangements for details of amounts offset.
In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of bank and parent company guarantees and letters of credit.
See note 24 c for details of cash posted or received under margin or collateral agreements.
100% of the Groups credit risk associated with its treasury, trading and energy procurement activities is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of information about the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only.
Only certain of the Groups energy procurement contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, whilst the Group manages the credit risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy procurement contracts, it is the carrying value of financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 note S6 that represents the maximum exposure to credit risk in accordance with IFRS 7. b Downstream activities In the case of business customers, credit risk is managed by checking a companys creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship.
For residential customers, creditworthiness is ascertained normally before commencing trade to determine the payment mechanism required to reduce credit risk to an acceptable level.
Certain customers will only be accepted on a prepayment basis or with a security deposit.
In some cases, an ageing of receivables is monitored and used to manage the exposure to credit risk associated with both business and residential customers.
In other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed by grouping customers according to method of payment or profile.
Liquidity risk management and going concern Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group experiences significant movements in its liquidity position due primarily to the seasonal nature of its business and margin cash arrangements associated with certain wholesale commodity contracts.
To mitigate this risk the Group maintains significant committed facilities and holds cash on deposit.
See note 24 b for further information.

Upon demerger, the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at the nominal value of shares issued to BG plc shareholders.
In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the shares issued.
On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Companys shares issued and the amount of share capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger was credited to a merger reserve.
Capital redemption reserve In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, the Company has transferred to the capital redemption reserve an amount equal to the nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled.
Up to 31 December 2015 the cumulative nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled was 26 million 2014: 26 million.

OTHER EQUITY Revaluation reserve During 2005, the revaluation to fair value of the Groups existing interest in the Humber power station was recorded as a revaluation reserve adjustment following the acquisition by the Group of the remaining 40% in its owner, Centrica SHB Limited.
In 2014, an impairment charge was made against the Humber power station, of which 13 million was recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income through the revaluation reserve together with an offsetting 3 million deferred tax movement.
Own shares reserve The own shares reserve reflects the cost of shares in the Company held in the Centrica employee share ownership trusts to meet the future requirements of the Groups share-based payment plans.
Treasury shares reserve Treasury shares are acquired equity instruments of the Company.
During 2014, the Group purchased 420 million of its own shares on the market under the share repurchase programme.
The Group subsequently cancelled 154.3 million treasury shares with a nominal value of 10 million during 2014.
The repurchase cost of 549 million was transferred to retained earnings.
Share-based payments reserve The share-based payments reserve reflects the obligation to deliver shares to employees under the Groups share schemes in return for services provided.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve comprises exchange adjustments on the translation of the Groups foreign operations.
Historically the Group has hedged its net investments in these foreign operations and the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve includes exchange translation adjustments on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under the requirements of IAS 39.
Note S5 provides further detail on historical net investment hedges.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises fair value movements on instruments designated as cash flow hedges under the requirements of IAS 39.
Amounts are transferred from the cash flow hedging reserve to the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet as and when the hedged item affects the Group Income Statement or Group Balance Sheet which is, for the most part, on receipt or payment of amounts denominated in foreign currencies and settlement of interest on debt instruments.
Note S5 provides further detail on cash flow hedging.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or, in previous periods, hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The fair values of derivatives and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at 31 December were as follows: 2015 2014 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities 31 December m m m m Fair value hedges 129 2 155 1 Cash flow hedges 28 69 13 88 The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are described below.
Fair value hedges A derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and its relationship to a recognised asset or liability is classified as a fair value hedge when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of that recognised asset or liability.
The Groups fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term debt due to movements in market interest rates.
Any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Group Income Statement within net finance cost.
The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the Group Income Statement.
Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
Gains or losses arising on fair value hedges net of gains or losses arising on hedged items attributable to the hedged risk for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 were immaterial.
Cash flow hedges A derivative is classified as a cash flow hedge when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
The Groups cash flow hedges consist primarily of: forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions: Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 S TRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 153 153 Notes to the Financial Statements Supplementary information S5.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING interest rate swaps used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with floating-rate borrowings due to movements in market interest rates: and cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with borrowings denominated in non-functional currencies.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective is recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
The gains or losses that are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income are transferred to the Group Income Statement in the same period in which the highly probable forecast transaction affects income.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability on its recognition.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs.
If the transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Note S4 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The ineffective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging is immaterial and is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
Net investment hedges Historically the Group engaged in net investment hedging NIH whereby it would obtain foreign currency debt issued in the same currency as its net investment in a foreign operation.
Such hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity: any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Group Income Statement.
In 2009 the Group ceased to NIH, however the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve includes cumulative exchange translation adjustments on borrowings and derivatives classified as a NIH under the requirements of IAS 39.
These balances will be recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of the relevant foreign operation.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Group has documented internal policies for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.
a Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and held at fair value are classified into one of three categories, known as hierarchy levels, which are defined according to the inputs used to measure fair value as follows: Level 1: fair value is determined using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: fair value is determined using significant inputs that may be directly observable inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data: and Level 3: fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS During 2014, 31 million of net assets were transferred out of Level 1 into Level 2 as a result of the reassessment of derivatives held within the Hess Energy Marketing business acquired in 2013.
There were no other significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2015 and 2014.
The reconciliation of the Level 3 fair value measurements during the year is as follows: 2015 2014 Financial assets Financial liabilities Financial assets Financial liabilities m m m m Level 3 financial instruments 1 January 15 321 125 81 Total realised and unrealised losses gains: Recognised in Group Income Statement 63 195 69 18 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements net 26 41 2 260 i Transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 2 15 45 3 Foreign exchange movements 3 14 6 1 ii Other 18 82 31 December 35 114 15 321 Total gains losses for the year for Level 3 financial instruments iii held at the end of the reporting year 8 3 61 233 i Transfers between levels are deemed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period.
ii Other movements reflect margin collateral balances which have now been offset against the related Level 3 derivatives.
The impact on 2014 balances is not considered to be material.
iii 8 million gains 2014: 61 million losses for the year for Level 3 financial assets held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 2014: nil were recognised in other comprehensive income.
3 million losses 2014: 233 million for the year for Level 3 financial liabilities held at the end of the reporting year were recognised within certain re-measurements and no gains or losses 2014: nil were recognised in other comprehensive income.
b Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 and Level 3 fair values and Group valuation process Level 2 interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market.
Level 2 energy derivatives are fair valued by comparing and discounting the difference between the expected contractual cash flows for the relevant commodities and the quoted prices for those commodities in an active market.
The average discount rate applied to value this type of contract during 2015 was 1% 2014: 1% Europe and 3% 2014: 3% North America per annum.
For Level 3 energy derivatives, the main input used by the Group pertains to deriving expected future commodity prices in markets that are not active as far into the future as some of our contractual terms.
This applies to certain contracts within the UK and US.
Fair values are then calculated by comparing and discounting the difference between the expected contractual cash flows and these derived future prices using an average discount rate of 2% 2014: 1% UK and 7% 2014: 7% US per annum for 2015.
Active period of markets Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil UK years 3 3 3 3 3 North America years 5 Up to 5 N A Up to 5 3 Because the Level 3 energy derivative valuations involve the prediction of future commodity market prices, sometimes a long way into the future, reasonably possible alternative assumptions for gas, power, coal, emissions or oil prices may result in a higher or lower fair value for Level 3 financial instruments.
Given the relative size of these fair values, it is unlikely that the impact of these reasonably possible changes would be significant when judged in relation to the Groups profit and loss or total asset value.
It should be noted that the fair values disclosed in the tables above only concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39.
The Group has numerous other commodity contracts which are outside of the scope of IAS 39 and are not fair valued.
The Groups actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Groups portfolio of energy contracts changes.
The Groups valuation process includes specific teams of individuals that perform valuations of the Groups derivatives for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 valuations.
The Group has an independent team that derives future commodity price curves based on available external data and these prices feed in to the energy derivative valuations.
The price curves are subject to review and approval by the Groups Executive Committee and valuations of all derivatives, together with other contracts that are not within the scope of IAS 39, are also reviewed regularly as part of the overall risk management process.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for contracts which extend beyond the active period differs from the transaction price, a day-one gain or loss will arise.
Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Group Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available see note S2 for further detail.
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the Group Income Statement relating to the differences between the transaction prices and the amounts that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is immaterial.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS c Fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost The carrying value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are approximately equal to their fair value except as listed below: 2015 2014 Carrying value Fair value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Fair value 31 December Notes m m hierarchy m m hierarchy i Bank overdrafts and loans 24 d 222 279 Level 2 739 792 Level 2 Bonds Level 1 24 d 5,795 6,078 Level 1 5,094 5,676 Level 1 Level 2 24 d 77 113 Level 2 78 111 Level 2 Obligations under finance leases 24 d 250 272 Level 2 237 268 Level 2 i 2014 includes 427 million of liabilities where the carrying value is considered to approximate the fair value of the instrument.
Financial liabilities The fair values of bonds classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy are based on quoted market prices.
The fair values of Level 2 bonds and bank loans have been determined by discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest.
The fair values of overdrafts, short-term loans and commercial paper are assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts.
The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Groups cost of borrowing.
Other financial instruments Due to their nature and or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.

FIXED-FEE SERVICE AND INSURANCE CONTRACTS This section includes fixed-fee service FFS and insurance contract disclosures for services related to British Gas Residential services and Direct Energy Residential and business services.
FFS contracts in North America are entered into with home and business services customers.
FFS contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Services Limited BGSL.
Insurance contracts in the UK are entered into with home services customers by British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL, authorised by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and the PRA.
Product offerings include central heating, boiler and controls, plumbing and drains and electrical appliance insurance cover.
FFS contracts continue until cancelled by either party: insurance contracts normally provide cover for 12 months with the option of renewal.
The contracts protect policyholders against the risk of breakdowns, resulting in the transfer of an element of risk to the contract provider.
Benefits provided to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into: however, they generally include maintenance, repair and or replacement of the items affected.
The levels of risk exposure and service provision to customers under contract terms are dependent on the occurrence of uncertain future events, in particular the nature and frequency of faults and the cost of repair or replacement of the items affected.
Accordingly, the timing and amount of future cash outflows associated with the contracts is uncertain.
The key terms and conditions that affect future cash flows are as follows: provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service: one safety and maintenance inspection either annually or in every continuous two-year period, as set out in the agreement: no limit to the number of call-outs to carry out repair work: and limits on certain maintenance and repair costs.
Revenue is recognised over the life of contracts having regard to the incidence of risk, in particular the seasonal propensity of claims which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being available throughout the contract term.
Costs incurred to settle claims represent principally the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home services and the cost of parts utilised in repair or maintenance.
These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a given year.
Weather conditions and the seasonality of repairs both affect the profile of the workload and associated costs incurred across the year.
The risk exposure of these uncertain events is actively managed by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: an initial service visit is provided to customers taking up most central heating contracts and in some instances pre-existing faults may lead to the contract being cancelled and no further cover being provided: an annual maintenance inspection is performed as part of most central heating contracts to help identify and prevent issues developing into significant maintenance or breakdown claims: and contract limits are applied to certain types of maintenance and repair work considered to be higher risk in terms of frequency and cost.
The costs of FFS claims and insurance claims incurred during the year were 42 million 2014: 79 million and 381 million 2014: 344 million respectively and are included in the table below in Expenses relating to FFS and insurance contracts.
All claims are settled immediately and in full.
Due to the short average lead time between claims occurrence and settlement, no material provisions were outstanding at the balance sheet date 2014: nil.

Any deficiency is charged immediately to the Group Income Statement.
Claims frequency is sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact of weather conditions.
The contracts are not exposed to any interest rate risk or significant credit risk and do not contain any embedded derivatives.

RELATED UNDERTAKINGS Transactions with non-controlling interests On 1 October 2014, Direct Energy Resources Partnership, the wholly owned immediate parent undertaking of CQ Energy Canada Partnership, contributed the Groups wholly owned gas and liquids assets in Canada to CQ Energy Canada Partnership in return for a capital stake in the partnership of C$538 million 297 million.
At the same time, the non-controlling interest subscribed for a further C$215 million 119 million of capital in the partnership for cash.
The cash was used to repay, in part, the Groups partnership loan to CQ Energy Canada Partnership.
Group and non-controlling interests partnership loans of C$144 million and C$239 million 80 million and 132 million respectively were then converted to capital, leaving Group and non-controlling interests partnership loans of C$30 million and C$20 million 17 million and 11 million respectively outstanding.
From a Group perspective, the gas and liquid assets were not disposed of, since they remained controlled by a subsidiary of the Group.
Instead, this was a transaction with the non-controlling interest who paid C$215 million 119 million for a share of additional Group assets.
This payment, together with the conversion of C$239 million 132 million partnership loans, and a reduction in the Groups deferred tax liability of C$59 million 32 million since the non-controlling interest was now responsible for 40% of the tax consequences of the contributed assets, resulted in an increase in the non-controlling interest of C$513 million 283 million in 2014.
In the underlying financial information of the partnership, predecessor accounting was followed.
