RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION WH Smith PLC has operated a number of dened benefit and dened contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a dened benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a dened contribution scheme, WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 4 a i.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the relevant reporting dates were: m 2015 2014 WHSmith Pension Trust 5 55 United News Shops Retirement Benets Scheme 1 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 6 55 Recognised as: Current liabilities 1 11 Non-current liabilities 5 44 a Dened benefit pension schemes i The WHSmith Pension Trust The WHSmith Pension Trust Final Salary Section is a funded final salary dened benefit scheme: it was closed to dened benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996.
Benets are based on service and salary at the date of closure or leaving service, with increases currently based on CPI ination in deferment and RPI ination in payment.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION CONTINUED The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for administration and management of the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the Trust Deed and relevant legislation.
Responsibilities include the investment of funds, the triennial valuation and determining the deficit funding schedule.
Under the terms ofthe Trust Deed there are ten Trustee directors of which three are appointed by the Sponsor, four are member-nominated directors, andthree are independent.
Trustee directors are appointed for a term of six years, and are then eligible for re-appointment.
The WHSmith Pension Trust, has assets valued at 1,162m as at 31 August 2015 managed by third party investment managers.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy where the assets in the investment fund were invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and ination.
The LDI structure that is in place has a number of ination and interest rate hedges and equity option agreements, with collateral posted daily to or from the scheme to the relevant counterparty.
The risk of failure of counterparties could expose the scheme to loss.
The schemes liabilities are also subject to changes in longevity.
The principal risks associated with the Groups dened benefit pension arrangements are as follows: Longevity risk Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with increases in life expectancy leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities.
Interest rate and Inflation risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest rates and ination, with lower interest rates or higher ination leading to an increase inthe valuation of liabilities.
As a result of the LDI policy outlined above, these risks are largely hedged.
An Investment Committee of the Trustees to the scheme meets regularly to review the performance of the investment managers and the scheme as a whole.
The Company is represented on this Committee.
Although investment decisions are the responsibility of the Trustee, the Group takes an active interest to ensure that pension plan risks are managed efficiently and is an active participant of the investment sub-committee.
The risk of failure of counterparties and of the investment manager is monitored regularly by the Committee.
The Trustees have the right to determine the level of contributions and the Company has agreed with the Trustees a deficit funding schedule.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2014 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
At 31 March 2014 the deficit was 24m, and a revised deficit funding schedule of approximately 3m per annum, with effect from 1 October 2014 for the following nine years, was agreed with the Trustee.
During the year ending 31 August 2015, the Group made a contribution of 4m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2014: 14m in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule.
The weighted average duration of the dened benefit obligation is 19 years.
With effect from 1 September 2015 the Group agreed to pay certain investment management costs on behalf of the Trustee.
The annual deficit funding agreement is around 1m per annum with effect from 1 September 2015.
The minimum funding requirement liability recognised on the balance sheet as at 31 August 2015 reects this revised deficit funding schedule.
The Group expects the cash payments for the year ended 31 August 2016, payable to the Trustee, to be 1m, and approximately 3m in total in relation to the scheme.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements Balance Sheet The amounts recognised in the balance sheet under IAS 19 in relation to this plan are as follows: m 2015 2014 Present value of the obligations 948 932 Fair value of plan assets 1,162 1,087 Surplus before consideration of asset ceiling 214 155 Amounts not recognised due to effect of asset ceiling 214 155 Additional liability recognised due to minimum funding requirements 5 55 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 5 55 The pension scheme is closed to further accrual and given the LDI policy adopted by the Pension Trustee, the present value of the economic benets of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of 214m 2014: 155m available on a reduction of future contributions is nil 2014: nil.
As a result the Group has not recognised this IAS 19 surplus on the balance sheet.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.

The charge for the current service cost has been included in administrative costs.
The net interest cost has been included in finance costs Note 8.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
In the year ended 31 August 2014, following a change to the trivial commutation limit from 18,000 to 30,000 announced in the 2014 Budget, members of the WHSmith Pension Trust were given the opportunity to take a trivial commutation payment.
The result of this exercise was the recognition of a past service credit of 1m in the prior year, as a result of 6m of liabilities being removed from the Trust compared to 5m of assets paid out for trivial commutation.
This has been disclosed in the Group Income Statement as a non-underlying one-off item and is excluded from Headline Group profit before tax.

Management has determined that no impairment was necessary for the current financial year 2014: nil.
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions.
The key assumptions on which forecast three-year cash ows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash ows are extrapolated for up to an additional nine years representing the average length of the lease for the relevant group of stores based on estimated long-term growth rates of between 0 and 2.5 per cent.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is ten per cent pre-tax 2014: ten per cent.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to one per cent.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario.
On 24 November 2014, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Supanews, a retailer of news, books and convenience products in Australia, for a cash consideration of 3m.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 3m, comprising goodwill of 2m, representing synergies and future growth opportunities, and intangible assets being the value of the brand and franchise agreements of 1m.
Details of revenues and profits generated have not been disclosed as they are not material in the context of these financial statements.

Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement with Connect Group PLC formerly Smiths News PLC, any such contingent liability which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between the Group and Connect Group PLC in the ratio 65:35 provided that the actual liability of Connect Group PLC in any 12-month period does not exceed 5m.
The Groups 65 per cent share of these leases has an estimated future rental commitment at 31 August 2015 of 4m 2014: 7m.
The movement in the future rental commitment is due to the crystallisation of lease liabilities, lease expiries and the efuxion of time.
Contracts placed for future capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in this combined financial information amount to 5m 2014: 1m.

The fair value measurements relating to the instruments are derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
2 Included within loans and receivables are trade and other receivables, current tax assets and cash and cash equivalents.
3 Included within amortised cost are trade and other payables, current tax liabilities, borrowings and other non-current liabilities.
Comparison of carrying values and fair values There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
Risk management The Groups treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, and to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Groups Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Capital risk The Groups objectives with respect to managing capital dened as net debt funds plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to optimise returns to shareholders and benets for other stakeholders, through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
Refer to Note 20 for the value of the Groups net debt funds and refer to the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for the value of the Groups equity.
In managing the Groups capital levels the Board regularly monitors the level of debt in the business, the working capital requirements, forecast nancing and investing cash ows.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to investors while ensuring sufficient capital is retained in the business to meet its strategic objectives.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings calculated on a normalised tax basis.
As at 15 October 2015 the Group has in place a 93.3m committed multi-currency revolving credit facility, carrying certain financial covenants which have been met throughout the period.
The covenants, tested half-yearly, are based on xed charges cover and net borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash ow forecasts.
The Group has a five-year committed multi-currency revolving credit facility with a number of financial institutions which is available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
The Group has a policy of pooling cash ows in order to optimise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the Group to reduce the costs of external short-term funding.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash ows of the Groups financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due over 2015 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 9 9 Trade and other payables 262 1 263 Total cash ows 271 1 272 Due within Due between Due between Due over 2014 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 12 12 Trade and other payables 261 1 262 Total cash ows 273 1 274 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Group has credit risk attributable to its trade and other receivables including a number of sale or return contracts with suppliers.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
The Group has low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group treasury policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-1 and long-term ratings of A1 or better.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash ow interest rate risk on oating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 31 August 2015, the Group had drawn down 9m 2014: 12m from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group draws down on its facility, but does not view any draw down as long-term in nature and therefore does not enter into interest rate derivatives to mitigate this risk.
indd 89 23 11 2015 15:56 WH Smith PLC Annual report and accounts 2015 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 23.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US dollar, euro and Australian dollar.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash ows denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD GBP exchange rates.
These are designated as cash ow hedges.
At 31 August 2015, the Group had no material un-hedged currency exposures.
The Groups euro and Australian dollar exposure is principally operational and arises mainly through the operation of retail stores in France, Ireland and Australia.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.
The fair value of cash ow hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets liabilities is shown below: m 2015 2014 Fair value of derivative assets At 31 August 2015, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed is US$31m 2014: US$29m.
These instruments will be used to hedge cash ows occurring within up to two years of the balance sheet date.
Gains totalling nil 2014: nil have been transferred to both the income statement and inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2015.
In the year to 31 August 2015, the fair value loss on the Groups currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash ow hedges amounted to nil 2014: 1m loss.
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by level 2 inputs as dened by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, Fair value measurement.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 August 2015 Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and USD GBP, EUR GBP and AUD GBP exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Exchange rate uctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash ow hedge relationship affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reecting the positions at 31 August 2015 and 31 August 2014 respectively.
As aconsequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in GBP LIBOR Base rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in USD GBP, EUR GBP and AUD GBP exchange rates of ten per cent are shown, reecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over time.
Using these assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity.
2015 2014 Income Equity Income Equity m gains loss gains loss gains loss gains loss GBP LIBOR Base rate interest rates 1% increase USD GBP exchange rates 10% increase 2 2 EUR GBP exchange rates 10% increase AUD GBP exchange rates 10% increase GBP LIBOR Base rate interest rates 1% decrease USD GBP exchange rates 10% decrease 2 2 EUR GBP exchange rates 10% decrease AUD GBP exchange rates 10% decrease 90 Financial Statements v62.

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made bythe directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
