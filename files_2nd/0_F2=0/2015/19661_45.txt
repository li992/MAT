Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the acquisition.
The Groups identified cash-generating units are smaller than the four reportable segments, being the 13 operating companies.
Bolt-on acquisitions are quickly integrated into existing Group companies and are therefore not considered separately.
The most significant amounts of goodwill are as follows: 2015 2014 Pre-tax Pre-tax Goodwill discount rate Goodwill discount rate m % m % Omega Engineering 178.9 13.4 170.1 13.4 PANalytical 87.7 12.0 92.7 12.0 Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration 63.4 11.9 65.0 11.9 HBM 81.4 12.4 64.9 12.4 BTG 49.3 11.8 50.6 11.8 The remaining balance of goodwill is allocated between the other eight cash-generating units, none of which is individually significant.
As part of the annual impairment review, the carrying amount of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity, reflecting the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit based on actual operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year as approved by the Board, and strategic review projections for 2017 and 2018.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to business performance over the next three years, projected longterm growth rates beyond 2018 and the discount rates applied.
The forecast cash flows include managements latest estimates on sales volumes and pricing, production and other costs.
There are no individually significant business level cash flow assumptions in respect of any business that materially impact the impairment testing.
The key judgements are the level of revenue and operating margins anticipated and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year.
Growth rates for the years beyond 2018 are assumed to be 2.5% 2014: 4.0% based on the Groups like-for-like sales growth performance since 2012, current forecast global industrial production growth rates, and long-term GDP growth rates for the Groups primary markets.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using cash-generating unit specific pre-tax discount rates between 11% and 18% 2014: 11% and 18%.
These rates have been determined by taking the size of business and specific geographical and industry risk factors into account.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge was recognised in either 2015 or 2014.
The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in the key assumptions has therefore been reviewed, based on the following sensitivities in isolation: a two percentage point pp increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each cash-generating unit: if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced by 1.5 pp to 1%: and if the cash flow projections of all cash-generating units were reduced by 25% for the next two years.
For each cash-generating unit, with the exception of Omega Engineering, the Directors do not consider that there are any reasonably possible sensitivities for these businesses that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in an impairment charge being recognised.
For Omega Engineering, reasonable possible changes in the key assumptions could cause the estimated recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value, such as a reduction in the assumed long-term growth rate by 0.6 pp to 1.9%, or an increase in the assumed discount rate of 0.8 pp to 14.2%.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, there were no reasonably possible sensitivities for any cash-generating unit that could have arisen which would have resulted in an impairment charge being recognised in the following 12 months.
Other intangible assets Of the total amortisation charge of 37.8m 2014: 29.4m, the amount attributable to the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets was 33.0m 2014: 25.9m.
The amount attributable to impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets was 1.6m 2014: nil.
The Group has no internally-generated intangible assets from development expenditure as the criteria for the recognition as an asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets have not been met 2014: nil.
