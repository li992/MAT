ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING POLICIES These accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
A summary of the material accounting policies adopted are described below.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a profit and loss account of the Company is not presented.
The Companys profit after taxation for the 52 week period 26 April 2015 was 1,824,000 2014: 417,000 loss.
INVESTMENTS Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs less provision for impairment.
Provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST An Employee Benefit Trust has been established for the purposes of satisfying certain share-based awards.
The Group has fide facto control over the special purpose entity.
The Trust is fully consolidated within the accounts.
The cost of shares acquired by the Sports Direct Employee Benefit Trust is recognised within Own share-reserve in equity.
DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
No timing differences are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
A deferred tax asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit in future is more unlikely than not.
97 Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES Items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
At the balance sheet date all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate or at the rate of exchange at which the transaction is contracted to be settled in the future.
All exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account.
DIVIDENDS Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the Companys Financial Statements, and as a deduction from equity, in the period in which the dividends are declared.
Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of the Companys shareholders, the dividends are only declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company, with the exception of those accounted for via merger relief available under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
INCOME FROM GROUP UNDERTAKINGS Income from Group undertakings is recognised when qualifying consideration is received from the Group undertaking.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with wholly-owned subsidiaries which form part of the Group.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20, Share-based Payments.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The fair value of the share options on the date of the grant is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the share option, based on the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
A corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
At each balance sheet date the company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and recognises the impact of any revision of original estimates in the profit and loss account.
