If the amount of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is greater, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
HSBCs CGUs are based on geographical regions subdivided by global business.
Impairment testing is performed at least annually, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of a CGU is based on its assets and liabilities, including attributable goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
VIU is the present value of the expected future CGU cash flows.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill is carried on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is included in a disposal group if the disposal group is a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated or it is an operation within such a CGU.
The amount of goodwill included in a disposal group is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.
At the date of disposal of a business, attributable goodwill is included in HSBCs share of net assets in the calculation of the gain or loss on disposal.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Goodwill impairment The review of goodwill for impairment reflects managements best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as follows: the future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to the cash flows projected for the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter.
Forecasts are compared with actual performance and verifiable economic data, but they reflect managements view of future business prospects at the time of the assessment: and the rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their valuation and are based on the costs of capital assigned to individual CGUs.
The cost of capital percentage is generally derived from a CAPM, which incorporates inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables, including the risk-free interest rate in the country concerned and a premium for the risk of the business being evaluated.
These variables are subject to fluctuations in external market rates and economic conditions beyond managements control, are subject to uncertainty and require the exercise of significant judgement.
The accuracy of forecast cash flows is subject to a high degree of uncertainty in volatile market conditions.
In such circumstances, management retests goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually when indicators of impairment exist to ensure that the assumptions on which the cash flow forecasts are based continue to reflect current market conditions and managements best estimate of future business prospects.
Goodwill was allocated based on the relative carrying value of the operations in Brazil to the cash generating units in Latin America.
See Note 23 for further details.
Impairment testing HSBCs impairment test in respect of goodwill allocated to each CGU is performed as at 1 July each year.
A review for indicators of impairment is undertaken at each subsequent quarter end and, as at 31 December 2015, this review identified indicators of impairment for two CGUs, recognised as sensitive in the annual test performed as at 1 July.
As a result, an impairment test has been performed for Global Private Banking Europe and Global Banking and Markets North America as at 31 December 2015 and the goodwill balances, key assumptions and results of this test are included in the disclosures below.
For all other CGUs the annual test performed as at 1 July remains the latest impairment test and the disclosures given are as at 1 July.
The testing at both 1 July and 31 December resulted in no impairment of goodwill.
Basis of the recoverable amount The recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its VIU at each respective testing date for 2014 and 2015.
For each significant CGU, the VIU is calculated by discounting managements cash flow projections for the CGU.
The discount rate used is based on the cost of capital HSBC allocates to investments in the countries within which the CGU operates.
The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective within the Group of the business units making up the CGUs.
For the goodwill impairment test conducted at 1 July 2015, managements cash flow projections until the end of 2019 were used.
For the goodwill impairment test conducted at 31 December 2015, managements cash flow projections until the end of 2020 were used.

Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU: the cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans approved by the GMB.
Nominal long-term growth rate: this growth rate reflects GDP and inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates or derives revenue from.
The rates are based on IMF forecast growth rates as they represent an objective estimate of likely future trends.
The rates used for 2014 and 2015 do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the countries within which the CGUs operate or derive revenue from.
Discount rate: the discount rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, which is derived using a CAPM.
The CAPM depends on inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables including the riskfree rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated.
These variables are based on the markets assessment of the economic variables and managements judgement.
The discount rates for each CGU are refined to reflect the rates of inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates.
In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM with cost of capital rates produced by external sources for businesses operating in similar markets.
For 2014 and 2015, internal cost of capital rates were consistent with externally sourced rates.
For the purpose of goodwill testing during 2015, internal rates were adjusted to reflect the uncertainty of the cash flows used in the test.
Sensitivities of key assumptions in calculating VIU At 1 July 2015 Global Banking and Markets Europe, and as at 31 December Global Banking and Markets North America and Global Private Banking Europe, were all sensitive to reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions supporting the recoverable amount.
In making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to assumptions management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the model such as: the external range of discount rates observable: historical performance against forecast: and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying cash flow projections.
For Global Banking and Markets North America, a reasonably possible adverse change in any one of the discount rate, growth rate or managements projections of cash flows could cause an impairment to be recognised.
For Global Private Banking Europe, a reasonably possible adverse change in managements projections of cash flows, or changes in more than one assumption, could cause an impairment to be recognised.
Global Banking and Markets Europe, would require reasonably possible adverse changes in more than one assumption to cause an impairment.
The following table presents a summary of the key assumptions underlying the most sensitive inputs to the model for each CGU: the key risks attaching to each: and details of a reasonably possible change to assumptions where, in the opinion of management, these could result in an impairment.

Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets are recognised, and those that are acquired in a business combination are distinguished from goodwill, when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to HSBC, the cost of which can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets include the present value of in-force long-term insurance business and long-term investment contracts with discretionary participating features PVIF, computer software, trade names, mortgage servicing rights, customer lists, core deposit relationships, credit card customer relationships and merchant or other loan relationships.
Computer software includes both purchased and internally generated software.
The cost of internally generated software comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the software to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately as incurred.
Intangible assets are subject to impairment review if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where: intangible assets have an indefinite useful life, or are not yet ready for use, they are tested for impairment annually.
An intangible asset recognised during the current period is tested before the end of the current year: and where intangible assets have a finite useful life, except for PVIF, they are stated at cost less amortisation and accumulated impairment losses and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful life is the lower of legal duration and expected useful life.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are generally amortised, on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives as follows: Trade names 10 years Mortgage servicing rights between 5 and 12 years Internally generated software between 3 and 5 years Purchased software between 3 and 5 years Customer merchant relationships between 3 and 10 years Other 10 years HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 410 Present value of in-force long-term insurance business The value placed on insurance contracts that are classified as long-term insurance business or long-term investment contracts with discretionary participating features DPF and are in force at the balance sheet date is recognised as an asset.
The asset represents the present value of the equity holders interest in the issuing insurance companies profits expected to emerge from these contracts written at the balance sheet date.
The PVIF is determined by discounting the equity holders interest in future profits expected to emerge from business currently in force using appropriate assumptions in assessing factors such as future mortality, lapse rates and levels of expenses, and a risk discount rate that reflects the risk premium attributable to the respective contracts.
The PVIF incorporates allowances for both non-market risk and the value of financial options and guarantees.
The PVIF asset is presented gross of attributable tax in the balance sheet and movements in the PVIF asset are included in Other operating income on a gross of tax basis.

See page 180 for further details.
In the PVIF calculation, expected cash flows are projected after adjusting for a variety of assumptions made by each insurance operation to reflect local market conditions and managements judgement of future trends, and after applying risk margins to reflect any uncertainty in the underlying assumptions.
Variations in actual experience and changes to assumptions can contribute to volatility in the results of the insurance business.
The key drivers of the movement in the value of the PVIF asset are the expected cash flows from: new business adjusted for anticipated maturities and assumptions relating to policyholder behaviour value of new business written during the year : unwind of the discount rate less the reversal of expected cash flows for the period expected return : changes in non-economic operating assumptions such as mortality or lapse rates changes in operating assumptions : the effects of changes in projected future cash flows associated with operating assumption experience variances compared with those assumed at the start of the period experience variances : changes related to future investment returns changes in investment assumptions : and the effect of actual investment experience on existing assets compared with the assumptions at the start of the period investment return variances.
The valuation of the PVIF asset includes explicit risk margins for non-economic risks in the projection assumptions and explicit allowances for financial options and guarantees using stochastic methods.
Risk discount rates are set on an active basis with reference to market risk-free yields.
HSBC HOLDINGS PLC 411 Shareholder Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Financial Review Strategic Report Notes on the Financial Statements continued 20 Goodwill and intangible assets Key assumptions used in the computation of PVIF for main life insurance operations Economic assumptions are either set in a way that is consistent with observable market values or, in certain markets including those where the risk free curve is not observable at tenors matching the duration of our insurance contract liabilities use is made of long-term economic assumptions.
Setting such assumptions involves the projection of long-term interest rates and the time horizon over which observable rates tend towards these long-term assumptions.
The assumptions are informed by relevant historical data and by research and analysis performed by the Groups Economic Research team and external experts, including regulatory bodies.
The valuation of PVIF will be sensitive to any changes in these long-term assumptions in the same way that it is sensitive to observed market movements, and the impact of such changes is included in the sensitivities presented below.
Sensitivity to changes in economic assumptions The Group sets the risk discount rate applied to the PVIF calculation by starting from a risk-free rate curve and adding explicit allowances for risks not reflected in the best estimate cash flow modelling.
Where shareholders provide options and guarantees to policyholders the cost of these options and guarantees is an explicit reduction to PVIF, unless it is already allowed for as an explicit addition to the technical provisions required by regulators.
See page 184 for further details of these guarantees.
The following table shows the effect on the PVIF of reasonably possible changes in the main economic assumption, risk-free rates, across all insurance manufacturing subsidiaries.
Due to certain characteristics of the contracts, the relationships are nonlinear and the results of the sensitivity testing should not be extrapolated to higher levels of stress.
For the same reason, the impact of the stress is not symmetrical on the upside and downside.
The sensitivities shown are before actions that could be taken by management to mitigate effects and allow for adverse changes in policyholder behaviour.
The sensitivities have decreased from 2014 to 2015, driven mainly by rising yields and updates to interest rate parameters in France during 2015.
In a low yield environment the PVIF asset is particularly sensitive to yield curve movements driven by the projected cost of options and guarantees described on page 184.

Sensitivity to changes in non-economic assumptions Policyholder liabilities and PVIF for life manufacturers are determined by reference to non-economic assumptions including mortality and or morbidity, lapse rates and expense rates.
