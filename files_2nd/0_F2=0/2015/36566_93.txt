Financial instruments The table below sets out the categorisation of the financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2015.
Where the financial instruments are held at fair value the valuation level indicates the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
