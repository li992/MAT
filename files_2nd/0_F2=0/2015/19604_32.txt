180 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors As explained more fully in the Statement of directors responsibilities set out on page 120, the directors are responsible for the preparation ofthe financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 ofPart 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs UK & Ireland.
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures inthe financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied : the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 2015 the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, ormaterially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention modified to include revaluation ofcertain financial instruments, share options and pension assets and liabilities held at fair value.
As permitted by Section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, the Companys entity profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses have not been presented.
As permitted by Section 408 2, information about the Companys employee numbers and costs isnot presented.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8: Related Party Disclosures not to disclose transactions with other wholly owned members of the Smiths Group.
Adoption of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework Following changes to the UK accounting standards and regulations, from 1 August 2015 Smiths Group plc will need to adopt a new accounting framework for the Company financial statements.
It is considered that adopting FRS 101 would provide the most relevant and cost-effective disclosures for Smiths Group plc.
On adoption of FRS 101, no disclosures in the current financial statements would be omitted.
Shareholder approval for the adoption of FRS 101 will be sought at the Groups next Annual General Meeting in November 2015.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the retranslation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred over the term of the lease.
Where a leasehold property is vacant, or sub-let under terms such that the rental income is insufficient to meet all outgoings, provision ismade for the anticipated future shortfall up to termination of the lease.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the relevant assets by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives.
Ingeneral, the rates used are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2%: Short leasehold property over the period of the lease: Plant, machinery, etc.
10% to 20%: Fixtures, fittings, tools and other equipment 10% to 33%.
Fixed asset investments The Companys investments in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises.
Financial instruments The policies disclosed in the Group accounting policies on pages 132 to 137 for recognition, measurement and presentation of financial instruments are applied in the Company accounts.
Where there are no differences between the disclosures required for the Group and the Company in respect of a class of financial instruments, an appropriate cross-reference is made to the Group accounts.
Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed as at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as disclosed in the accounts, arising from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the accounts.
Deferred tax is not recognised on any fixed assets that have been revalued unless there is a binding agreement to sell the asset.
Provisions Provisions for disposal indemnities, restructuring costs, vacant leasehold property and legal claims are recognised when: the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 183 Accounts Governance Strategic report Risks and responsibility Strategic report Operational review Strategic report Strategic overview Company accounting policies Continued Post-retirement benefits The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
For defined benefit plans the liability for each scheme recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of AA corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, andthat have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the profit and loss account, and are presented in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time thevestingperiod.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Contributions are expensed as incurred.
The Company also has certain post-retirement healthcare schemes which are accounted for on a similar basis to the defined benefit plans.
Share-based payment The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares or share options granted is recognised over the vesting period to reflect the value of the employee services received.
The charge relating to grants to employees of the Company is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account and the charge for grants to employees of other group companies is recognised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary.
The fair value of options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, is calculated using established option pricing models, principally binomial models.
The probability of meeting non-market vesting conditions, which include profitability targets, is used to estimate the number of share options which are likely to vest.
For cash-settled share-based payment a liability is recognised based on the fair value of the payment earned by the balance sheet date.
For equity-settled share-based payment the corresponding credit is recognised directly in reserves.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are authorised.
The interim dividend is recognised when it is paid and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

8 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for it as a defined benefit pension plan, in accordance with FRS 17.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed with effect from 31 October 2009.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2012.
This valuation has been updated byindependent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 July 2015, incorporating demographic experience identified during work on the 31 March 2015 valuation, which is ongoing.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions tothe schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.1% 4.2% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.2% 3.3% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.2% 3.3% Discount rate 3.5% 4.0% Inflation rate 3.2% 3.3% Healthcare cost increases 4.7% 4.3% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2015 187 Accounts Governance Strategic report Risks and responsibility Strategic report Operational review Strategic report Strategic overview Notes to the Company accounts Continued 8 Post-retirement benefits continued The mortality assumptions used are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2014 CMI projections blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The assumptions give thefollowing: Expected further years of life 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 23 24 23 25 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 24 26 25 27 The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2015 were: 31 July 2015 31 July 2014 Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m Equities 7.3% 23 Government bonds 2.5% 770 3.2% 508 Corporate bonds 3.5% 284 4.0% 267 Insured liabilities 3.5% 22 4.0% 31 Property 6.2% 174 6.9% 181 Managed growth funds 5.4% 337 Cash and money market funds 10.9% 226 3.2% 629 Total market value 1,813 1,639 Present value of funded pension scheme liabilities 1,843 1,784 Deficit 30 145 Unfunded pension plans 52 50 Post-retirement healthcare 7 7 Net retirement benefit liability 89 202 The growth rate on cash and money market funds represents the expected growth on the synthetic equity investment strategy which SIPS introduced in August 2014, because the cash is held to meet margin calls on the exchange-traded futures used to implement this strategy.
At31 July 2015 the fair value of the equity future contract derivatives held by the scheme was 0.03 m. The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.

Until these negotiations arecompleted, the current contributions will continue as follows: Cash contributions to SIPS of 36m a year until October 2019.
In connection with SIPS, an ongoing investment of 24m a year in index-linked gilts held in an escrow account.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow will be allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
Contributions to the scheme are made on the advice of the scheme actuaries.
The impact of changes in healthcare cost trend rates is not material, because a substantial proportion of the post-retirement healthcare liability has been capped at a fixed annual contribution.
