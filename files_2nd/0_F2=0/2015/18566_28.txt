Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements a General information G4S plc the company is incorporated in the United Kingdom, registered in England and Wales, and domiciled in the UK.
It is a public company, limited by shares.
The companys registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the companys functional currency, and in millions of pounds.
b Statement of compliance These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
c Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The principal accounting policies and measurement bases adopted are the same as those disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, except as noted below, and have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless stated otherwise.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, have been disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
The company has early-adopted certain amendments to FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements and to FRS 101 issued in July 2015 by the Financial Reporting Council.
These amendments related to changes made to the Companies Act 2006 to maintain consistency with company law and the application of The Companies, Partnerships, and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2015 SI 2015 980.
SI 2015 980 allowed, among other items, the format of the financial statements to be presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs instead of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern Pages 116 to 188 of the consolidated financial statements contain information on the performance of the group, its financial position, cash flows, net debt position and borrowing facilities.
Further information, including financial risk management policies, exposures to market and credit risk and hedging activities, is given in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements, Financial risk.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Transition to FRS 101 These financial statements were prepared by the directors in accordance with FRS 101 for the first time.
FRS 101 grants elections and certain exemptions from its full requirements when preparing the first financial statements that conform to FRS 101.
An explanation of these and how the transition affected the previously reported financial position and financial performance of the company has been disclosed in note u to these financial statements.
The date of transition from the previous accounting standards to FRS 101 was 1 January 2014.
Comparable historical financial information has therefore been provided in accordance with FRS 101 as at 1 January 2014 and as at, and for the year ended, 31 December 2014.
Exemptions In accordance with section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
The company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements are included in the publicly available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc.
These disclosure exemptions relate to: the presentation of a third or opening statement of financial position at the date of transition to FRS 101 and related notes: the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union: new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the company: comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible assets and certain other additional comparative information: information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units containing goodwill and managements approach to determining these amounts: financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 191 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued c Significant accounting policies continued Exemptions continued certain related party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between two or more wholly-owned members of a group: and capital management disclosures.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
The accounting policy for impairments in investments in subsidiaries has been disclosed in note 3 k to the consolidated financial statements.
Amounts owed by to group undertakings Amounts owed by to group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Finance income and costs are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets The company provides for impairments in financial assets when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that impact the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets.
Share-based payments The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed or capitalised, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant.
The value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date the liability is settled.
The fair value of share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the company and capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of those subsidiary companies.
Financial guarantees The company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group.
The company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
The company therefore treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

The company issued further fixed rate loan notes in the US Private Placement market totalling US$514m and 69m on 15 July 2008.
US$65m of these notes matured and were repaid on 15 July 2013, and US$150m matured and were repaid on 15 July 2015.

Provisions include estimates of the likely fees for outsourced services required to ensure members pension benefits are correctly recorded and paid.
The settlement of the majority of these provisions is expected to occur within one year.

The source of the market prices is Bloomberg and in addition the third party relationship counterparty banks.
The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the floating rate cash flows anticipated under the instrument which are discounted back to the reporting date.
This value is compared to the original transaction value giving a fair value of the instrument at the reporting date.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and using inputs based on observable market data.
Judgement is used to determine the relevant inputs, currency yield curves and discount rates.
Although these judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Currency risk and cross currency swaps The group conducts business in many currencies.
The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company, together with its subsidiary G4S International Finance plc, hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of the groups overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
On consolidation, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
However, in the companys own financial statements, translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the income statement and are in part hedged by cross currency swaps.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 25m are outstanding which were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$50m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
These swaps will mature in July 2018.
194 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the company to fair value interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
When fixed floating interest rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable directly from investors, interest rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend and meet Treasury policy, with the proportion of fixed interest rate held reducing on a sliding scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors preferring a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the 350m public notes issued in May 2009, was initially kept at fixed rate.
In April 2014, the interest rate on 44m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on all of the 350m public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to floating for a period of three years using derivatives.
These swaps have also been documented as fair value hedges.
The 350m public notes have a coupon step up of 1.25% which is triggered should the credit rating of the company fall below investment grade.
k Retirement benefit obligations Following the adoption of FRS 101, the company has been determined to be the sponsoring company for the groups UK defined benefit pension scheme, to which it provides a guarantee over all payments to be made to the scheme by the operating companies.
The required disclosures for this scheme are given in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The following disclosures relate to the UK scheme only and are given because the same disclosures in note 32 of the group financial statements refer to the consolidated group position and include certain non-UK schemes.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and the various components of income, other comprehensive income and cash flow are as follows: Obligation Assets Total 2015 m m m At 1 January 2015 2,222 1,983 239 Amounts recognised in income Current service cost in cost of sales 5 5 Interest on obligations and assets in finance costs 81 73 8 Administration costs paid from plan assets in administration expenses 2 2 Total amounts recognised in income 88 73 15 Remeasurements Actuarial gain change in financial assumptions 13 13 Actuarial loss change in demographic assumptions 34 34 Actuarial gain experience 33 33 Return on assets in excess of interest 3 3 Remeasurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 12 3 15 Cash Employer contributions 50 50 Benefits paid from plan assets 80 80 Net cash 80 30 50 At 31 December 2015 2,218 2,029 189 Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 195 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued k Retirement benefit obligations continued Obligation Assets Total 2014 m m m At 1 January 2014 2,011 1,562 449 Amounts recognised in income Current service cost in cost of sales 5 5 Interest on obligations and assets in finance costs 87 68 19 Administration costs paid from plan assets in administration expenses 1 1 Total amounts recognised in income 93 68 25 Remeasurements Actuarial loss change in financial assumptions 189 189 Actuarial gain experience 1 1 Return on assets in excess of interest 376 376 Remeasurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 188 376 188 Cash Employer contributions 47 47 Employee contributions 1 1 Benefits paid from plan assets 71 71 Net cash 70 23 47 At 31 December 2014 2,222 1,983 239 Contributions in 2015 included 44m 2014: 42m of additional contributions in respect of the deficit in the UK scheme.

During the year a previously unrealised gain of 1,078m relating to the sale of certain investments in subsidiaries in 2011 as part of a wider reorganisation of the UK holding company legal structure was realised and therefore re-classified as distributable reserves.
The gain became realised as a result of a transaction in 2015 which involved the settlement of outstanding inter-company receivables due from one subsidiary with loans payable to another subsidiary.
o Auditors remuneration Fees payable to PwC for the audit of the companys annual financial statements have been disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

s Contingent liabilities To help secure cost effective finance facilities for its subsidiaries, the company issues guarantees to some of its finance providers.
At 31 December 2015 guarantees totalling 373m 2014: 370m were in place in support of such facilities.
The company also guarantees the debt obligations of certain subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2015 contingent liabilities of 1,192m 2014: 956m were outstanding in support of such debt obligations.
t Dividends Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders of the company in the year have been disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
u Transition to FRS 101 Between 2012 and 2015 the Financial Reporting Council revised financial reporting standards for the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
The revision fundamentally reformed financial reporting, replacing all previous accounting standards with FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements and other related standards, which are applicable from 1 January 2015.
Under FRS 100, the company has elected to apply FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework in its annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions for the individual financial statements of subsidiaries and ultimate parents that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of adopted IFRSs.
As stated in the Significant accounting policies note, these are the companys first financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
The transition date from the legacy UK GAAP to FRS 101 was 1 January 2014.
The policies disclosed in the Significant accounting policies note have been applied in preparing these financial statements for each of the years ended, and as at, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, and in the preparation of an opening FRS 101 statement of financial position as at 1 January 2014.
In preparing its opening FRS 101 statement of financial position the company has adjusted amounts reported in its previous statutory annual report and financial statements.
An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has affected the companys financial position and financial performance has been provided below.
As the company previously prepared its consolidated financial statements under IFRS, it has measured its assets and liabilities at the same amounts in both the consolidated and parent company financial statements, except for consolidation adjustments.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 197 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued u Transition to FRS 101 continued First-time adoption of FRS 101 FRS 101 grants elections and certain exemptions from its full requirements when preparing the first financial statements that conform to FRS 101.
Investment in subsidiaries The carrying amounts of the companys investments in subsidiaries have been unaffected by the transition to FRS 101.
Financial instruments including derivatives and hedge accounting Under legacy UK GAAP, the company complied with the requirements of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
FRS 25 implemented IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 implemented the recognition, measurement and hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement into legacy UK GAAP for those companies within its scope.
As the company had accounted for its financial instruments under FRS 25 and FRS 26, and formally designated its hedges under FRS 26, it has complied with the requirements of IAS 32 and IAS 39 under FRS 101.
The carrying values of the companys financial instruments and derivatives under legacy UK GAAP have therefore been unaffected on transition to FRS 101 on 1 January 2014.
Share-based payment transactions Under legacy UK GAAP the company previously applied FRS 20 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment when accounting for its share-based payment transactions.
As there are no differences between FRS 20 and the FRS 101 equivalent, IFRS2 Share-based Payment, transactions previously recognised in equity relating to share options that were granted after 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2014 have been unaffected by the transition to FRS 101.
Reconciliation of equity A reconciliation of the companys equity reported in accordance with legacy UK GAAP to its equity in accordance with FRS 101 as at 1 January 2014 and as at 31 December 2014 has been provided below.

Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 199 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued u Transition to FRS 101 continued Explanation of transition adjustments continued Note B Presentational adjustments to the statement of financial position due to the transition to FRS 101 On transition to FRS 101, the company has reclassified the following items.
Non-current current assets and liabilities.
Under FRS 101, as permitted by the early adoption of SI 2015 980, the company has presented all assets and liabilities on a non-current and current basis.
The following balances reported under legacy UK GAAP have been reclassified accordingly: within current assets, debtors due after more than one year relating to derivatives and deferred tax assets.
As at 1 January 2014 this resulted in re-classifications of 52m and 1m respectively 31 December 2014: 53m and 1m respectively.
Deferred and current tax assets are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position in accordance with FRS 101 instead of within debtors under legacy UK GAAP.
Under FRS 101, the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the derivatives in a cash flow hedging relationship is deferred within equity in a separate reserve, the hedging reserve, which is net of tax.
These balances were previously recognised in retained earnings.
As at 1 January 2014, 1m was transferred from retained earnings to the hedging reserve.
The equivalent re-classification as at 31 December 2014 was also 1m, after the additional recycling of foreign exchange from the hedging reserve to the income statement see below.
Note C Retirement benefit obligations Under legacy UK GAAP when an employer could not identify its share of the assets and liabilities of a group pension scheme on a reasonable and consistent basis, the scheme was accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
The company therefore only accounted for the contributions payable to the scheme during the year within operating profit in its income statement.
Under FRS 101, IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires the company to recognise the following items: In its statement of financial position: the difference between the market value of the assets of the scheme and the present value of accrued pension liabilities as a net asset or net liability.
An asset relating to one scheme can be offset against a liability relating to another if the right of offset exists.
In its income statement: the current service cost within operating profit: and net finance costs on the net defined benefit obligation within financing costs.
In other comprehensive income: actuarial gains and losses arising from experience or assumption changes: and returns on scheme assets in excess of those recognised in the income statement.
Due to the transition to FRS 101, retirement benefit obligations of 480m and a retirement benefit surplus of 31m before tax were recognised on 1 January 2014.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the legacy UK GAAP accounting was reversed and amounts recognised in both the income statement and other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 19 18m and 188m gains respectively.
At 31 December 2014 the retirement benefit obligations were 314m and the retirement benefit surplus was 75m.
The impact due to deferred tax has been disclosed in Note F. Note D Recycling of hedging reserves Under FRS 101 certain hedging transactions are reported in a separate hedging reserve.
The hedging reserve consists of the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the derivatives in a cash flow hedging relationship deferred within equity, which for the company mainly represented the net change in the fair value of its cross currency swaps.
The effective portion of the cross currency swaps relating to foreign exchange movements should have been subsequently recycled to the income statement to offset the foreign exchange revaluation of the associated loan notes.
However under legacy UK GAAP this recycling was omitted.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, 8m of gains previously reported within equity was recycled to the income statement to offset the foreign exchange losses on the associated loan notes.
The related deferred tax adjustment has been disclosed in Note F. 200 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Note E Share-based payments Under legacy UK GAAP, the amount charged to the companys income statement for share-based payments reflected the expense related both to employees of the company and to employees of the companys subsidiaries.
However, in circumstances where the company settles awards for services provided to its subsidiaries by the subsidiaries employees, the company can capitalise these costs as a cost of investment in those subsidiaries.
Following the transition to FRS 101, share-based payment charges of 4m previously expensed to the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2014 were capitalised and included within the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
Note F Deferred tax Under legacy UK GAAP deferred tax was recognised on timing differences arising in the income statement.
Timing differences arose from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in the taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Under FRS 101, IAS 12 Income Taxes requires full provision for all taxable temporary differences unless specifically exempted.
Deferred tax is recognised in the statement of financial position by applying the appropriate tax rate to the temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the companys financial statements.
Due to the transition to FRS 101, deferred tax was recognised on retirement benefit obligations.
As at 1 January 2014, deferred tax assets of 90m were recognised on the statement of financial position.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, a loss of 42m was recognised 4m in the income statement and 38m in other comprehensive income resulting in a deferred tax asset on the statement of financial position of 48m as at 31 December 2014.
The deferred tax adjustment related to the recycling of hedging reserves see Note D resulted in a deferred tax loss of 1m being charged to the income statement instead of equity under legacy UK GAAP.
Statement of changes in equity Under legacy UK GAAP the financial statements included a reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds as a primary statement.
Under FRS 101, this has been replaced by the statement of changes in equity, which analyses in more detail the changes in equity during the year.
