Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 11 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The carrying value of acquired brands is split as follows: 2015 2014 m m Wychwood 13.6 13.6 Jennings 2.8 2.8 Ringwood 2.9 2.9 Thwaites 12.8 32.1 19.3 Acquired brands relate to Brewing.
Impairment testing of acquired brands The carrying values of acquired brands are subject to annual impairment reviews on a value in use basis.
The recoverable amount of each brand is calculated based on anticipated future income generated by that brand.
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing of brands are a pre-tax discount rate of 6.0% 2014: 7.5% and a long-term growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the cash ow projection period of one year of 2.0% 2014: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term growth rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects, and take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had sufficient levels of headroom and as such no impairment of acquired brands was required in the current or prior period.

92 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 12 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED Revaluation impairment At 1 February 2015 independent chartered surveyors revalued the Groups freehold and leasehold properties on an open market value basis.
These valuations have been incorporated into the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been recognised in the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
During the current and prior period various properties were reviewed for impairment and or material changes in value.
These valuation adjustments were recognised in the revaluation reserve or the income statement as appropriate.
The impact of the revaluations impairments described above is as follows: 2015 2014 m m Income statement: Revaluation loss charged as an impairment 60.1 7.4 Reversal of past impairment 26.3 33.8 7.4 Revaluation reserve: Unrealised revaluation surplus 216.5 16.4 Reversal of past revaluation surplus 120.6 3.4 95.9 13.0 Net increase in shareholders equity property, plant and equipment 62.1 5.6 Fair value of land and buildings IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reects the signicance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly orindirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements of land and buildings have beencategorised: 2015 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements m m m m m m m m Land and buildings: Specialised brewery properties 25.0 25.0 23.7 23.7 Other land and buildings 1,922.0 1,922.0 1,799.5 1,799.5 1,922.0 25.0 1,947.0 1,799.5 23.7 1,823.2 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
The Level 2 fair values of land and buildings have been obtained using a market approach, primarily using earnings multiples derived from prices in observed transactions involving comparable businesses.
The Level 3 fair values of the specialised brewery properties have been obtained using a cost approach.
These breweries represent properties that are rarely, if ever, sold in the market, except by way of a sale of the business of which they are part, due to the uniqueness arising from their specialised nature, design and conguration.
As such the valuation of these properties has been performed using the depreciated replacement cost approach, which values the properties at the current cost of replacing them with their modern equivalents less deductions for physical deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimisation.
