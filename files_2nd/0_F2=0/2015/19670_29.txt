Refer to note 27 of the Group financial statements.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and on an historical basis.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no material uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the Company can continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future.
The Company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the Group.
To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both Group and Company financial statements, refer to the Group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy.
Material policies that apply to the Company only are included as appropriate.
The Company has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the income statement of the Parent Company.
The Company did not have items to be reported as other comprehensive income: therefore, no statement of comprehensive income was prepared.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THIS SECTION Investment in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment, the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its value-in-use.
The value-in-use is calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 16 to the Group financial statements.
Share-based payments The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the Company.
KEY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS SECTION Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries assets based on value-in-use calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 16 of the Group financial statements.

Interest on these borrowings in the year amounted to 0.2 million 2014: nil and the Directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the Company given its size in relation to the Companys net assets.

With effect from 17 January 2013, the total third-party annual commitments of the Group under these operating leases increased by 51.3 million per annum.
