Prior to the closure, active members received pensionable salary increases which were capped each year at the Retail Price Index RPI or 2.5% if lower.
Deferred pensions are assumed to increase in line with the Consumer Price Index CPI.
At the date the Scheme closure was effected, the best estimate of future CPI was almost identical to the salary growth assumption, hence the closure does not result in any curtailment item.
