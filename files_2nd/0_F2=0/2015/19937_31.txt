Share-based Payments 9.1 Accounting policy The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
9.2 Profit and loss account recognition The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed between pages 88 to 90 of the Directors Remuneration Report.
0.5m was credited to the profit and loss account in the year with regard to share-based payments 2014: 1.3m charge.
9.3 Details of outstanding options The information in the tables below has been restated to take into account the demerger of the Alent business from the Cookson Group.

The fair value of options with market-related performance conditions are measured using the Monte Carlo model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over the period from the date of listing to grant date of 2.25 years 2014: 1.25 years.
The risk free rate of return was assumed to be the yield to maturity on a UK fixed gilt with the term to maturity equal to the expected life of the option.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee award holders receive the value of dividends that would have been paid on their vested shares in the period between grant and vesting.
Accordingly, there is no discount to the valuation for dividends forgone during the vesting period.
Contingent Liabilities Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
