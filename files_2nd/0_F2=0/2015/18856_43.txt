$m At 1 January 2015 460.0 Exchange movements on retranslation of net assets 25.4 Share of profit after tax 26.6 Impairment of investments 137.2 Dividends 23.6 At 31 December 2015 300.4 During 2015, trading in the EthosEnergy joint venture, which is part of the Wood Group PSN Turbine activities segment, was behind plan and it became apparent to the directors in the second half of the year that the business would be unlikely to meet the future profit forecasts which were made when the JV was formed in April 2014, and had previously supported its carrying value.
As a result, an impairment charge of $137.2m has been taken against our investment in EthosEnergy.
In addition, the Group has provided $9.3m against a receivable from EthosEnergy which management believes is unlikely to be fully recovered.
Both of these items have been treated as exceptional items in the financial statements see note 4.
EthosEnergy has also recognised impairment losses of $12.6m relating to operations which it intends to divest or close during 2016 and this is reflected in the exceptional income line in the table above.
In arriving at the post impairment carrying value, the directors have established a value in use based on the Groups share of the joint ventures future expected cash flows.
These have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 15%, which is higher than the Groups weighted average cost of capital to reflect the risks inherent in this business, and the discounted value has been compared to the carrying value of the investment.
In calculating the value in use, the joint ventures forecasts assume revenue growth into 2016 of 13% and a further 8% into 2017, which is supported by recent contract awards for 2016 and sales pipeline for 2017.
In finalising their forecast the directors have added contingency against the profits arising from these contracts to significantly reduce their impact.
The forecasts also assumes working capital inflows of $28m and $42m in 2016 and 2017 respectively, which are supported by recent contract awards and strategic plans to reduce inventory levels and assumes that further overhead cost savings will be delivered in the near term, improving net margins.
Longer term growth rates are assumed at 3% which represents our assessment of the long-term average growth rates in the markets and countries in which the joint venture operates.
If these growth, working capital or cost assumptions are not met then a further impairment may be required in future years.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and the discount rate is increased by 1% in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
The sensitivity analysis showed that a 1% reduction in the terminal growth rate would have resulted in an additional impairment of $13.8m and a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an additional impairment of $18.9m.
The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, nor has the Group any significant contingent liabilities in relation to its interest in the joint ventures.
