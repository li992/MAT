ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Preparation St. Jamess Place plc the Company is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales and whose shares are publicly traded.
The Company offers a range of insurance, investment and other wealth management services through its subsidiaries, which are incorporated in the UK, Ireland and Asia.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical costs convention, on a going concern basis and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Companys accounting policies.
No significant accounting judgements have been made.
First Time Application of FRS 100 and FRS 101 In the current year the Group has adopted FRS 100 and FRS 101.
In previous years the financial statements were prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
This change in the basis of preparation has not materially altered the recognition and measurement requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP.
Consequently, the principal accounting policies are unchanged from the prior year.
The change in basis of preparation has enabled the Group to take advantage of all of the available disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 101 in the financial statements, the most significant of which are summarised below.
There have been no other material amendments to the disclosure requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP.
