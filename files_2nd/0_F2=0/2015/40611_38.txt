Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 1.
CORPORATE INFORMATION The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiaries and were approved by the Board for issue on 16 March 2015.
Tritax Big Box REIT plc the Company is a public listed company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority, a division of the Financial Conduct Authority, and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1-46.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations.
The prior period is for a period of greater than 12 months, due to the change of year end of the Company to align it with the calendar year.
As a result the comparative information disclosed in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income is not directly comparable.
The Groups financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, as modified for the Groups investment properties and interest rate derivatives, which have been measured at fair value through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The consolidated financial information is presented in Sterling, which is also the Groups functional currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000, except where otherwise indicated.
The Group has chosen to adopt EPRA best practice guidelines for calculating key metrics such as net asset value and earnings per share.
Going concern The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained within Accountability on pages 58-59.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Groups financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial information: Business combinations The Group acquires subsidiaries that own investment properties.
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset.
The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property.
Where such acquisitions are not judged to be the acquisition of a business, they are not treated as business combinations.
Rather, the cost to acquire the corporate entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based upon their relative fair values at the acquisition date.
Accordingly, no goodwill or additional deferred tax arises.
82 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 Operating lease contracts the Group as lessor The Group has acquired investment properties that are subject to commercial property leases with tenants.
The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, particularly the duration of the lease terms and minimum lease payments, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and so accounts for the leases as operating leases.
Fair valuation of investment property The fair value of investment property is determined, by independent property valuation experts, to be the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of the valuation in an arms length transaction.
Properties have been valued on an individual basis.
The valuation experts use recognised valuation techniques applying the principles of both IAS 40 and IFRS 13.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards January 2014 the Red Book.
Factors reflected include current market conditions, annual rentals, lease lengths and location.
The significant methods and assumptions used by valuers in estimating the fair value of investment property are set out in note 15.
Fair valuation of interest rate derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, the Group values its interest rate derivatives at fair value.
The fair values are estimated by the loan counterparty with revaluation occurring on a quarterly basis.
The counter parties will use a number of assumptions in determining the fair values including estimations over future interest rates and therefore future cash flows.
The fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the cash flows produced by the contracted rate and the valuation rate.
Group refinancing arrangements The Group undertook a debt refinancing during the year, to lower its cost of borrowing and provide it with flexible debt arrangements.
In accordance with IAS39, the Group has evaluated whether or not the refinancing represents an extinguishment of the old financial instruments and whether this would give rise to a gain or loss being recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In doing so, the Group has considered that it has met all criteria for the refinancing not to be considered an extinguishment of a liability, which includes, existing borrower and lender relationships, the qualitative test and the 10% present value test of cash flows, where the net present value of future cash flows of the refinanced instrument do not differ from those of the existing instrument by more than 10%.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 4.1.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, as at the year end date.
Subsidiaries Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary.
The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed wherever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
Segmental information The Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment business, being the investment in the United Kingdom in Big Box assets.
83 Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS 4.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 4.4.
Investment property and investment property under construction Investment property comprises completed property that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both.
Property held under a lease is classified as investment property when it is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in production or administrative functions.
The corresponding entry upon recognising lease incentives or fixed minimum rental uplifts is made to investment property.
For further details please see Accounting Policy note 4.14.1.
Investment property is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and is measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
Transaction costs include transfer taxes, professional fees for legal services and other costs incurred in order to bring the property to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is stated at fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values are included in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise under IAS 40 Investment Property.
Investment properties under construction are financed by the Group where the Group enters into contracts for the development of a pre-let property under a funding agreement.
All such contracts specify a fixed amount of consideration.
The Group does not expose itself to any speculative development risk as the proposed building is pre-let to a tenant under an agreement for lease and the Group enters into a fixed price development agreement with the developer.
Investment properties under construction are initially recognised at cost including any associated costs, which reflect the Groups investment in the assets.
Subsequently, the assets are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of investment properties under construction is estimated as the fair value of the completed asset less any costs still payable in order to complete, which include an appropriate developers margin.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in identifiable future economic benefits, which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written-off in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Investment properties cease to be recognised when they have been disposed of or withdrawn permanently from use and no future economic benefit is expected from disposal.
The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset would result in either gains or losses at the retirement or disposal of investment property.
Any gains or losses are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year of retirement or disposal.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate caps and swaps for hedging purposes, are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at fair value being the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the period end date, taking into account current interest rate expectations and the current credit rating of the Company and its counterparties.
The gain or loss at each fair value remeasurement date is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Premiums payable under such arrangements are initially capitalised into the Group Statement of Financial Position, subsequently they are remeasured and held at their fair values.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.
Fair value hierarchy Level 1: Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
84 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written-off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Forward funded pre-let investments The Group enters into forward funding agreements for pre-let investments.
Forward funded prepayments Under the terms of certain Development Funding Agreements, the Group may choose to pay the total fixed price construction cost to the developer upon entering into the Agreement, which is to be held in a restricted bank account.
This will be classified as a forward funded prepayment on the Group Statement of Financial Position.
As construction costs are incurred, funds are released subject to the authorisation of the Groups subsidiary that has contracted the development, along with appropriate monitoring surveyor sign off.
Accordingly, the initial amount paid into the restricted bank account shown as a forward funded prepayment, will reduce as construction costs are incurred and funds are released from the restricted account and capitalised accordingly.
Licence fees receivable During the period between initial investment in a forward funded agreement and the rent commencement date, the Group receives licence fee income.
This is payable by the developer to the Group throughout this period and typically reflects the approximate level of rental income that is expected to be payable under the lease, as and when practical completion is reached.
Under IFRS such licence fees are deducted from the cost of the investment and are shown as a receivable.
Any economic benefit of the licence fee is reflected within the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income as a movement in the fair value of investment property and not within gross rental income.
Cash held at bank Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash held at bank also includes amounts held in restricted accounts to cover future rentfree periods: this is not available for everyday use.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at their fair value: being at their invoiced value inclusive of any VAT that may be applicable.
Payables are subsequently measured at cost.
4.11.1 Bank borrowings All bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of attributable transaction costs.
Any attributable transaction costs relating to the issue of the bank borrowings are amortised through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument on a straight-line basis.
After initial recognition, all bank borrowings are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
4.11.2 Refinancing arrangements The Group accounts for refinancing exchanges with an existing lender by considering both quantitative and qualitative indicators of extinguishment or modifications.
Where the net present value of the future cash flows of the refinanced instrument do not differ from those of the existing instrument by more than 10%, the quantitative criteria are met to treat the exchange as a modification.
The indicators of qualitative factors as to modification or extinguishment are considered a judgement as referred to in 3.1.
Where an extinguishment exists the new instrument is recognised at fair value and the difference between that and the carrying value of the old instrument is recognised as a gain or loss in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 4.12.
Share-based payments The expense relating to share based payments is accrued over the period in which the service is received and is measured at the fair value of those services received.
The extent to which the expense is not settled at the reporting period end is transferred to a liability with a view that there is an expectation that the payment will be settled in cash.
Contingently issuable shares are treated as dilutive to the extent that based on market factors prevalent at the reporting period date the shares would be issuable.
Dividends payable to Shareholders Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the Shareholders at an Annual General Meeting.
Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on investment property is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in gross rental income in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
A rental adjustment is recognised from the rent review date in relation to unsettled rent reviews, where the Directors are reasonably certain that the rental uplift will be agreed.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.
For leases, which contain fixed or minimum uplifts, the rental income arising from such uplifts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Tenant lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease where, at the inception of the lease, the Directors are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.
Amounts received from tenants to terminate leases or to compensate for dilapidations are recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income when the right to receive them arises.
Service charges, insurances and other expenses recoverable from tenants Income arising from expenses recharged to tenants is recognised in the period in which the compensation becomes receivable.
Service and insurance charges and other such receipts are included in net rental income gross of the related costs, as the Directors consider that the Group acts as principal in this respect.
Finance income Finance income is recognised as interest accrues on cash balances held by the Group.
Interest charged to a tenant on any overdue rental income is also recognised within finance income.
Finance costs Finance costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with bank and other borrowings.
Any finance costs that are separately identifiable and directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that takes a period of time to complete are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
All other finance costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
Taxation Taxation on the profit or loss for the period not exempt under UK REIT regulations comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

INVESTMENT PROPERTY In accordance with IAS 40: Investment Property, the investment property has been independently valued at fair value by CBRE Limited CBRE, an accredited independent valuer with a recognised and relevant professional qualification and with recent experience in the locations and categories of the investment properties being valued.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards January 2014 the Red Book and incorporate the recommendations of the International Valuation Standards Committee which are consistent with the principles set out in IFRS 13.
The Valuer in forming its opinion make a series of assumptions, which are typically market related such as net initial yields and expected rental values and are based on the Valuers professional judgement.
The Valuer has sufficient current local and national knowledge of the particular property markets involved and has the skills and understanding to undertake the valuations competently.
The valuations are the ultimate responsibility of the Directors.
Accordingly, the critical assumptions used in establishing the independent valuation are reviewed by the Board.
All corporate acquisitions during the year have been treated as asset purchases rather than business combinations because they are considered to be acquisitions of properties rather than businesses.

This balance arises as a result of the IFRS treatment of leases with fixed or minimal rental uplifts and rent-free periods, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The difference between this and cash receipts change the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.

The valuations have been prepared on the basis of Market Value MV, which is defined in the RICS Valuation Standards, as: The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Market Value as defined in the RICS Valuation Standards is the equivalent of fair value under IFRS.
The following descriptions and definitions relating to valuation techniques and key unobservable inputs made in determining fair values are as follows: Valuation techniques: market comparable method Under the market comparable method or market comparable approach, a propertys fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions in the market.
Unobservable input: passing rent The rent at which space could be let in the market conditions prevailing at the date of valuation range: 838,500-5,490,254 per annum.
Unobservable input: rental growth The estimated average increase in rent based on both market estimations and contractual arrangements.
A reduction of the estimated future rental growth in the valuation model would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment property and an inflation of the estimated future rental growth would lead to an increase in the fair value.
No quantitative sensitivity analysis has been provided for estimated rental growth as a reasonable range would not result in a significant movement in fair value.
Unobservable input: net initial yield The net initial yield is defined as the initial gross income as a percentage of the market value or purchase price as appropriate plus standard costs of purchase range: 4.25%-7.00%.
Sensitivities of measurement of significant unobservable inputs As set out within significant accounting estimates and judgements above, the Groups property portfolio valuation is open to judgements and is inherently subjective by nature.

The facilities are secured against individual investment properties, the asset owning entities and certain intermediary holding companies of those subsidiaries.
On 2 October 2015, the Group agreed a new 500 million secured debt facility with a syndicate of four lenders: Barclays Bank PLC, Helaba, Wells Fargo Bank N. A. and ING Real Estate Finance UK B. V. The facility comprises a 320 million term loan, which was drawn immediately, a further 80 million term loan and a 100 million revolving credit facility.
The revolving credit facility included an overdraft component of 10 million.
As at the year end, the Group has drawn 350 million under this facility.
The facility is fully cross-collateralised against a portfolio of assets, the asset owning entities and certain intermediary holding companies.
The Company provides a full guarantee on behalf of each obligor in respect of each and every lender.
The Group used proceeds from the syndicated facility to refinance 253.3 million of its bilateral debt arrangements, which had been provided by Barclays and Santander.
Its existing loans with Helaba remain outside the facility and are unaffected.
There were no early redemption charges payable on any of the loans that were refinanced.
Each of the Groups debt facilities has an interest charge which is payable quarterly based on a margin above 3 month Libor.
The weighted average margin payable by the Group on its debt portfolio as at the year end was 1.42% 2014: 1.76% above 3 month Libor.
The Group has been in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the above facilities as applicable throughout the year covered by these financial statements.
Any associated fees in arranging the bank borrowings unamortised as at the period end are offset against amounts drawn on the facilities as shown in the table below: 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 000 000 385,041 203,644 Bank borrowings drawn: due in more than one year 7,406 2,711 Less: Unamortised costs 377,635 200,933 Non-current liabilities: Bank borrowings 96 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 Maturity of bank borrowings 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 000 000 Repayable between 1 and 2 years Repayable between 2 and 5 years 385,041 203,644 Repayable in over 5 years 385,041 203,644 The weighted average term to maturity of the Groups debt as at the year end is 4.67 years.
The syndicated facility has two, one-year extension options, exercisable after years one and two respectively.
One of the bilateral facilities also has a one-year extension option exercisable after the first year.
All of the options require lender consent, when taking these into account the weighted average term to maturity, for the Group, assuming all options were exercised, would be 6.51 years.
INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES To mitigate the interest rate risk that arises as a result of entering into variable rate linked loans, the Group entered into a number of interest rate derivatives during the year.
Interest rate caps and an interest rate swap have been taken out in respect of each loan drawn to cap the rate to which 3 month Libor can rise, with each running coterminous to the initial term of the respective loans.
The weighted average capped rate of Libor for the Group as at the year end was 1.52% 2014: 2.09%, which effectively caps the Groups drawn borrowing facilities at an all-inclusive interest rate payable of 2.94% 2014: 3.85%.
The total premium payable in the year towards securing the interest rate caps was 8.32 million.

There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during any of the periods, nor have there been any transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during any of the periods.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial instruments The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities are those that arise directly from its operations: trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups other principal financial liabilities are bank borrowings, the main purpose of which is to finance the acquisition and development of the Groups investment property portfolio.
Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial information: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2015 2015 2014 2014 000 000 000 000 Financial assets 8,635 8,635 2,379 2,379 Interest rate derivatives 1 6,786 6,786 3,447 3,447 Trade and other receivables 68,586 68,586 98,616 98,616 Cash held at bank Financial liabilities 2 24,176 24,176 4,484 4,484 Trade and other payables 385,041 385,041 203,644 203,644 Bank borrowings 1 Excludes VAT certain prepayments, other debtors and forward funded prepayments.
2 Excludes tax and VAT liablities.
Interest rate derivatives are the only financial instruments classified at fair value through profit and loss.
All other financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
All financial instruments were 98 designated in their current categories upon initial recognition.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Tritax Big Box REIT plc Annual Report 2015 Risk management The Group is exposed to market risk including interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors oversees the management of these risks.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks that are summarised below.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair values of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The financial instruments held by the Group that are affected by market risk are principally the Groups cash balances, bank borrowings along with a number of interest rate derivatives entered into to mitigate interest rate risk.
The Group monitors its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
A sensitivity analysis performed to ascertain the impact on profit or loss and net assets of a 50 basis point shift in interest rates would result in an increase of 1.53 million or a decrease of 1.19 million.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risks from both its leasing activities and financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Credit risk is assisted by tenants being required to pay rentals in advance under their lease obligations.
The credit quality of the tenant is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard at the time of entering into a lease agreement.
Outstanding trade receivables are regularly monitored.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial asset.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, primarily tenant rentals, are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables and are monitored on a case by case basis.
Credit risk is primarily managed by requiring tenants to pay rentals in advance and performing tests around strength of covenant prior to acquisition.
Any rentals past due as at the period end were received shortly after the year end.
Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises with the banks and financial institutions.
The Board of Directors believes that the credit risk on short-term deposits and current account cash balances are limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and, going forward, the finance charges, principal repayments on its borrowings and its commitments under forward funded development arrangements.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due, as the majority of the Groups assets are property investments and are therefore not readily realisable.
The Groups objective is to ensure it has sufficient available funds for its operations and to fund its capital expenditure.
This is achieved by continuous monitoring of forecast and actual cash flows by management ensuring it has appropriate levels of cash and available drawings to meet liabilities as they fall due.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 31 December 2015 Bank borrowings 1,947 5,842 413,599 421,388 Trade and other payables 24,176 24,176 26,123 5,842 413,599 445,564 31 December 2014 Bank borrowings 1,180 3,539 219,243 223,962 Trade and other payables 4,484 4,484 5,664 3,539 219,243 228,446 Included within the contracted payments is 36.35 million 2014: 20.32 million of bank interest payable up to the point of maturity across the facilities.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it remains a going concern and continues to qualify for UK REIT status.
The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, monitors and reviews the Groups capital so as to promote the long-term success of the business, facilitate expansion and to maintain sustainable returns for Shareholders.
The Group considers proceeds from share issuances, bank borrowings and retained earnings as capital.
The Groups policy on borrowings is as set out below: The level of borrowing will be on a prudent basis for the asset class, and will seek to achieve a low cost of funds, while maintaining flexibility in the underlying security requirements, and the structure of both the portfolio and the REIT Group.
The Directors intend that the Group will maintain a conservative level of aggregate borrowings with a medium-term target of 40% of the Groups gross assets.
However, during the investment phase post admission, the Groups target level of aggregate borrowings will be 45% of the Groups gross assets.
The Group has complied with all covenants on its borrowings up to the date of this report.
All of the targets mentioned above sit comfortably within the Groups covenant levels which would include loan value, interest cover ratio and loan to projected project cost ratio.
Debt is secured at the asset and corporate level, subject to the assessment of the optimal financing structure for the Group and having consideration to key metrics including lender diversity, debt type and maturity profiles.
