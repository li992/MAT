ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Segmental analysis The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on management accounts reviewed by the Board.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding equity settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment and unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The activities, products and services of the operating segments are detailed in the Strategic Report on page 22.
The Property Management segment holds properties and property leases which are sub-let to other segments and external parties.

The liability of 73.9m is recorded in the January 2015 balance sheet on the basis that it could not realistically have been cancelled after the exdividend date and it was paid on 2 February 2015.
It is intended that this years ordinary final dividend of 100p per share will be paid to shareholders on 3 August 2015.
NEXT plc shares will trade exdividend from 9 July 2015 and the record date will be 10 July 2015.
The estimated amount payable is 148.4m.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The Trustee of the ESOT has waived dividends paid in the year on shares held by the ESOT.
Earnings per share 2015 2014 Basic earnings per share Total 428.3p 366.1p Underlying 419.8p 366.1p Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the parent company and the weighted average number of shares ranking for dividend less the weighted average number of shares held by the ESOT during the period.
Underlying earnings per share is based on profit before the exceptional gains described in Note 6.
2015 2014 Diluted earnings per share Total 417.9p 355.6p Underlying 409.7p 355.6p Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic earnings per share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive shares arise from employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the equivalent number of nilcost options.
Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
There were 0.7m such share options in the current year 2014: nil.

Earnings per share continued 2015 2014 Fully diluted earnings per share Total 409.6p 347.1p Underlying 401.5p 347.1p Fully diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic earnings per share, increased by the weighted average total employee share options outstanding during the period.
Fully diluted earnings per share is used for the purposes of the Share Matching Plan, described further in the Remuneration Report.

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the following cash generating units: 2015 2014 m m NEXT Sourcing 30.5 30.5 Lipsy 12.1 12.0 42.6 42.5 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date on the basis of value in use.
As this exceeded carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised 2014: nil.
NEXT Sourcing The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 10% 2014: 10%.
Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for next year were used and extrapolated for nine further years using a growth rate of 2% 2014: 2% and discounted at 12% 2014: 12%.
The key assumption is that Lipsy will continue to trade profitably through its different sales channels.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there was no impairment.

Pension benefits The Groups UK pension arrangements include defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The Group also provides unfunded retirement benefits to some plan members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the lifetime allowance.
Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds which have equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex and comply with the Employment Equality Regulations 2006.
Further information on the Groups pension arrangements is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 and 55.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and over recent years the Group has taken steps to manage the on-going risks associated with it: In 2010, most pensions in payment were subject to a buy-in contract with an insurance company.
This was followed in 2012 by a further buy-in contract for pensions that had come into payment since 2010: From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on pensionable earnings frozen at that time, rather than final earnings.
Those employees receive either additional contributions to the defined contribution section, or a salary supplement: To enable future conversion of the buy-in to buy-out, in 2013 a new Plan was established for members whose pensions are not insured through the buy-in contracts and the associated assets and liabilities were transferred across.
It is intended that the pensions and matching insurance contracts held by the original Plan will be converted to buy-out and the original Plan will then be dissolved.

Pension benefits continued The following table summarises the principal risks associated with the Groups defined benefit arrangements: Investment Risk The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
To the extent that the return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate, the pension surplus may reduce and a deficit may emerge.
Interest Rate Risk A fall in bond yields would increase the value of the liabilities.
This would be only partially offset by an increase in the value of bond investments held.
Inflation Risk An increase in inflation would increase the value of pension liabilities.
Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities is calculated having regards to a best estimate of the mortality of plan members.

A decrease of 0.25% in the discount rates used would increase the gross liabilities by approximately 37m, which would be partly mitigated by an increase of approximately 5m on the insurance assets.
An increase of 0.25% in the inflation assumption would increase the gross liabilities by 24m, offset by an increase of approximately 3m on the insurance assets.
Members of the defined benefit section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings whilst the employer contribution rate is 17.5%.
Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings which is matched by the employing company.

Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as follows: Management share options The NEXT Management Share Option Plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.
No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme and be included in NEXTs LTIP or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits.
There are no cash settlement alternatives and they are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled awards.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
Sharesave options The Companys Save As You Earn Sharesave scheme is open to all employees.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules.
The current maximum monthly savings limit for the schemes detailed below is 250.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three or five years from the date of grant.
Sharesave options are also accounted for as equity settled awards under IFRS 2.

The SMP is an equity-settled scheme.
Prior to January 2014, all LTIP awards were accounted for as cashsettled share based payments.
From January 2014 onwards, new LTIP grants to executive directors will be settled in shares with no cash settlement alternative.
Those awards are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled.
Awards to other senior executives and legacy awards to executive directors will continue to be treated as cash-settled.
From January 2014, executive directors are no longer granted SMP awards.
Performance conditions for SMP and LTIP awards are detailed in the Remuneration Report.

Fair value calculations The fair value of Management, Sharesave and SMP options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 24 January 2015 and 25 January 2014 based on information at the date of grant: Management share options granted in April 2015 2014 Share price at date of grant 66.95 41.70 Exercise price 66.95 41.70 Volatility 21.7% 24.7% Expected life 4 years 4 years Risk free rate 1.60% 0.45% Dividend yield 1.64% 2.24% Weighted average fair value per option 10.73 6.38 109 23849.04 8 April 2015 7:29 AM Proof 4 Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015 plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25.

Shares held by ESOT The NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT has an independent trustee resident in Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at the discretion of the Trustee.
All Management and Sharesave options which were exercised during the year were satisfied by shares issued from the ESOT.
At 24 January 2015 the ESOT held 5,010,614 2014: 6,190,747 ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the market value of which amounted to 358.3m 2014: 388.8m.
Details of outstanding share options are shown in Note 25.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 24 January 2015 and 25 January 2014 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the Group.
All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the Company and the Group.

Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

None of this facility was drawn down at January 2015 2014: nil.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.
Interest rates: fair value hedges The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys corporate bonds.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 20.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 53.9 16.8 The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities continued Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.
This hedging activity involves, inter alia, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 30.
Foreign currency hedges The fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows: 2015 2014 m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 53.7 20.0 Other foreign exchange derivatives 4.7 4.2 Total foreign exchange derivatives 58.4 24.2 The total notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2015 2014 m m US Dollar 1,066.1 752.8 Euro 163.6 64.8 Other 28.3 8.2 1,258.0 825.8 Prior to its disposal, the Group had entered agreements to supply its associated company, Cotton Traders, with US Dollars.
The notional value of contracts outstanding at January 2015 was 13.2m 2014: 22.8m.
Credit risk Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
Concentrations of risk are mitigated by the use of various counterparties at any one time.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 14.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 31, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends including special dividends.
Share buybacks are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.

Market values include accrued interest and changes in credit risk and interest rate risk, and are therefore different to the reported carrying amounts.
Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis continued Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 0.5% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between one month and approximately 25 years.
Contingent rentals are payable on certain retail store leases based on store revenues.
The majority of the Groups property leases provide for their renewal by mutual agreement at the expiry of the lease term.
