Segment Information continued 5.2 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
5.3 Research & development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Capitalised development expenditure in 2015 was nil 2014: nil.

Restructuring Charges The 2015 restructuring charges were 14.6m 2014: nil.
During the year a Group-wide restructuring programme was initiated resulting in charges of 15.5m 2014: nil reflecting redundancy costs of 13.6m, plant closure costs of 1.3m, and consultancy fees of 0.6m.
This was partially offset by a release of onerous lease provisions of 0.5m 2014: nil and a 0.4m 2014: nil release of provisions for potential claims that have now expired relating to the termination of agents.
The net tax credit attributable to the total restructuring charges was 1.5m 2014: nil.

In 2014, profit on disposal of continuing operations comprised 0.8m profit on the sale of non-current assets in the USA and Czech Republic, and a 0.4m loss on the dilution of interests in an investment holding in Italy.
Net Finance Costs 10.1 Accounting policy Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Capitalised borrowing costs for 2015 were nil 2014: nil.
Allother borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

Income Tax 11.1 Accounting policy Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate toitems charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax isalso dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items ofincome or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future as effective tax relief may not beavailable for those losses or expenses.
Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in Notes 3.4 and 11.1.

The substantial increase 21.8m in the total deferred tax asset recognised in respect of those US attributes in 2014 reflected our increased confidence in their future realisation.
We remain confident of the recovery of this asset.
It is now expected that part of the US deferred tax asset will be realised in respect of US pension costs which are reflected directly in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
That tax credit has therefore also been reflected in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in 2015.
There is a consequent 3.3m net reduction of that asset recognised in the Group income statement.
In view of its material size and nature, any tax credit reflected in the Group income statement arising from the recognition of this asset is presented separately from the tax charge on headline performance, in accordance with the principles outlined in Note 2.5 above.
Subsequent increase, decrease and amortisation of the resultant deferred tax asset would similarly be expected to be presented in this manner, as the Directors consider that the separate identification of deferred tax for material temporary differences would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved, and in making projections of future results of the Group.
Tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences of 1.3m 2014: 2.1m were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss.
On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the Directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
The total deferred tax assets not recognised as at 31 December 2015 were 256.7m 2014: 259.3m, as analysed below.
In accordance with the accounting policy in Note 11.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable.
In total, there was a decrease of 2.6m 2014: 20.7m in net unrecognised deferred tax assets duringthe year.

The above losses available relating to the Rest of the World arise in a number of countries, each of which is not individually significant, reflecting the spread of the Groups operations.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had US tax credits carried forward with a tax value of 2.4m 2014: 2.0m as follows: 2015 2014 m m US research and experimentation credits due to expire 2018 to 2033 1.3 1.1 US foreign tax credits due to expire 2022 to 2024 1.1 0.9 US tax credits 2.4 2.0 There are no temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised.
Further UK corporation tax rate reductions to 19% from1April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020, were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
Accordingly, the Groups closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 18% except where the reversals are expected to arise prior to 1 April 2020.
Theimpact of using this lower tax rate was included in 2015 and increased the exceptional tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets by 0.8m.

Property, Plant and Equipment 16.1 Accounting policy Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure arecharged to the Group income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Asset category Estimated useful life Freehold property between ten and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles and information technology equipment between one and five years other between three and 15 years The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and changed, if appropriate.
As described inNote 18.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group incomestatement.

Intangible Assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
17.1 Accounting policy a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual orother legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably.
They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition-date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets 18.1 Accounting policy The Directors regularly review the performance of the business and the external business environment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the higher of the value in use and the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying value in order to determine the extent, ifany, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount ofthe CGU to which the asset belongs.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of each CGU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of the associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii itsvalue in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets continued 18.2 Key assumptions The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, growth rates and discount rates.
Return on sales assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on three-year business plans and a terminal value at 2.5% growth rate.
The cash flows are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates, which represent each CGUs weighted average cost of capital WACC.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key end-markets of Steel and Foundry: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2014: 2.5% has been applied.
The pre-tax discount rate is the WACC calculated for each CGU as at 31 December 2015 based on industry-specific beta coefficients for the industries in which the CGUs operate, risk-free rates, and equity risk premia related to the major countries in which the CGUs are located, selecting countries which contribute at least 80% of total CGU revenue.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel CGU was 11.1% 2014: 10.3% and for the Foundry CGU was 13.0% 2014:15.0%.
The increase in Steels pre-tax discount rate is driven by increasing contributions from emerging markets, which carry higher risk free rates and equity risk premium assumptions.
The decrease in Foundrys pre-tax discount rate is due to the inclusion of a wider range of end-market industries used in the volatility assumption beyond just machinery and automotive industries to ensure the systematic risk coverage reflects the portfolio of the Foundry business globally.
Under a sensitivity analysis undertaken on the 2015 impairment testing, a 1.0% increase in each of the CGU discount rates and a 1.0% perpetuity growth rate still left each CGU with headroom of recoverable amount over its carryingvalue.
A pre-tax WACC of 15.9% would result in an impairment of Foundry intangible assets and 14.1% for Steel.
18.3 Goodwill impairment In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2015, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2015.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.

Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions aremaintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees.
All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet.
Such arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group balance sheet included 4.7m 2014: 5.9m of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place.
The movement since the prior year of 1.2m is due to the ongoing retirement of the debt factoring programme.
Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2015, which are charged to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to 0.2m 2014: 0.6m.

Inventories 20.1 Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in, first out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

The net inventories of 168.0m includes a provision for obsolete stock of 11.0m 2014: 12.8m.
Derivative Financial Instruments 21.1 Accounting policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage the effects ofits exposure to foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage theGroups financial risk is detailed in Note 28.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change infair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised immediately in theGroup income statement.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, orwithin finance costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
When the transaction that was being hedged isrealised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised inthe income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within trading profit inthe Group income statement.
Net investment hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal ofthe net investment.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the Group income statement.

The 25.1m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, comprised 24.4m paid for current year acquisitions, less 0.6m of cash acquired with current year acquisitions and a release of contingent consideration payment for ECIL Met Tec and Process Metrix 0.8m and 0.5m respectively.
These acquisitions contributed 7.5m of revenue, and a 0.6m trading loss to the Groups results.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015, the contribution would have been 12.9m of revenue, and a trading loss of 0.6m.
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 0.1m relating to external legal fees and due diligence costs which have been included within administration costs in the Group income statement.
The goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributable to the synergies which are expected from combining Sidermes, a complementary business, with the operations of the Group.
Discontinued Operations The net cash outflow from discontinued operations of 6.2m during 2015 represented the net payment of 5.5m to MacDermid following the settlement agreement in 2014, 0.4m VAT recovered, and 0.3m other payments.
Discontinued operations income of 1.4m related to a partial reimbursement of costs charged in 2014 for the MacDermid claim.
Discontinued operations in 2014 comprise of a release of 1.1m of provision relating to a VAT case which was resolved in Vesuvius favour and a charge of 4.7m in relation to settlement of actions brought by MacDermid incorporated in the United States against Vesuvius and Alent plc that arose out of corporate activity between the parties in 2006.

After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pound sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising onthe settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pound sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does notapproximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal ofthe net investment.
28.2 Financial risk factors The Groups treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Groups financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.
The Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets.
This is achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts FX swaps.
The currency profile of the Groups borrowings and financial assets, reflecting the effect of the FX swaps, isshownin the table overleaf.

Financial risk management continued 28.2 Financial risk factors continued a Market risk continued Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings.
Where borrowings are held at floating rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash flows associated with its interest payments and where borrowings are held at fixed rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had $310m and 30m 232.4m in total of US Private Placement Loan Notes outstanding, which carry a fixed rate of interest, representing two-thirds of the Groups total borrowings outstanding at that date.

The financial assets attract floating rate interest atthe inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin.
Based upon the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.6m 2014: 0.5m and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.6m 2014: 0.5m.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 11.0m 2014: 14.1m in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 11.8m 2014: 11.6m in the fair value of the Groups net debt.

The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants.
Thelevel of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three-year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance bymeans of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 532.4m 2014: 647.4m, of which 181.1m 2014:343.5m were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in June 2020.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by USPrivate Placement Loan Notes USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of 300m 2014: 425m.
The syndicated bank facility is repayable in June 2020.
The maturity analysis of the Groups gross borrowings is shown in the tables below.

Financial risk management continued 28.3 Capital management The Company considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt.
It monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and RONA Note 4.
TheGroups objectives when managing its capital are: To ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns toinvestors To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events To maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt.
The Group operated within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has sufficient liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found inthe Strategic Report on page 37 to 38.
28.4 Cash pooling arrangements The Group enters into notional cash pooling arrangements as part of its ongoing treasury management activities.
Certain cash pooling arrangements meet the criteria for offsetting as clarified in Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments, as regards a legally enforceable right of set off both in the ordinary course of business and in the event of default.
The following tables set out the amounts of recognised financial assets and liabilities shown as cash and cash borrowings and those amounts which are subject to these agreements.

Employee benefits 29.1 Accounting policy The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Groups defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the asset ceiling, where this is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions in respect of the plans.
The expense for the Groups defined benefit plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in Note 29.8.
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise tothe settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of operating profit.
29.2 Group post-retirement plans The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
The Groups principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US, the benefits of which are based upon the final pensionable salaries of plan members.
The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The principal risks faced by these plans comprise: i the risk that the value of the plan assets is not sufficient to meet all plan liabilities as they fall due: ii the risk that plan beneficiaries live longer than envisaged, causing liabilities to exceed the available plan assets: and iii the risk that the market-based factors used to value plan liabilities change materially adversely to increase plan liabilities over the value of available plan assets.
The Group also has defined benefit pension plans inother territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
a Defined benefit pension plans UK The Groups main defined benefit pension plan in the UK the UK Plan is closed to new members and to future benefit accrual.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2012.
At that date, the market value of plan assets was 501.9m and this represented a funding level of 102% of the accrued plan benefits at the time of 490.4m.
Calculated on a buyout basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 610.1m, representing a funding level of 82%.
Under the rules of the UK Plan, the Trustee has the power to set the funding contributions, having consulted with the Company.
Under a schedule of contributions agreed by the Company and Trustee, the Company made top-up payments of 7.0m per annum up to July 2013, after which they ceased as a result of the funding surplus evidenced by the 2012 funding valuation.
The level of top-up payments will be reviewed based on the UK Plans next triennial valuation as at 31 December 2015, which should be available in mid-2016.
Notwithstanding the latest funding valuation surplus, the Company has agreed to make voluntary contributions of 2.0m per annum until the next valuation date.
In July 2012, the UK Plan Trustee entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation PIC, whereby the UK Plan Trustee paid an insurance premium of 318.8m to PIC to insure a significant portion of the UK Plans liabilities.
In December 2012, the PIC buy-in agreement was extended, under which the UK Plan Trustee agrees to transfer to PIC all new pensioner liabilities arising from July 2012 to December 2015 limited to 30m in exchange for a premium payment from the assets of the UK Plan based on the pricing terms of the original buy-in agreement, but reflecting changes in market conditions and differences in the duration of the liabilities transferred.
As part of this extension to the buy-in agreement, in May 2014 and April 2015 the UK Plan Trustee paid an additional 12.4m and 7.4m of insurance premium respectively to PIC from the assets of the UK plan to cover new retirees between inception and 31 December 2014.
Under this arrangement, the value of the PIC insurance contract matches the value of the liabilities because the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities are eliminated.
As at end December 2015, the IAS 19 valuation of the PIC insurance contract value associated with the bought-in liabilities was 265.3m 2014: 281.3m.
The IAS 19 valuation of the pension liabilities uses a higher discount rate than that used for funding valuation purposes and hence generates a lower value for the bought-in liabilities which implies a lower accounting valuation of the PIC insurance contract compared to the actual premium paid to PIC.
Consequently the reduction in asset portfolio valuation is reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income, not the income statement based onIAS19requirements.
The buy-in agreement ensures that 57% of UK pension plan obligations are insured, removing all financial risks associated with this tranche of the liability.
148 Vesuvius plc Section Five Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29.
Employee benefits continued 29.2 Group post-retirement plans continued a Defined benefit pension plans UK continued The value of the UK Plan liabilities decreased to 464.3m 2014: 506.3m.
The decrease in the liabilities is driven mainly by the change in financial assumptions including a decrease in the long-term inflation expectations in the UK and an increase in discount rates to 3.75% in 2015 2014: 3.5%.
Correspondingly, the UK Plan assets decreased to 522.0m 2014: 555.1m mainly driven by the loss on plan assets excluding interest income of 21.7m.
Proposed amendments to IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, address how the powers of other parties, such as the Trustees of the plan, affect an entitys right to a refund of a surplus from the plan.
The Group has assessed the likely impact of the application of this interpretation and concluded that it would not impact its ability to continue to recognise a pension surplus in the UK.
b Defined benefit pension plans US The Group has a number of defined benefit pension plans in the US, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit.
The Groups principal US defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members.
Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2015.
At that date the market value of the plan assets was 74.4m, representing a funding level of 73% of funded accrued plan benefits at that date using the projected unit method of valuation of 101.6m.
Funding levels for the Groups US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by USGovernment regulations.
The value of US plan liabilities increased to 112.1m 2014: 111.8m, which was mainly driven by exchange losses partially offset by increases in discount rates to 3.9% 2014: 3.7% and changes to demographic assumptions, which had a net impact of increasing the liability by 1.3m.
c Defined benefit pension plans Germany The Group has a number of defined benefit pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
The net liability of the German plans at 31 December 2015 was 36.3m 2014: 39.9m.
The decrease was mainly driven by increases in the discount rate assumption, which decreased the liability by 2.6m.
Part of the main plan was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2015 and replaced by a defined contribution plan for new joiners.
d Defined benefit pension plans ROW The Group has a number of defined benefit pension arrangements across the rest of the world, the majority of which are located in Belgium.
The net liability of the ROW plans at 31 December 2015 was 13.3m 2014: 19.0m.
The decrease was mainly influenced by the completion of a triennial valuation of the Belgian plans, which led to experience gains of 3.0m attributed to benefits paid out over the last three years.
e Defined contribution pension plans The total expense for the Groups defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to 10.7m 2014: 9.2m continuing operations and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
f Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, Vesuvius in the US participates together with other enterprises in union run multi-employer pension plans for temporary workers hired on sites.
Some of these plans are underfunded and all participating employers are ultimately liable for any deficit.
If a participating employer stops contributing to a plan it is required to make a withdrawal payment to the plan to cover its share of the total deficit in the plan.
No reliable basis exists for allocation of the plans obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants.
Deficits in the plans may necessitate increased contributions in the future.
These are currently accounted for as defined contribution plans.
In 2015 Vesuvius contributed 1.1m 2014: 1.7m to these plans.
Employee benefits continued 29.3 Post-retirement liability valuation The main assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension plans, as detailed below, areset by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
a Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups UK, US and German defined benefit pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS All table, with future longevity improvements in line with the core mortality improvement tables published in 2014 by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum.
For the Groups US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP-2015 fully generational tables with projection scale BB, and the MP-2015 mortality improvement scale.
The Groups major plans in Germany have been valued using the Heubeck-Richttafein 2005G mortality tables.

The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the Aon Hewitt AA-rated corporate bond yield in conjunction with the most recent projected cash flow data relating to the UK Plan liabilities: the US discount rate is based on the Citigroup pension discount curve: and the Germany discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over ten-year euro corporates AAindex.
The assumptions for UK price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 1.1 points lower 2014: 1.0 point lower than RPI-basedinflation.
c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in significant IAS 19 actuarial assumptions The following table analyses, for the Groups main UK, US and Germany pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from changes to the most significant actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Following the arrangement of buy-in agreements for the UK plan pensioner liabilities in 2012, as noted above, and the fact that USpensions are not inflation linked, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries and of pensions in payment is not significant to thevaluation of the Groups overall pension liabilities.
150 Vesuvius plc Section Five Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 29.
Employee benefits continued 29.3 Post-retirement liability valuation continued c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in significant IAS 19 actuarial assumptions continued As stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into pension insurance buy-in agreements which eliminate the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreements.
Therefore, for the liabilities so covered, which represent some 57% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions which impact the value of those liabilities, also impact on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk.
This is also reflected in the following table.

The average duration of the obligations to which the liabilities of the Groups principal pension plans relate is 19 years for the UK, 19 years for Germany and 12 years for the US.

In addition, the UK Plan holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which reduces the risk that the UK Plans assets would fall materially, relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
b Defined benefit contributions in 2016 In 2016, the Group is expected to make contributions into its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefits plans of around 8.7m.
This is subject to triennial valuations to be carried out during 2016, which may result in reduced contributions to the UK plan.

Share-based payments 30.1 Income statement recognition The total expense recognised in the Group income statement is shown below.
2015 2014 m m Long Term Incentive Plan 0.6 0.8 Other plans 0.7 1.5 Total expense 0.1 2.3 The Group operates a number of different share-based payment plans, the most significant of which is the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, details of which can be found between pages 88 to 90 of the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Groups other share-based payment plans are not considered significant in the context of the Groups results or financial position.
The decrease in the share based payment expense in 2015 is due to the departure of Chris OShea as CFO in September 2015 resulting in his share options being forfeited, the vesting assumptions for share options being lowered and fewer shares being granted in 2015 in comparison to 2014.

Leases 32.1 Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
32.2 Operating lease commitments The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: 2015 2014 m m Not later than one year 8.2 7.5 Later than one year and not later than five years 13.7 15.3 Later than five years 2.3 4.7 Total operating lease commitments 24.2 27.5 The Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2015 was 3.8m 2014: 4.0m.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, amounted to 11.8m 2014: 12.7m.
Provisions 33.1 Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
33.2 Analysis of provisions Disposal and closure Restructuring costs charges Other Total m m m m As at 1 January 2015 30.4 8.0 14.3 52.7 Exchange adjustments 1.4 0.1 1.5 Net charge to Group income statement 14.6 9.2 23.8 Unwind of discount 0.9 0.1 1.0 Cash spend 2.0 11.5 18.6 32.1 Transferred to from other balance sheet accounts 1.4 1.6 0.2 As at 31 December 2015 30.7 9.8 6.6 47.1 Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2015 of 47.1m 2014: 52.7m, 29.5m 2014: 31.9m is recognised in the Group balance sheet within non-current liabilities and 17.6m 2014: 20.8m within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next ten years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Provisions continued 33.2 Analysis of provisions continued The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Groups initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
The balance of 9.8m as at 31 December 2015 comprises 3.3m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between one and seven years, and 6.5m in relation to expenditure on restructuring initiatives that have been announced which is expected to be paid out over the nextyear.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal orother regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
During 2015 the Group recognised net charges of 9.2m 2014: 5.8m in the income statement to provide for various litigation settlements and other claims.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its realisation is virtually certain.
As at 31 December 2015, 12.3m 2014: 11.4m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which 9.7m 2014: 9.0m is non-current.
Off-balance sheet arrangements In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are: future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases Note 32.
Contingent liabilities Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to 1.7m 2014: 2.3m.
Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in Note 10 to the Company financial statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of Vesuvius subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising inthe ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty see Note 33 for further information.
Certain of Vesuvius subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius.
These suits usually also name many other product manufacturers.
To date, Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius financial position or results of operations.
