When calculating these sensitivities the same method has been applied to calculate the fide ned bene t obligation as has been applied when calculating the liability recognised in the balance sheet.
This methodology is the same as prior periods.
Share-based payments The Group recognised the following charges in the income statement in respect of its equity-settled share-based payment plans: All gures in millions 2015 2014 Pearson plans 26 32 Share-based payment charges included in discontinued operations amounted to 3m 2014: 3m.
The Group operates the following equity-settled employee option and share plans: Worldwide Save for Shares Plan Since 1994, the Group has operated a Save-As-You-Earn plan for UK employees.
In 1998, the Group introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthly salary over periods of three or five years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the end of the savings period lapse unconditionally.

Share-based payments continued Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees in the US to save a portion of their monthly salary over six-month periods.
At the end of the period, the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was first introduced in 2001, renewed in 2006 and again in 2011.
The plan consists of restricted shares.
The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent on continuing service over a three to five-year period, and in the case of senior management upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three-year period.
These targets may be based on market and or non-market performance criteria.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in May 2014 and May 2015 vest dependent on relative total shareholder return, return on invested capital and earnings per share growth.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in November 2014 vest dependent on earnings per share growth.
Other restricted shares awarded in 2014 and 2015 vest depending on continuing service over a three-year period.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options granted under the Groups plans are as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise Number of exercise share options price share options price 000s 000s Outstanding at beginning of year 3,507 8.48 2,792 8.73 Granted during the year 1,024 11.49 1,985 8.11 Exercised during the year 578 8.78 727 8.24 Forfeited during the year 696 9.12 538 8.76 Expired during the year 7 8.85 5 7.43 Outstanding at end of year 3,250 9.24 3,507 8.48 Options exercisable at end of year 138 8.89 43 8.24 Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 11.86 2014: 11.41.
Early exercises arising from redundancy, retirement or death are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the Group therefore recognises in the income statement the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the original vesting period.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have weighted average remaining contractual lives and exercise prices as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted average average Number of contractual Number of contractual Range of exercise prices share options life share options life 000s Years 000s Years 05 510 2,361 2.08 3,507 2.68 10 889 3.26 3,250 2.40 3,507 2.68 In 2015 and 2014 options were granted under the Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
The weighted average estimated fair value for the options granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Share-based payments continued The weighted average estimated fair values and the inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted average average Fair value 1.99 2.41 Weighted average share price 13.37 11.09 Weighted average exercise price 11.49 8.11 Expected volatility 23.00% 21.27% Expected life 3.7 years 3.9 years Risk-free rate 0.90% 1.3% Expected dividend yield 4.44% 4.33% Forfeiture rate 3.2% 3.4% The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the companys share price over the previous three to seven years depending on the vesting term of the options.
The following shares were granted under restricted share arrangements: 2015 2014 Weighted Weighted Number of average fair Number of average fair shares value shares value 000s 000s Long-Term Incentive Plan 1,942 12.27 5,875 11.44 The fair value of shares granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan that vest unconditionally is determined using the share price at the date of grant.
The number of shares expected to vest is adjusted, based on historical experience, to account for potential forfeitures.
Restricted shares granted under the Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan are valued using the share price at the date of grant.
Participants under both plans are entitled to dividends during the vesting period and therefore the share price is not discounted.
Restricted shares with a market performance condition were valued by an independent actuary using a Monte Carlo model.
Restricted shares with a non-market performance condition were fair valued based on the share price at the date of grant.
Non-market performance conditions are taken into consideration by adjusting the number of shares expected to vest based on the most likely outcome of the relevant performance criteria.
