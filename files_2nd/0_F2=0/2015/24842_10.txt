2.4 OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEW As set out during the March 2013 share capital raising, the target long-term total return IRR was forecast to be approximately 7% per annum for shareholders, based on a share price of 119.5p.
For the period since 31 March 2014 until 31 March 2015, and from IPO until 31 March 2015, the total shareholder return has been 22.5% and 11.1% p. a. respectively, as measured by share price appreciation and dividends, or 15.4% and 9.7% p. a. respectively, as measured by Net Asset Value NAV appreciation and dividends.

Adjusting for the move to quarterly dividends, it was cash covered 1.34 times on a pro-forma basis in the year to 31 March 2015 2014: 1.5 times see Accounting below for further details.
This equates to a dividend yield of 4.7% based on the share price of 156.5p at 31 March 2015 2014: 5.2%.
