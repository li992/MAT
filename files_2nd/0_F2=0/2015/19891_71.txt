NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNILEVER GROUP CONTINUED 16.
TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING Derivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred.
The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.
a I FAIR VALUE HEDGES Certain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan.
In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement.
Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement.
The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective.
When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.
a II CASH FLOW HEDGES Derivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows.
Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships.
For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity.
Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset.
For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.
When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs.
When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement.
If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.
a III NET INVESTMENT HEDGES Certain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Groups investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.
IV DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED Derivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures.
No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.
a Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for both 2014 and 2015.
The Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections: liquidity risk see note 16A : market risk see note 16B : and credit risk see note 17B.
MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.
In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions.
A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Groups credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Groups ability to raise funds.
The Group maintained a cautious funding strategy, with a positive cash balance throughout 2015.
This was the result of cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances.
This cash has been invested conservatively with low risk counterparties at maturities of less than six months.
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes.
In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.
On 31 December 2015 Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of US$6,550 million 2014: US$6,550 million with a 364-day term out.
As part of the regular annual process the intention is that these facilities will again be renewed in 2016.

MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK Unilevers size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: commodity price risk: currency risk: and interest rate risk.
The above risks may affect the Groups income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.
Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.
The Groups exposure to, and management of, these risks is explained below.
It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 16C.
