Retirement bene t and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan in the UK, which is sectionalised to provide both fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution pension bene ts.
The fide ned bene t section was closed to new members from 1 November 2006.
The fide ned contribution section, opened in 2003, is open to new and existing employees.
Finally, there is a separate section within the UK Group plan set up for auto-enrolment.
The fide ned bene t section of the UK Group plan is a final salary pension plan which provides bene ts to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of bene ts depends on the length of service and final pensionable pay.
The UK Group plan is funded with bene t payments from trustee administered funds.
The UK Group plan is administered in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules in the interests of its bene ciaries by Pearson Group Pension Trustee Limited.
At 31 December 2015 the UK Group plan has approximately 25,000 members, analysed in the following table: All gures in % Active Deferred Pensioners Total fide ned bene t 127 3462 fide ned contribution 14 24 38 Total 15 51 34 100 Our business Our performance Our Social impact Governance Financial statements Section 5 Financial statements 191 25.
Retirement bene t and other post-retirement obligations continued Background continued The other major fide ned bene t plans are based in the US.
These are also final salary pension plans which provide bene ts to members in the form of a guaranteed pension payable for life, with the level of bene ts dependent on length of service and final pensionable pay.
The majority of the US plans are funded.
The Group also has several post-retirement medical bene t plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to fide ned bene t pension plans.
The fide ned bene t schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as life expectancy, in ation risks, and investment risk including asset volatility and changes in bond yields.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity speci c or plan speci c risks.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.
2015 2014 UK Group Other UK Group Other All gures in % plan plans PRMB plan plans PRMB In ation 3.1 2.5 2.5 3.0 2.5 2.5 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 3.7 4.0 4.0 3.6 3.7 3.7 Expected rate of increase in salaries 3.6 3.0 3.0 3.5 3.9 4.0 Expected rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 1.9 to 5.10 1.9 to 5.05 Initial rate of increase in healthcare rate 7.0 7.0 Ultimate rate of increase in healthcare rate 5.0 5.0 The UK discount rate is based on corporate bond yields adjusted to re ect the duration of liabilities.
The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The in ation rate for the UK Group plan of 3.1% re ects the RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation in 2010, certain bene ts have been calculated with reference to CPI as the in ationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.1% has been used.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 3.6% for 2015 with a short-term assumption of 2.0% for three years.
For the UK plan, the mortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to re ect the observed experience of the plan, with CMI model improvement factors.
A 1.5% long-term rate improvement on the CMI model is applied for both males and females.
For the US plans, the mortality table RP 2014 and 2014 Improvement scale MP 2014 with no adjustments have been adopted from 2014, re ecting the mortality assumption most prevalent in the US.

The trustee of the plan is required to act in the best interest of the plans bene ciaries.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2015 and this valuation revealed a technical provisions funding shortfall of 27m which was eliminated by contributions paid during 2015.
As a consequence of the disposal of the FT Group, an agreement has been made between Pearson and the Plan Trustee to accelerate the funding of the plan so that it becomes fully funded on a self-su ciency basis in the near future.
This is a much higher level of funding than technical provisions.
As a result the plan expects to be able to provide bene ts in accordance with the plan rules with a very low level of reliance on future funding from Pearson.
A commitment has also been made to maintain that level of funding in future years.
In addition to a substantial company contribution following the Penguin Random House merger to be paid before July 2017, an upfront contribution will be made to the plan following the disposal of the FT Group.
This is expected to be approximately 90m and there will be further annual contributions to eliminate any remaining shortfall in the self-su ciency funding.
At 31 December 2015, assets of the plan are divided into two elements: matching assets, which are assets that produce cash ows that can be expected to match the cash ows for a proportion of the membership, and include a Liability Driven investment mandate UK Bonds, interest rate in ation swaps and other derivative instruments, in ation-linked property and infrastructure: and return seeking assets, which are assets invested with a longer-term horizon to generate the returns needed to provide the remaining expected cash ows for the bene ciaries, and include equities, property and alternative asset classes.
During the fourth quarter of 2015 the plans long-term investment strategy was updated to an allocation of 84.2% Matching Assets and 15.8% Return Seeking Assets as at 31 December 2015.
Regular contributions to the plan in respect of the fide ned bene t sections are estimated to be 8m for 2016.
The Group expects to contribute $10m in 2016 and $10m in 2017 to its US fide ned bene t pension plans.
