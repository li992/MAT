Segment information The definition of the groups operating and reportable segments is provided on page 71.
EE was acquired on 29 January 2016 and up to 31 March 2016 has been reported as a separate line of business to the BT Group plc Operating Committee.
It is therefore a reportable segment.
EE had trading with other lines of business within the group which has become internal trade since acquisition, and is therefore eliminated on consolidation.

Internal revenue and costs Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business and therefore line of business profitability may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.
The majority of internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the customer-facing lines of business.
This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through BT TSO which is included within the Other segment.
BT Wholesale did not generate internal revenue from other lines of business before the EE acquisition, but now receives internal revenue from EE for mobile ethernet access and transmission planning services.
Internal revenue in BT Business relates primarily to IT services and BT Ireland.
Internal revenue arising in BT Consumer relates primarily to employee broadband and wi-fi services, while internal revenue in BT Global Services relates primarily to conferencing services.
