40 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Principal Accounting Policies Accounting policies describe the Companys approach to recognising and measuring transactions during the year and the position of the Company at the year end.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied during the year and the preceding year, unless otherwise stated.
a Basis of preparation Accounting Standards Applied The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies in November 2014.
Accordingly, FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland applies for these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 and has been applied for the first time.
The financial statements are issued on a going concern basis.
As a result of the first time adoption of FRS 102 and the revised SORP, comparative figures and presentation have been revised where required.
The net return attributable to ordinary shareholders and shareholders funds remain unchanged.
As an investment fund the Company has the option, which it has taken, not to present a cash flow statement.
A cash flow statement is not required when an investment fund meets all the following conditions: substantially all investments are highly liquid and are carried at market value, and where a statement of changes in equity in these financial statements it is called the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds is provided.
The accounting policies applied to these financial statements are consistent with those applied for the year ended 31 March, apart from a revision to cash which is now defined as cash and cash equivalents.
Note 1 d sets out the accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents.
No other accounting policies have changed as a result of the application of FRS102, amendments to FRS102 see below and the revised SORP.
Amendments to FRS 102 Fair value hierarchy disclosures March 16 amends paragraphs 34.22 and 34.42 of FRS 102, revising the disclosure requirements for financial instruments held at fair value to align these with the disclosure requirements of EU-adopted IFRS.
These amendments become effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The Company has chosen to early adopt these paragraphs.
There are no accounting policy or disclosure changes as a result of this adoption.
b Foreign Currency and Segmental Reporting i Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency and the currency in which the Companys share capital and expenses, as well as its assets and liabilities, are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currency, whether of a revenue or capital nature, are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital reserve or to the revenue account, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
iii Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business of investing in equity and debt securities, issued by companies quoted mainly on the UK or other recognised stock exchanges.
c Financial Instruments i Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.
THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 41 ii Derecognition of financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Any interest in the transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as an asset.
iii Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognises financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
iv Trade date accounting Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.
v Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The Companys investments are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, with transaction costs expensed in the income statement, and are subsequently valued at fair value.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices at the balance sheet date.
Fair value for investments that are actively traded but where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling.
Unquoted, unlisted or illiquid investments are valued by the Directors at fair value using a variety of valuation techniques including earnings multiples, recent transactions and other market indicators, cash flows and net assets.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash including short term deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as well as cash equivalents, including money market funds.
Investments are regarded as cash equivalents if they meet all of the following criteria: highly liquid investments held in the Companys base currency that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and provide a return no greater than the rate of a three-month high quality government bond.
e Hedging and Derivatives Forward currency contracts entered into for hedging purposes are valued at the appropriate forward exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are recognised in the income statement and taken to capital reserves.
Futures contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and are valued at the quoted price of the contract.
Profits and losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are recognised in the income statement and taken to capital reserves.
Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet.
Derivative instruments may be capital or revenue in nature and, accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognised in capital or revenue in the income statement as appropriate.
f Income Interest income arising from fixed income securities and cash is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Dividend income arises from equity investments held and is recognised on the date investments are marked ex-dividend.
Deposit interest and underwriting commission receivable are taken into account on an accruals basis.
42 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued g Expenses and Finance Costs Expenses are recognised on an accruals basis and finance costs are recognised using the effective interest method in the income statement.
The investment management fee and finance costs are allocated 70% to capital and 30% to revenue.
This is in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the portfolio.
Transaction costs are recognised as capital in the income statement.
All other expenses are allocated to revenue in the income statement.
h Taxation The liability to corporation tax is based on net revenue for the year, excluding non-taxable dividends.
The tax charge is allocated between the revenue and capital account on the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised in respect of surplus management expenses, losses on loan relationships and eligible unrelieved foreign tax to the extent that the Company is likely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.
i Dividends Payable Dividends are not recognised in the accounts unless there is an obligation to pay at the balance sheet date.
Proposed dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid to shareholders.

Taxation As an investment trust the Company pays no tax on capital gains.
As the Company invests principally in UK equities, it has little overseas tax and the overseas tax charge is the result of withholding tax deducted at source.
This note also clarifies the basis for the Company to have no deferred tax asset or liability.

d Factors that may affect future tax changes The Company has surplus management expenses and losses on loan relationships of 422,942,000 2015: 408,385,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 76,130,000 2015: 81,667,000, measured at the standard corporation tax rate of 18% 2015: 20%, has not been recognised in respect of these expenses since the Directors believe that there will be no taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax assets can be offset.
Return per Ordinary Share Return per share is the amount of gain generated for the financial year divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
The basic, capital and total returns per ordinary share are based on each return on ordinary shares after tax and on 195,275,887 2015: 195,116,734 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.

Dividends Dividends represent the distribution of income to shareholders.
The Company pays four dividends a year three interim and one final dividend.
Investments The portfolio comprises investments which are listed or traded on a recognised stock exchange, and a small proportion of investments which are valued by the Directors as they are unlisted or not regularly traded.

48 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 14.
Reserves This note explains the different reserves attributable to shareholders.
The aggregate of the reserves and share capital see previous note make up total shareholders funds.
The share premium comprises the net proceeds received by the Company following the issue of shares, after deduction of the nominal amount of 25 pence and any applicable issue costs.
The capital redemption reserve maintains the equity share capital arising from any buy back and cancellation of shares: both are non-distributable.
Capital investment gains and losses are shown in note 9 b, and form part of the capital reserve.
The revenue reserve shows the net revenue retained after payment of any dividends.
The capital and revenue reserves are distributable by way of dividend.
Net Asset Value NAV per Ordinary Share The Companys total net assets total assets less total liabilities are often termed shareholders funds and are converted into NAV per ordinary share by dividing by the number of shares in issue.
The NAV debt at par is the NAV with the value of the 100 million debenture the debt at its nominal equivalent to the par value of 100 million.
The NAV debt at market value reflects the debenture stock at the value that a third party would be prepared to pay for the debt, and this amount fluctuates owing to various factors including changes in interest rates and the remaining life of the debt.
The number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end was 195,666,734 2015: 195,116,734. a NAV debt at par The shareholders funds in the balance sheet are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards: however, this does not reflect the rights of shareholders on a return of assets under the Articles of Association.
These rights are reflected in the net assets with debt at par and the corresponding NAV per share.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures follows: 2016 2015 NAV SHAREHOLDERS NAV SHAREHOLDERS PER SHARE FUNDS PER SHARE FUNDS PENCE 000 PENCE 000 Shareholders funds 711.58 1,392,317 705.19 1,375,951 Less: Unamortised discount and expenses arising from debenture issue 0.84 1,632 0.96 1,883 NAV debt at par 710.74 1,390,685 704.23 1,374,068 b NAV debt at market value The market value of the debenture stocks is determined by reference to the daily closing price, and is subject to review against various data providers to ensure consistency between data providers and against the reference gilts.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments mainly comprise its investment portfolio as shown on pages 15 and 16 a debenture, a bank loan as well as its cash, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
For the purpose of this note cash should be taken to comprise cash and cash equivalents as defined in note 1 d. The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main financial risks that the Company faces from its financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities and management of gearing of the Company as more fully described in the Directors Report.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to fulfil its investment policy incorporating the Companys investment objective.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These policies are summarised below and have remained substantially unchanged for the two years under review.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk for the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board has meetings in each calendar quarter to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed in the Board Responsibilities on page 23.
Any borrowing to gear the investment portfolio is used to enhance returns but also increases the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
The Company has the ability to gear by using its 100 million debenture stock 2022 and its bank facility of 150 million.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and all of its liabilities are denominated in sterling.
There is some exposure to US dollar and Swiss franc.
Management of the currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys direct exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Forward currency contracts can be used to reduce the Companys exposure to foreign currencies arising naturally from the Managers choice of securities.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the assets denominated in currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
The Company may invest up to 20% of the portfolio in securities listed on non-UK stock exchanges.
At the year end holdings of non-UK securities total 227.4 million 2015: 212.0 million representing 14.5% 2015: 14.0% of the portfolio.
50 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 16.
Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued Risk Management Policies and Procedures continued Currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have currency exposure at 31 March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2016 2015 USD CHF USD CHF 000 000 000 000 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 1,119 1,115 1,905 1,253 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 152,475 74,917 120,832 91,179 Total net foreign currency exposure 153,594 76,032 122,737 92,432 The above may not be representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
Currency sensitivity In respect of the Companys direct foreign currency exposure to investments denominated in currencies, if sterling had weakened by 3.4% for the US dollar and 2.8% for the Swiss franc during the year, the income statement capital return and net assets of the Company would have increased by 7.3 million 2015: 8.4 million.
Conversely, if sterling had strengthened by the same percentage for the currencies mentioned above, the capital return and net assets of the Company would have decreased by the same amount.
The exchange rate variances of 3.4% for US dollar and 2.8% for Swiss francs 2015: US dollar 4.5% and Swiss franc 3.3% have been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable currency.
This sensitivity takes no account of any impact on the market values of the Companys investments arising from the foreign currency mix of their respective revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements will affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and money market funds, and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate determined by the custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon.
The Company has in place a revolving credit facility the facility, details of which are shown in note 11.
The Company uses the facility when required at levels monitored by the Board.
At the maximum possible facility gearing of 150 million, the effect of a 1% increase decrease in the interest rate would result in a decrease increase to the Company's income of 1,500,000.
The Company also has an uncommitted bank overdraft facility which it uses for settlement purposes and interest is dependent on the base rate determined by the Custodian.
The Companys debt of 100 million 2015: 100 million of debenture stock is fixed which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
Details of the debenture stock interest is shown in note 12, with details of its market value and the affect on net asset value in note 15 b.
The Company can invest in fixed income securities although at the year end none were held 2015: none.
Interest rate exposure At 31 March the exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when the interest rate is due to be reset: and fixed interest rates giving fair value interest rate risk when the financial instrument is due for repayment.
THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 51 2016 BETWEEN MORE ONE AND THAN WITHIN FIVE FIVE ONE YEAR YEARS YEARS TOTAL 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 1,981 1,981 Bank facility 80,000 80,000 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Debenture, excluding unamortised discount and issue expenses 100,000 100,000 Total exposure to interest rates 78,019 100,000 178,019 2015 BETWEEN MORE WITHIN ONE AND THAN ONE FIVE FIVE YEAR YEARS YEARS TOTAL 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 100 100 Bank overdraft 230 230 Bank facility 50,000 50,000 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Debentures, excluding unamortised discount and issue expenses 100,000 100,000 Total exposure to interest rates 50,130 100,000 150,130 Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the portfolio manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return that he can.
Management of the other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies, and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and need not be highly correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year and the net assets of the Company would decrease by 156 million 2015: 151 million.
Conversely, if the value of the portfolio rose by 10%, the profit after tax and the net assets of the Company would increase by the same amounts.
Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments constitute a diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the Company has an overdraft facility which it can use to provide short-term funding flexibility.

Counterparty risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
The Companys ability to operate in the short-term may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 5 million with any one deposit taker, with only approved deposit takers being used, and a maximum deposit of 75 million with Short-Term Investments Company Global Series plc, a triple-A rated money market fund.
Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, amounts due to brokers, accruals, cash and any drawings on the bank facility or at amortised cost debentures.
The book cost and fair value of the debenture, based on the offer value at the balance sheet date, are as follows: 2016 2015 BOOK FAIR BOOK FAIR VALUE VALUE VALUE VALUE 000 000 000 000 Debenture repayable in more than five years: 3 7 4% Debenture Stock 2022 100,000 130,208 100,000 135,439 Discount on issue of debenture 1,632 1,883 98,368 130,208 98,117 135,439 THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 53 Incorporating the fair value of the debentures, results in the reduction of the net asset value per ordinary share to 695.30p 2015: 686.07p.
Fair Value Hierarchy Disclosures All except three of the Companys portfolio of investments are in the Level 1 category as defined in FRS 102 as amended for fair value hierarchy disclosures March 16.
The three levels set out in FRS102 follow.
Level 1 The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note.
The sole investment in Level 2 comprised the Companys holding of Barclays Bank Nuclear Power Notes 28 February 2019.
The two investments in Level 3 are the result of past corporate events on securities already held: Eurovestech delisted from AIM and Proximagen CVRs arose as a partial cash alternative on the original Proximagen equity holding.
The holdings of these two securities did not change during the year.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued Capital Management The Companys total capital employed at 31 March 2016 was 1,570,685,000 2015: 1,524,298,000 comprising borrowings of 178,368,000 2015: 148,347,000 and equity share capital and other reserves of 1,392,317,000 2015: 1,375,951,000.
The Companys total capital employed is managed to achieve the Companys objective and investment policy as set out on page 7, including that borrowings may be used to provide gearing of the equity portfolio up to the maximum authorised by shareholders, currently 25% of net assets.
Net gearing was 12.8% 2015: 10.9% at the balance sheet date.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital were unchanged throughout the year and the preceding year.
The main risks to the Companys investments are shown in the Strategic Report under the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 9 to 12.
These also explain that the Company is able to use borrowings to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio.
The Board can manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy-back shares and it also determines dividend payments.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility by the terms imposed by the lender.
The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements.
This is unchanged from the prior year.
Borrowings comprise the debenture stock, details of which are contained in note 12, a bank facility and an overdraft facility which may be used for short-term funding requirements.
Contingencies, Guarantees and Financial Commitments This note would show any liabilities the Company is committed to honour, but which are dependent on future circumstances or events occurring.
There are no contingencies, guarantees or financial commitments of the Company at the year end 2015: nil.
