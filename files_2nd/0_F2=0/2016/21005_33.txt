On 12 February 2016, the Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange.
In preparation for the Initial Public Offering IPO the Ascential plc Group the Group was restructured between 8 and 12 February 2016.
The restructure has impacted a number of the primary financial statements and notes presented in these Company financial statements.
The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of the Company being inserted above Eden 2 & Cie S. C. A. which was previously the ultimate Parent undertaking of the Group.
The key steps in the restructure were: On 8 February 2016, the Company became the ultimate parent undertaking of the Group by acquiring the entire issued share capital of, and voting beneficiary certificates in, Eden 2 & Cie S. C. A. via a share for share exchange.
All the ordinary shares in Eden 2 & Cie S. C. A. were exchanged for 77,215,918 ordinary 0.10 shares and 1,824,766 F ordinary 0.10 shares issued by the Company.

On 9 February 2016, a shareholder transferred its shareholder loan receivable to the Company in exchange for 165.5 million of new PECs issued by the Company.
On 12 February 2016, the Companys F ordinary shares and new preference shares were converted into 89,665,977 ordinary 0.10 shares and the new PECs were capitalised through the issue of 133,118,105 ordinary 0.10 shares, thereby retiring all shareholder debt.
On 12 February 2016, the Company issued 100,000,000 ordinary 0.10 shares at an offer price of 2.00, generating proceeds of 200 million and bringing the total number of ordinary shares to 400,000,000.
50,000 ordinary 0.10 shares were issued outside of the underwriting agreements in place for the IPO but for the purpose of these financial statements these shares and their proceeds are presented as part of the IPO.
The acquisition of preference shares in Eden 2 & Cie S. C. A. was accounted for under the provisions of CA s615 whereby the shares issued by Ascential plc were recorded at nominal value of 17.5 million.
The preference shares in Eden 2 & Cie S. C. A. were a financial asset recorded at their fair value of 175.4 million.

On 8 June 2016, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, as contemplated in the IPO prospectus, whereby i the entire amount standing to the credit of the Companys share premium account was cancelled, ii 876,266,690 deferred shares which were issued by way of a bonus issue for the purpose of capitalising the Companys capital reserve were cancelled, and iii the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the Company was reduced from 0.10 to 0.01 each.

Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued became a guarantor to the new term loan facilities New Facilities Agreement held by Ascential Financing Ltd, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Group has prepared trading forecasts which indicate that there is sufficient liquidity headroom against all financial covenants for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements, and the Group will be able to meet the mandatory repayment terms of the banking facilities held in Ascential Financing Ltd, fully owned subsidiary of the Company.
After reviewing the above, taking into account current and future developments and principal risks and uncertainties, and making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and are satisfied that the Company financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.
Principal accounting policies A summary of the most important accounting policies is set out below.
a Investments in subsidiary Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Carrying values are reviewed for impairment either annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in carrying values.
b Amounts due from Group undertakings Amounts due from Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, less any impairment losses.
Amounts due from Group undertakings are reviewed for impairment either annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
c Creditors Creditors are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
d Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Timing differences are not provided for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future and the reporting entity is able to control the reversal of the timing difference.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising because certain types of income or expense are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
e Share-based payments Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment expense, no such increase in investment is recognised.
129 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued For the period ended 31 December 2016 1.
Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies continued f Shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust The Employee Benefit Trust EBT provides for the issue of shares to Group employees under share incentive schemes.
The Company has control of the EBT and accounts for the EBT as an extension to the Company in the financial statements.
Accordingly, shares in the Company held by the EBT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements The preparation of financial statements under FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions, and requires management to exercise its judgement and to make estimates in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
The areas requiring a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are discussed below.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates, particularly for share-based payments.
Investments The Company uses forecast cash flow information and estimates of future growth to assess whether investments are impaired.
If the results of operations in a future period are adverse to the estimates used for impairment testing, an impairment may be triggered at that point.
