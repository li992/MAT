The Group is comfortable that the risk attached to those counterparties is not significant and believes that the currency swaps, included in derivatives, continue to act as an effective hedge against the movements in the fair value of the Groups issued US$ denominated bonds see note 26 Financial instruments.

The reconciliation between tax expense and the product of accounting profit multiplied by the UK corporation tax rate for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 2016 2015 m m profit before tax 74.8 112.1 Notional charge at UK corporation tax rate of 20.00% 2015: 20.25% 15.0 22.7 Adjustments in respect of current income tax of prior years 17.4 10.3 Adjustments in respect of deferred tax of prior years 18.1 2.1 Non-deductible expenses 3.3 14.0 Non-deductible loss on business disposal 5.3 Non-deductible goodwill impairment 12.8 22.5 Impact of changes in statutory tax rates 1.6 0.5 Attributable to lower tax rates in overseas jurisdictions 3.2 3.8 Deferred tax unrecognised 2.3 3.5 At the effective tax rate of 43.4% 2015: 50.4% 32.5 56.5 Total tax expense reported in the income statement 32.5 56.5 The tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 32.5m 2015: charge of 56.5m.
The tax charge is equivalent to an effective tax rate of 43.4% 2015: 50.40%.
The effective tax rate on underlying profit is 18.5% 2015: 18.5%.
Adjustments in respect of current income tax of prior years of 17.4m includes a 5.8m net credit primarily relating to the successful resolution of issues with relevant tax authorities, 3.7m of adjustments which have a corresponding prior year deferred tax impact as noted above, 3m relating to the review of the tax treatment of various derivative related historic tax positions and 1.3m relating to successful prior year overseas tax incentive claims.
Adjustments in respect of deferred tax of prior years of 18.1m includes 14.4m due to the write off of deferred tax assets as a result of a review of the tax treatment of various derivative related historic tax positions, and 3.7m of adjustments which have a corresponding prior year current income tax impact.
Non-deductible expenses charged to underlying results are similar in 2016 and 2015.
Non-deductible expenses charged to non-underlying results and business exits in 2015, such as costs associated with the disposal of businesses, account for the change between periods.
131 Capita plc Strategic report Governance A Acco ccou un nt ts s NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 10 Income tax continued Deferred income tax Deferred income tax at 31 December relates to the following: Consolidated income Consolidated balance sheet statement 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Deferred tax liabilities Fair value adjustments on acquisition 65.3 79.5 23.5 30.9 65.3 79.5 Deferred tax assets Accelerated capital allowances 1.9 10.6 9.8 10.1 Share based payments 0.3 12.9 Pension schemes liability 46.5 20.0 4.3 Provisions 22.4 18.6 3.1 9.0 Losses available for offset against future taxable income 4.1 4.1 Mark-to-market movement on currency swaps 0.1 0.1 Cash ow forwards 1.7 1.7 1.3 Cash ow swaps 12.6 12.6 0.2 Cash ow hedges 2.8 75.2 79.3 Net deferred tax liability asset 9.9 0.2 Deferred income tax credit 6.5 37.4 The deferred tax asset of 0.3m in relation to share based payments as at 31 December 2016 has reduced from the balance held as at 31 December 2015 due to share awards vesting and the reduction of Capita plcs share price during the second half of the year.
Deferred tax assets totalling 17.2m as at 31 December 2015 in connection with mark-to-market and cash ow derivative movements have been written off during 2016 due to a review of the tax treatment of these instruments resulting in a total deferred tax balance of nil as at 31 December 2016.
The UK corporation tax rate will decrease from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The deferred tax balances have been adjusted to reect this change.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 177.0m 2015: 160.0m that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses or other temporary differences arose: of which 104.2m are related to losses incurred by companies acquired by the Group and therefore not as a result of the Groups trading performance.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of 177.0m 2015: 160.0m of these losses or other temporary differences, as their recoverability is uncertain.
Of the 177.0m, 169.8m relates to losses and 7.2m relates to other temporary differences.
150.6m of the 177.0m losses and temporary differences relate to the UK and have no time expiry.
These losses will be subject to proposed UK legislation which could result in restricted utilisation in the future.
26.4m of the 177.0m losses and temporary differences relate to various overseas jurisdictions, some of which are being subject to specic loss restriction rules and utilisation expiry periods of up to 8 years.
Dividends received from subsidiaries on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate.
The gross temporary differences of those subsidiaries affected by such potential taxes is 38.9m 2015: 27m.
No deferred income tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group les income tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world.
Various tax authorities are currently examining the Groups income tax returns.
Tax returns contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete.
Tax uncertainties are assessed throughout the year and specically at the year-end with any associated provisions recognised considering the specic circumstances of each risk, including the merits of technical aspects, previous experience with tax authorities, recent tax law and if relevant, external specialist advice.
While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, the Group does not currently anticipate that there will be any material impact on the Groups financial position or results of operations in the next financial year.
In addition, the Group continues to be directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulation worldwide.
Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
This includes potential changes arising out of the implementation of the recommendations of the Base Erosion and profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.
