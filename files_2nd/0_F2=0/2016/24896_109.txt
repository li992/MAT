CGUs are defined as geographical territories, because they represent the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
130 | HomeServe plc Financial statements Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to financial statements The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using estimated, country specific, long-term growth rates.
The pre-tax cost of capital rates used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows are different for each territory and are detailed: UK 7.5% FY15: 8.6% USA 10.6% FY15: 11.8% France 7.8% FY15: 8.6% Spain 8.0% FY15: 8.9% Pre-tax cost of capital rates used have reduced from FY15 due to a higher proportion of debt in the current year following the payment of the special dividend.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, which also reflects the different risk profile of each CGU.
The Group believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom in the value in use calculation versus the current carrying value.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2016 2015 m m UK 159.3 154.7 USA 4.7 4.5 France 71.2 65.9 Spain 12.5 11.5 247.7 236.6 The Groups CGU does not contain any intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives.
The long-term growth rate is 2% FY15: 2%.
