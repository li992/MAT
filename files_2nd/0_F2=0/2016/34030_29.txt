This standard sets out revenue recognition conditions for the Group and In the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group has adopted the following standards, amendments will be applicable from 1 July 2018.
The standard remains subject to industry interpretations and interpretations, none of which have had a material impact on the Group: and consensus.
The Group has continued, but not yet completed, its assessment of the impact Annual Improvements Cycle 2012 2014 of the standard, on the Group.
To date, we expect the standard may delay the recognition of revenue from construction contracts and may impact upon historical five-year warranty Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment obligations, although these will not affect the Groups cash flows.
In addition, the standard Amendments to IAS 38: Intangible Assets Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation will require presentational changes to our Income Statement to show part-exchange income and Amortisation and expenses separately, which are currently recognised on a net basis within cost of sales, as detailed in note 2.1.

1.5 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue The Group has continued, but not yet completed, its assessment of the impact of the standard but not yet effective on the Groups results and financial position.
To date, we expect that the majority of the Groups lease commitments will be brought onto the Balance Sheet together with corresponding right At the date of approval of these Financial Statements, there were a number of standards, of use assets.
This is likely to impact on the timing of the recognition of lease costs within the amendments and interpretations that have been published and are therefore mandatory for the Income Statement although it will not affect the Groups cash flows.
It is not practical to provide Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016 and later periods.
The Group has an estimate of the full effect of IFRS 16 until our assessment has been completed, which we not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.

The following new standards in particular are expected to have an impact upon the Group: Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows was issued in January 2016 and will be IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in final form incorporating the impairment, applicable to the Group from 1 July 2017.
The Amendment requires enhanced disclosures classification and measurement requirements in July 2014 and is scheduled to replace IAS 39 ofchanges in financing liabilities.
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 July 2018.
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the revisions on the Groups results and financial position, a process we expect to be finalised during the year ending 30 June 2017.
Until such assessment is completed it is not practical to provide an estimate of the full effect of IFRS 9.
116 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Section Recognition of profit where developments are accounted for under IAS 11 Construction Contracts The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising revenue and profit on partially completed contracts.
Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the 2 stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date.
When it is probable that the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in Results for the year and utilisation of profits the Income Statement immediately.
The application of this policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total expected costs to complete for each site.

Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the 12 months following the balance sheet date, at present it is not possible to accurately quantify the value of all of these reversals.
In the March 2016 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the intention to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, the impact of this is not included in these Financial Statements.
Had the change been enacted prior to the balance sheet date, there would be no significant impact on the deferred tax liability disclosed within these Financial Statements.
In addition to the deferred tax liability shown above, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 2.1m 2015: 2.3m in respect of capital and other losses because these are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.
122 Barratt Developments PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Carrying value of land and work in progress continued During the year, due to performance Section variations, changes in assumptions and changes to viability on individual sites, there were gross impairment charges of 11.0m 2015: 17.9m and gross impairment reversals of 2.4m 2015: 6.2m, resulting in a net impairment charge of 8.6m 2015: 11.7m included within profit from operations.
3 The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site, which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to complete.
The estimation of future sales prices and costs to complete included zero net inflation for the Working capital next three years and then low single digit net inflation thereafter.
During the year the Group benefited from favourable market conditions, but increased uncertainty due to Brexit.
If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around sales prices and estimated costs to complete, further 3.1 Inventories adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.

It also has to estimate costs tocomplete on such developments.
In making these assessments, there is a degree of inherent 4,326.6 4,173.6 uncertainty.
The Company has no inventories.
1 Nature of inventories The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will Carrying value of land and work in progress The Groups principal activities are be subject to a number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The majority of the development activity is not contracted prior to the development commencing.
Accordingly, the Group has in its Balance 3.1.
2 Expensed inventories Sheet at 30 June 2016 current assets that are not covered by a forward sale.
The Groups internal controls are designed to identify any developments where the balance sheet value The value of inventories expensed in the year ended 30 June 2016 and included in cost of sales was 3,233.7m 2015: 2,903.5m.
of land and work in progress is more than the projected lower of cost or net realisable value.
During the year the Group has conducted six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of specific sites identified as at high risk of impairment, based upon a number of criteria including low site profit margins and sites with no forecast completions.
Where the estimated net realisable value of a site was less than its current carrying value within the Balance Sheet, theGroup has impaired the land and work in progress value.
