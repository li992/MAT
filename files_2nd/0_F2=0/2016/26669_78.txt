34 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, which was amended on 22 November 2007, the primary objective of which was to ensure that the Group did not trigger a fide-grouping liability comprising Capital Gains Tax CGT and Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
Thiswould arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGTpurposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total potential fide-grouping liability now stands at 3.6 million 2015: 6.8 million, of which 3.1 million 2015: 6.3 million relates to CGT and 0.5 million 2015: 0.5 million relates to SDLT.

The letters of credit are secured on fixed deposits for the same amount.
