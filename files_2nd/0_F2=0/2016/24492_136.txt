SHARE OPTION SCHEMES CONTINUED 24.3 Valuation of options The fair value of services received in return for share options granted were measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The Group engaged a third party valuation specialist to provide a fair value for the options.
The 2014 options were valued using a Monte Carlo model due to the performance conditions associated with the options.
The 2014 cash-settled options were revalued using a Monte Carlo model at 31 December 2015.
During the year, the 2014 cash-settled options and some of the 2014 equity-settled options were cashed out at an exercise price of 422p.
The excess of the cash settlement over the fair value of the options at the date of the settlement has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a cost of share-based payments within exceptional items.

This is the bid price, not the mid-market price, at market close, as sourced from Bloomberg.
The measurement of the risk-free rate was based on rate of UK sovereign debt prevalent at each grant date over the expected term of the option.
For the 2016 LTIP scheme, the expected volatilities have been calculated using historical prices for companies that were constituents of the FTSE 250 at the grant date.
These options accrue dividend credits and the yield is assumed to be nil for 2016 and 10% thereafter.
As the schemes vest on a staggered basis over a period of up to 30 months, the volatilities have been calculated over each relevant time period.
The fair value of each phase of the options has been calculated separately, shown as a range in the table above, and the cost of each phase is allocated across the vesting period for that phase.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups principal financial instruments as at 31 December 2016 comprise cash and cash equivalents together with loan borrowings.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations and fund acquisitions and shareholder dividends.
The Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise receivables and payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group does not typically use derivative financial instruments, other than foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risks arising from operational, nancing and investment activities.
During 2016, the Group did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
25.1 Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cashows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in interest rates interest rate risk, foreign exchange rates currency risk or other market factors other price risk.
Exposure to market risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
25.2 Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups general operating policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Following the drawdown of the Cerberus loan in February 2016, the Group held a large position in GBP to meet working capital requirements.
This resulted in a foreign exchange loss following the devaluation of sterling during 2016.
This amount has subsequently been used in 2017 to hedge against significant GBP liabilities which have arisen including the dividend paid in February 2017 and repay the Cerberus loan.
The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk but as at 31 December 2016 there were no open foreign exchange contracts.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the euro, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-euro currencies.
1 Foreign exchange risk sensitivity A significant proportion of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in euros and GBP.
Holding the former currency minimises the Groups exposure to currency translation risk.
However, its significant holding of GBP net assets means that it is exposed to movements in the uctuation of this currency.
If the value of GBP relative to EUR was to rise by 10% then the value of the Groups net assets would increase by 15.9m whilst a 10% fall in the value of GBP relative to EUR would result in a fall in the Groups net assets of 15.9m.
This exposure was reduced after the year end as the Group utilised part of its GBP cash balances in renancing its long term loan and also to pay the dividend declared in December.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 25.3 Interest rate risk The Group earns interest from bank deposits.
During the year, the Group held cash on deposits with a range of maturities of less than three months.
The Group had a non-interest bearing loan see note 17 which did not carry any interest rate risk and which was repaid in 2016.
On 4 September 2015, the Group entered into an agreement with Cerberus Business Finance LLC for a loan of up to 400m, in order to part-fund the proposed acquisition of bwin.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had 386.5m 2015: 19.8m of committed and drawn-down borrowing facilities under this loan arrangement, including 13.5m repaid during the year.
The interest on these loans was based on EURIBOR with a oor of 1%, plus a margin of 11.5%.
This facility was repaid on 31 January 2017.
Management do not consider the impact of possible interest rate movements based on current market conditions to be material to the net result for the year or the equity position at the year end for either the year ended 31 December 2015 or 31 December 2016.
25.4 Credit risk The Group seldom has any significant concentrations of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The Group grants credit facilities to its customers and the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group has material exposure to credit risk through amounts owed by payment processors third party collection agencies of 60.0m 2015: 21.7m and cash and cash equivalent balances held with banking institutions of 367.0m 2015: 28.2m.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, most of which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or, at least, better quality PSPs.
The Group considers the general credit risk associated with these balances to be low, having assessed the credit ratings and financial strength of the counter-parties involved.
Nevertheless, the Group maintains a general provision against the recovery of these processing entities.
For one particular processor the Group considered that a specic provision may be necessary due to concerns about the recoverability of that specic debt and accordingly a specic impairment of 4.2m was recorded in the year ended 31 December 2016.
No further significant receivable amounts were past due date at 31 December 2016 2015: nil.
25.5 Liquidity and capital risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits, loans and trade and other receivables.
In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 367.0m 2015: 28.2m.
Whilst current assets are signicantly lower than current liabilities, this predominantly relates to the Cerberus loan which was renanced to a longer term facility in 2017.
Accordingly, the liquidity risk for the Group is judged to be low.
1 Maturity analysis All financial liabilities within the Groups balance sheet are due within one year except for certain contingent consideration of 4.4m which falls due based on certain events.
Managements best estimates are that these will fall due after more than one year but before five years.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 25.6 Fair values The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities, including deferred consideration in the Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2016 and 2015 for the Group and Company are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position are grouped into three levels of a fair value hierarchy.
The three levels are dened based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The following table shows the Levels within the hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total AT 31 DECEMBER 2016 m m m m FINANCIAL ASSETS Available for sale financial assets 2.2 0.4 2.6 Deferred consideration 1.8 1.8 Contingent consideration 0.6 4.0 4.6 Derivative financial assets 26.2 26.2 2.8 32.4 35.2 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Contingent consideration 4.4 4.4 4.4 4.4 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total AT 31 DECEMBER 2015 m m m m FINANCIAL ASSETS Available for sale financial assets 2.6 2.6 Derivative financial assets 3.8 3.8 6.4 6.4 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Derivative financial liabilities 9.9 0.7 10.6 9.9 0.7 10.6 There were no transfers between levels in 2016 or 2015.
Measure of fair value of financial instruments: The Groups finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values, in consultation with third party valuation specialists for complex valuations.
Valuation techniques are selected based on the characteristics of each instrument, with the overall objective of maximising the use of market-based information.
The valuation techniques for the derivative financial assets and liabilities are described in further detail in note 12 above.
The valuation technique for the available for sale asset and the contingent and deferred consideration assets and liabilities were discounted cashow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital and expected cashows.
