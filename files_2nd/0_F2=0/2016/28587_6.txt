Q4 REPORT 2016 Randgold ResouRces 9 ExPLORATION continued @ 0.60g t. The western anomalism is still open along strike and requires massawa further investigation along the margin of a tonalite.
Pit lines are being Work at Massawa continues to upgrade the geological model and is focused extended to cover this contact, while first results from infill soils along strike on improving the understanding of the geological controls and metallurgy are pending.
Results of the Block D metallurgical testwork were received.
The aim of this work is to confirm that the improved recoveries reported in nielle the last quarter from block C in comparison to historical testwork continue The drilling at Tongon NZ was completed early this quarter with 39 holes along strike of the CZ pit.
The results show a decrease in gravity recovery drilled to refine the granodiorite contacts, and test the model for areas of in the phase 2 mineralisation 29% compared to blocks A - C 34 - 44%.
Drill results suggest the area can be divided This was expected due to a reduction in the concentration of coarse free into different domains with some upside identified in the western part of milling gold associated with  veins in the the deposit where added thickness and additional mineralised structures north of the CZ.
In contrast, the CN leach recovery of the block D ore were identified.

The ore in mapped over a 190m strike in the centre of the deposit where structures the northern part of the CZ pit was thought to be predominately NZ style, and mineralised zones converge.
Assay results from this drilling have been however it is apparent that a large proportion of the gold is free milling variable and not always confirmed the observations of visible gold.

PrinciPal risK factors and uncertainties eXternal risKs nature and imPact Gold price volatility Gold price volatility can result in material and adverse movement in the groups operating results, asset values, revenues and cash flows.
Sustained or significant declines in the gold price will affect earnings and cash flow.
Group planning, forecasting and long term financial strategy are subject to gold price assumptions and therefore changes to the gold price may have an adverse effect the groups ability to fund its capital projects.
Country risk The group operates in jurisdictions where changes may occur to the political environment and governments may seek a greater share of mineral wealth.
Inadequate monitoring of in-country political instability and uncertainty or failure to adapt to changes to terms applicable to the groups operations may impact the ability to sustain operations, prevent the group from making future investments or result in increased costs for the group.
Corporate, social and environmental Some of the groups current and potential operations are located near communities responsibility that may regard these operations as being detrimental to them.
Poor management of stakeholder communication and expectations with a lack of community development activities or regard for environmental responsibility may lead to the inability to sustain operations in the area and impact the groups ability to expand into other regions.
Failure to understand social and environmental contexts can lead to insufficient planning, resourcing and costing of projects.
Failure to comply with environmental regulations could lead to fines and, in the extreme, loss of operating licence.
Supply routes Due to the remote location of the operations the disruption of supply routes may cause delays with construction and mine activities.
Supply chain failures, disruptions or significantly increased costs within the supply chain could have an adverse effect on the groups operations.
financial risKs nature and imPact Operating and capital cost control Operating cost and capital cost control are a key factor in the groups profitability.
Failure to control operating cost of production or operational objectives will result in reduced margins and profitability.
Failure or inability to monitor capital expenditure and progress of capital projects may result in financial losses, overspend on projects and cause returns to be eroded.
General cost inflation in the mining sector could affect the operations and projects resulting in significant pressure on operating and capital costs.
In-country tax regimes The group operates in jurisdictions which may change tax or fiscal regimes and regulations and, failure to adapt to such issues may result in fines and financial losses.
Inability to enforce legislation over tax or incorrectly applied legislation may result in lengthy arbitration and loss of profits.
Q4 REPORT 2016 Randgold ResouRces 15 oPerational risKs nature and imPact Production, reserves and resources The groups mining operations may yield less gold under actual production conditions than indicated by its gold reserve figures, which are estimates based on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, production costs and gold price.
In such instances the groups profitability may be affected should actual production be lower than indicated reserves.
Should the prevailing gold price not support or sustain the valuation the carrying value of assets may be impaired.
Environmental, health, safety and The mining sector is subject extensive health, safety and environmental laws, regulations security incident and standards alongside stakeholder expectations.
Failure to maintain environmental, health and safety standards may result in significant environmental or safety incidents or deterioration in safety performance standards leading to loss of life or significant loss of time and disruption or damage to operations.
Evolving regulation and standards could result in increased costs, litigation or in extreme cases may threaten the viability of an operation.
Risks associated with underground The group has a number of underground projects which are subject to the extensive mining and geotechnical failure risks associated with underground mining.
Failure to monitor or mitigate such risks may affect the profitability of the group and the operational performance.
Failure to consider geotechnical failure in planning and then monitor the impact during operations may impact the geotechnical stability of pits and underground mining operations.
Extreme weather conditions such as high rainfall may also impact the geotechnical stability of the pits and therefore could impact mining operations.
strategic risKs nature and imPact Lack of identification of new exploration The replacement of reserves and resources is key to the long term delivery of the groups targets and exploration failure exploration led growth strategy and therefore the lack of identification of new exploration targets may lead to a loss of revenue and an inability to grow and meet strategic objectives.
Exploration and development are costly activities with no guarantee of success, but are necessary for future growth of the group.
