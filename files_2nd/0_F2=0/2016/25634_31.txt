SEGMENT INFORMATION Management has determined its operating segments based on the analysis used to make strategic decisions.
BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments: Risk & Insurance, Employee Benefits and Head Office & Other operations.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Risk & Insurance segment comprises JLTs global specialist, wholesale, reinsurance broking, personal lines and SME activities.
The Employee Benefits segment consists of pension administration, outsourcing and employee benefits consultancy, healthcare and wealth management activities.
Certain Risk & Insurance and Employee Benefits operating segments have been disclosed within the reporting segments given their individual size.
The Head Office & Other segment consists mainly of holding companies, central administration functions, the Groups captive insurance companies and the Groups investments in associates.
JLT USA now qualifies as a reportable operating segment and as a result comparatives have been restated.
SEGMENT RESULTS Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based upon a measure of underlying trading profit.
Segment results include the net income or expense derived from the trading activities of the segment together with the investment income earned on fiduciary funds.
Interest income on the Groups own funds and finance costs are excluded since the trading activities of the Groups primary segments are not of a financial nature.
Income tax expense and the charge in respect of non-controlling interests are excluded from the segmental allocation.
SEGMENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments and are therefore all reported within Head Office & Other.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES The Group owns the following stakes in its principal associates: 20% of GrECo, which operates mainly in Austria and Eastern Europe: 25% of MAG JLT, which operates mainly in Italy and 25% of March-JLT, which operates mainly in Spain.
The investment and the Groups share of the net results of these associates are included in the Head Office & Other segment, together with the investment and results of the Groups other associates, Sterling Re Intermediaro fide Reaseguro SA fide CV, JLT Insurance Management Malta, JLT Energy France SAS and JLT Independent Insurance Brokers Private Ltd. During the year, the Group increased its stake in JLT Independent Insurance Brokers Private Ltd. from 26% to 49% for a consideration of 3,013,000.
On 6 May 2015, the Group disposed of its 26% stake in Milestone, the holding company of Siaci Saint Honor, generating cash proceeds of 80,235,000 and net exceptional gain of 18,595,000.
OTHER SEGMENT ITEMS Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.

INVESTMENT INCOME 2016 2015 000 000 Interest receivable - fiduciary funds 4,730 3,689 Prior year investment income 3,689 4,398 Effect of: - average cash balance variance 190 127 - interest yield variance 799 614 - foreign exchange variance 432 222 4,730 3,689 The Groups investment income arises from its holdings of cash and investments relating to fiduciary funds.
Equivalent average cash and investment balances during the year amounted to 797 million 2015: 766 million denominated principally in US dollars 57%, sterling 18% and Australian dollars 10%.
Based upon average invested balances each 1% movement in the average achieved rate of return would impact anticipated interest income by some 8.0 million.

Where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge or match these interest rate exposures.
The Groups policy is to continue to manage net interest rate exposures arising from the Groups cash including fiduciary funds and borrowings.
Each 1% movement in the average achieved interest rate impacts interest expense by approximately 5.6 million based on average net borrowings in 2016.

Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2016 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6.
EMPLOYEE INFORMATION CONTINUED SENIOR EXECUTIVE SHARE SCHEME The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees.
The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the Group.
Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
The awards have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Options granted prior to 1 January 2014 attract unconditional DDEs throughout the vesting period, this means that DDEs are paid to the option holders as and when dividends are paid to ordinary shareholders, there is no clawback on the dividends in the event of a forfeiture of the options.
The options granted post 1 January 2014 attract DDEs that are rolled up and paid in cash, on vesting.
The Group amended the plan rules on the 8 June 2015.
From that date, all vested options are no longer eligible to DDEs.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME Options were granted at a fixed price usually market price and are exercisable after the vesting period usually 3 years.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or market-purchased shares.
Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise.
This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29 September 2006.
SHARESAVE SCHEME The Sharesave Scheme is open to all employees and are exercised after 5 years from the date of grant.
The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the market price on the date preceding the date of invitation.
All Sharesave Scheme options have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee remains in employment with the Group.
All options must be exercised within 6 months of the vesting date.
As at 31 December 2016, there are no options outstanding in the scheme.
FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS Under IFRS 2 the fair value of awards granted during the year, calculated using a Black-Scholes model, is set out below: Black-Scholes model assumptions Exercise Share price Dividend Risk free Fair value of price Performance on grant date Volatility yield Maturity Interest rate one award pence period pence % % years % pence JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2013 Senior Executive Share Scheme 2016 31 March - 2016 - 22 844.50 20.67 - 1 - 6 0.86 844.50 2016 23 September - 2016 - 21 1,013.00 21.87 - 1 - 5 0.21 1,013.00 The option holders who have awards under the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Assuming that the dividend yield is zero and that the options are issued with no cost to the employees, then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using a 3 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Groups employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
For Executive Share Option and Sharesave Schemes this is 20%.
For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee.

There were no non-recurring tax credits in the year.
In July 2015 the UK Government announced further measures in relation to the UK corporation tax rate, reducing the headline rate of corporation tax to 19% from April 2017 and then to 18% from April 2020.
A further 1% reduction in the main rate of corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in Budget 2016.
As at 31 December 2016, the additional 1% rate reduction to 17% from April 2020 has been enacted.
The impact of the rate reduction to 17% has been incorporated into the income tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2016, taking into consideration when timing differences are expected to reverse.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Following changes to the terms of several share-based staff compensation schemes, whereby dividend rights eligibility were removed in certain circumstances, a comprehensive review of IAS 33 earnings per share or EPS was undertaken in the year to determine the impact of these changes.
The schemes affected by this change include the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 2013, the Senior Executive Share Scheme, the Executive Share Option Scheme, and the Sharesave Scheme.
The review considered whether the share options in these plans continued to qualify as participating equity instruments under IAS 33 for the purposes of calculating basic and diluted EPS.
With the changes to schemes, the review concluded that only vested share options eligible to receive discretionary dividend equivalents should be included in the basic calculation.
As a result, for the basic EPS calculation, the number of ordinary shares in 2015 should reduce from 219,234,336 to 210,767,437, resulting in an increase in basic EPS of 1.6p from 47.0p to 48.6p.
The review also concluded that unvested share options should be included in the diluted EPS calculation, using the treasury stock method.
This has the effect of reducing the number of ordinary shares in the 2015 diluted EPS calculation from 219,451,514 to 214,939,730, resulting in an increase in diluted EPS of 1.0p from 47.0p to 48.0p.
Under the revised calculation, basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year and the vested share options eligible for discretionary dividend equivalents, excluding unallocated shares held by the Trustees of the Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust, which are treated as treasury shares.
The profit attributable to shareholders is the profit attributable to the owners of the parent adjusted for the dividend equivalents and undistributed earnings attributable to the unvested share options carrying unconditional dividend equivalent rights.
Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to take account of the potential dilutive effect of outstanding share options.
Basic and diluted EPS are also calculated based on underlying earnings attributable to shareholders, which exclude any exceptional items.

GOODWILL CONTINUED IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period and are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital.
2 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations were: The budgeted trading profit growth: Management determines budgeted trading profit based on past experience and its expectation for market development.
The budgeted IBA interest income growth is based on past experience and long-term interest rates projections.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segment and country of operation.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with long-term economic forecasts in the countries of operation.
The value-in-use is compared to an adjusted goodwill.
The adjusted goodwill is the goodwill grossed up to reflect a 100% ownership by the Group.
The key sensitivity analysis are: A decrease of 1% on the growth rate resulted in a reduction of 19% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.
An increase of 2% on the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 36% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.
A combined decrease of 1% on the growth rate and an increase of 2% in the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 44% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.

Instruments included in level 1 are financial instruments traded in active markets for which the fair value is based upon quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms-length basis.
Instruments included in level 2 are financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives and for which the fair value is determined by using internal and external models.
These models maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 2 includes derivatives used for hedging.
The valuations of which are performed using a discounted cash flow methodology incorporating observable market forward foreign exchange and interest rates.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: UK US Canadian Irish US Stable At 31 December 2016 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Value Plan Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 3.25% n a n a Rate of increase of pensions in payment a 3.24% n a 3.25% 3.00% n a Discount rate b 2.80% 4.00% 3.90% 1.90% 3.35-3.40% Inflation rate 3.34% 2.00% 2.25% 1.50% 2.00% Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners 2.34% n a n a 1.50% n a Mortality - life expectancy at age 65 for male members: c Aged 65 at 31 December years 21.8 21.3 22.0 22.8 21.3 UK US Canadian Irish US Stable At 31 December 2015 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Value Plan Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 2.50% n a n a Rate of increase of pensions in payment a 2.82% n a 3.25% 3.00% n a Discount rate b 3.86% 4.20% 4.00% 2.50% 3.50-3.55% Inflation rate 2.92% 2.00% 2.25% 1.75% 2.00% Revaluation rate for deferred pensioners 1.92% n a n a 1.75% n a Mortality - life expectancy at age 65 for male members: c Aged 65 at 31 December years 21.7 21.7 22.0 22.8 21.7 a In respect of the UK scheme, where there are inflation linked benefits, the inflation increases are limited to a maximum of 5% per annum some are limited to 3% per annum.
b In line with IAS 19 Revised the expected return on scheme assets assumption is the same as the discount rate assumed for the liabilities.
c Mortality assumptions for the UK scheme are based on 105% of the S2PxA tables, with improvements based on CMI 2015 tables with a 1.25% p. a. long-term rate of improvement.
Mortality assumptions for the US Scheme and US Stable Value Plan are based on the RP2014 Mortality Table with MP2016 Projections.
Mortality assumptions for the Canadian Scheme are based on the CPM-2014 Private Table with generational projection using scale CPMB1D2014.
Mortality assumptions for the Irish Scheme, assume that deaths after retirement will be in accordance with standard mortality tables 90% PxA92C 2004 with allowance for expected future mortality improvements.
There is assumed to be no pre-retirement mortality.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Change to assumptions obligation Discount rate decrease of 0.1% increase of 2.0% Inflation rate increase of 0.1% increase of 1.0% Life expectancy increase of 1 year increase of 4.0% The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
Note this sensitivity is for defined benefit obligations only and does not consider the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the assets, in particular the assets held in respect of the insured pensioners.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous year.

IFRS requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Significant management judgement is required to comply with this guidance.
The Group analyses its litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
On the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group.
However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any annual period could be materially affected by an unfavourable resolution of these matters.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees and letters of credit given on behalf of Group companies amounting to 12,024,000 2015: 7,113,000.

Pending the outcome of the UK Financial Conduct Authoritys review a provision has been created for the estimated administration costs of completing the work for this review.
It is too early to determine whether any further liability exists.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On 27 January 2017, the Group announced the acquisition of a 50.1% ownership interest in CRP Holding Company LLC, the holding company of Construction Risk Partners LLC, one of the leading construction risk and surety specialty brokers in the USA, for a consideration of USD 50,000,000 subject to adjustment.
