90 BT plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2016 13. Business combinations continued Goodwill Goodwill of 6,430m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the revenue synergies expected to be generated from new cross-selling and bundling opportunities across the enlarged customer base as well as EEs ability to generate a new subscriber base in the future to replace subscriber churn.
It also includes expected benefits from the existing workforce skills and expertise, and savings on operating costs and capital expenditure as a result of joint efficiencies expected from being part of the enlarged group.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
For the year ended 31 March 2016, goodwill arising on the acquisition has been allocated to the EE, BT Consumer and BT Business CGUs.
BT Consumer and BT Business have been allocated a portion of the goodwill as a result of the benefits that we expect to arise in these CGUs, mainly from synergies.
Note 12 Intangible assets sets out the goodwill allocation for the year ended 31 March 2016 including the outcome of the impairment reviews.
From 1 April 2016, certain businesses within EE will be integrated into the other lines of business as part of the reorganisation disclosed in note 30.
The goodwill relating to EE will therefore be reallocated to other CGUs for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Acquired receivables The fair value of acquired trade receivables was 696m.
The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is 784m of which 88m is expected to be uncollectible.
Revenue and profit contribution From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2016, EE contributed revenues before specific items of 1,038m and EBITDA before specific items of 261m to the group.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2015, the consolidated pro-forma revenue and EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2016 would have been 23,722m and 7,948m respectively.
