3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 48 Strategic report Reconciliation of Investment basis to IFRS As a result we introduced separate non-GAAP Investment basis Background to Investment basis Statements of comprehensive income, financial position and cash nancialstatements ow in our 2014 Annual report and accounts to aid understanding The Group makes investments in portfolio companies directly, of our results.
The Strategic report is also prepared using the held by 3i Group plc, and indirectly, held through intermediate Investment basis as we believe it provides a more understandable holding company and partnership structures Investment entity view of our performance.
Total return and net assets are equal subsidiaries.
It also has other operational subsidiaries which under the Investment basis and IFRS: the Investment basis is provide services and other activities such as employment, simply a look through of IFRS 10 to present the underlying regulatory activities, management and advice Trading performance.
The two diagrams below illustrate these changes, subsidiaries.
Theapplication of IFRS 10 requires us to fair value together with an illustrative example to show how information can anumber of intermediate holding companies that were previously be aggregated.
This fair value approach, applied at the intermediate holding company level, effectively obscures the Reconciliation between Investment basis and IFRS performance of our proprietary capital investments and A detailed reconciliation from the Investment basis to IFRSbasis associated transactions occurring in the intermediate holding of the Statement of comprehensive income, Statement of financial companies.
The financial effect of the underlying portfolio position and Cash ow statement is shown on pages 49 to 52. companies and fee income, operating expenses and carried interest transactions occurring in Investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into a single value.
Other items which were previously eliminated on consolidation are now includedseparately.

In the Investment basis accounts we have disaggregated these line items to analyse our total return as if these Investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent with prior years.
The adjustments simply reclassify the Statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal under the Investment basis and the IFRS basis.
2 Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held directly by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries.
Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through Investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single Fair value movement on investment entity subsidiaries line.
This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts.
3 Foreign exchange movements have been reclassied under the Investment basis as foreign currency asset and liability movements.
Movements within the Investment entity subsidiaries are included within Fair value movements on investment entities.
4 Other items also aggregated into the Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries line include fees receivable from external funds, audit fees, custodian fees, bank charges, other general and administration expenses, carried interest and tax.
The IFRS basis is audited and the Investment basis is unaudited.
The external Auditor states in its Audit report on pages 140 to 145 that the information given inthe FY2016 Strategic report and the Corporate Governance report is consistent with the financial statements.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 51 Overview Strategic report Corporate Governance Audited financial statements Portfolio and other information Notes: 1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of financial position aggregates the line items into the single line item Investment in investment entities.
In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the Investment entity subsidiaries were consolidated.
The adjustment reclassies items in the Statement of financial position.
There is no change to the net assets, although for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different.
The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is signicantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by Investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into the Investments in investment entities line.
We have disaggregated this fair value and disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments or unquoted equity investments.
Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates these items.
2 Cash balances held in Investment entity subsidiaries are also aggregated into the Investment in investment entities line.
At 31 March 2016 5 million 2015: 3 million of cash was held in subsidiaries that are now classied as Investment entity subsidiaries and is therefore included in the Investment in investment entities line.
3 Intercompany balances between Investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results under the IFRS basis.
If anInvestment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the Group, then the asset or liability of the Investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Statement of financial position for the Group.
Prior to the adoption of IFRS 10, these balances would have been eliminated on consolidation.
4 Investment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately under this basis.

Therefore in our Investment basis financial statements, we have disclosed our cash ow statement on a look through basis, in order to reect the underlying sources and uses of cash ows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis financial statements and the IFRS financial statements because there are cash balances held in Investment entity subsidiary vehicles.
Cash held within Investment entity subsidiaries will not be shown in the IFRSstatements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.
