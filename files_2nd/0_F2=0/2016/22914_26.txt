The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Theparent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 1.16.
1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and share based payment charges which are measured at their fair value.
The financial statements are for the 52 weeks to 30 July 2016 last year 52 weeks to 1 August 2015.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 91 to 94.
Going concern The Group remains highly cash generative and currently has sufficient medium and long term facilities in place, including 200.0million of a senior loan facility maturing in 2020 and a 30.0 million revolving credit facility in place until March 2020 which is as yet unutilised.
Further details of these facilities and the Groups financial management objectives are detailed in the financial statements.
On the basis of their assessment of the Groups financial position, forecasts and projections, the Companys directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
1.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
1.3 Gross sales and revenue Gross sales represent the total amounts payable by external customers, without adjustment for the time value of money, for goods and services supplied by the Group, including aftercare services for which the Group acts as an agent, delivery charges and value added and other sales taxes.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable by the Group for the provision of goods and services to external customers, being gross sales less: value added and other sales taxes, the costs of obtaining interest free credit on behalf of customers and the amounts payable to third parties relating to services for which the Group acts as an agent.
For services where the Group acts as an agent, the amount recognised in revenue is the net fee receivable by the Group.
Both gross sales and revenue are stated net of returns and sales allowances, and are recognised when goods have been delivered to the customer, the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and collectability is reasonably assured.

The principal items which may be included as non-underlying are: significant profit or loss on the disposal of non-current assets: impairment charges: significant non-recurring tax charges or credits: and costs associated with significant corporate, financial or operating restructuring, including acquisitions or the establishment of operations in new geographical territories.
Material finance income or expenses associated with significant changes in the Groups borrowings are disclosed separately as exceptional items below operating profit.
Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance income and expenses Finance expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method and unwinding of the discount on provisions.
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the Groups right to receive payments is established.
1.5 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Payments to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share based payments is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the related awards, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Fair values are calculated using option pricing models appropriate to the terms and conditions of the awards.
The amount charged as an expense is regularly reviewed and adjusted to reflect the achievement of service and nonmarket based performance conditions.
1.6 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
At interim reporting periods the tax charge is calculated in accordance with IAS 34, adjusted for material non-taxable items.
A deferred tax asset is recognised on deductible temporary differences only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement except for differences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
1.8 Business combinations Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the acquisition cost over the Groups interest in the assets and liabilities recognised.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Acquisitions prior to 31 July 2011 date of transition to IFRSs IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period.
The Group and Company elected not to restate business combinations that took place prior to 31 July 2011.
In respect of acquisitions prior to transition, goodwill is included at 31 July 2011 on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that goodwill was amortised.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill ceased as required by IFRS 1.
1.9 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Lease payments are accounted for as described in 1.4 above.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: buildings 50 years plant and equipment 4 to 10 years motor vehicles 4 years computer equipment 3 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
1.10 Intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairmentlosses.
indb 73 12 10 2016 18:06 Job: Proof Read by: Operator: update when worked on Proof: 00 Set-up: put your name here Date: First Read Revisions DFS Annual report and accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED at 30 July 2016 1 Accounting policies continued Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Estimated useful lives are asfollows: computer software and website costs 3 years acquired brand names 20 years 1.11 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of finished goods manufactured by the Group includes direct materials, direct labour and appropriate overhead expenditure.
1.12 Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.13 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Details of provisions recognised are in note 19 and the related significant estimates and judgments in note 1.16.
1.14 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss remains in the hedging reserve and is reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.
For other cash flow hedges the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Group revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.16 Significant areas of estimation and judgment In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the value of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors, but may differ from actual results.
Significant areas of estimation for the Group includethe costs of meeting customer guarantees and property related provisions note 19, the selling prices applied in determining net realisable values of inventories note 13 and the assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for the impairment of goodwill note 9.
1.17 New accounting standards A number of new or revised standards and interpretations have been issued which are not yet effective or endorsed by the EU, including IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 16 Leases, and which have not therefore been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Of these, only IFRS 16 is expected to have a material impact on the future financial statements of the Group since it would require the substantial majority of the Groups operating lease commitments c67.0m on an undiscounted basis as shown in note 25 of the financial statements to be brought on to the balance sheet, resulting in the recognition of significant lease assets and liabilities which would be depreciated and amortised separately.
IFRS 16 would first apply to the Group for the financial year ending July 2020.
2 Segmental analysis The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on management accounts reports reviewed by the Board.
Segment performance is assessed based upon earnings before interest and tax excluding depreciation charges and nonunderlying items underlying EBITDA.
The Group has only one reportable segment, which derives its revenues from the retailing of upholstered furniture and related products.
Activities included in other segments comprise the manufacture and distribution of upholstered furniture.

This acquisition was made to facilitate the expansion of the Groups operations in Europe and to secure the rights to the use of the DFS brand name in Spain.
The goodwill of 1.0m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the workforce and operations of the acquired business.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed comprised the intangible asset of the DFS Spain brand name which had a fair value of 0.5m at acquisition.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the following cash generating units: Goodwill 2016 2015 m m DFS Trading Limited 479.6 479.6 The Sofa Workshop Limited 4.4 4.4 DFS Spain 1.0 485.0 484.0 Goodwill is tested annually for impairment on the basis of value in use.
The key assumptions underlying the calculations are those regarding expected future sales volumes, changes in selling prices and direct costs and the discount rate applied.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared from the latest financial results and internal budgets for the next four years, which take into account external macroeconomic indicators as well as internal growth expectations.
Selling prices and related costs are based on past practice and expected future changes in the market.
These forecasts were extrapolated for six more years with no further growth assumed and discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.2% 2015: 9.0%.
The discount rates are estimated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, risk adjusted for an individual units circumstances.
The Group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonably possible changes in assumptions could cause an impairment that would be material to these consolidated financial statements.
Even with an assumption of no further growth beyond the four year budgeted period, a discount rate in excess of 18% would need to be applied in order for there to be any indication of an impairment.
The directors have therefore concluded that no reasonably possible change in assumptions would result in an impairment of the assets and accordingly none has been recognised.

On 17 February 2015 a further 192,708,003 1ordinary shares were issued to capitalise principal and accrued interest on outstanding loans from parent companies.
No gain or loss arose from this transaction as the carrying value of the shareholder debt reflected its fair value.
One further 1 ordinary share was issued on 22 February 2015 and the resulting total of 235,323,222 ordinary shares of 1 each were then consolidated to 156,882,148 ordinary shares of 1.50 each.
On 10 March 2015 a total of 17,717,081 ordinary shares of 1.50 each were issued to senior management and certain other employees of the Group in exchange for their minority interests in the issued share capital of DFS Investments Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company which has subsequently been placed into Members Voluntary Liquidation.
On 11 March 2015 a further 38,431,372 ordinary shares of 1.50 each were issued for cash consideration of 98.0m, conditional to the Admission of the Companys shares to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
This brought the total shares in issue at 2 August 2015 to 213,030,601 ordinary shares of 1.50 each.
Share premium The share premium account represents the surplus of consideration received for issued ordinary share capital over its nominal value.
The balance of 59.0m arose during the year on the issue ordinary shares on 11 March 2015 as noted above.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the issue of shares in the Company in exchange for minority interests in the issued share capital of a subsidiary company on 10 March 2015 as noted above.
Treasury shares Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital into treasury treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
During the period ending 30 July 2016 the Company purchased 1,500,000 of its own ordinary shares at a total cost of 3.7m for the purpose of satisfying employee share based payment awards.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.

The directors consider that the fair values of each category of the Groups financial instruments are the same as their carrying values in the Groups balance sheet.
23 Financial instruments: risk management The objectives, policies and processes governing the treasury activities of the Group are reviewed and approved by the Board.
The Groups documented treasury policy includes details of authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits and principles for the management of liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risks.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements to ensure that it has sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due while making efficient use of the Groups financial resources.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows including interest of the Groups financial liabilities: 2016 Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Total m m m m m Trade and other payables 152.4 152.4 Finance lease liabilities 2.0 1.7 2.2 5.9 Senior loan facility 5.6 5.6 209.9 221.1 Other liabilities 5.4 2.8 0.6 2.1 10.9 165.4 10.1 212.7 2.1 390.3 Derivatives: net settled 1.4 1.3 2.2 4.9 Derivatives: gross settled Cash inflows 37.4 37.4 Cash out flows 34.0 34.0 Total cash flows 163.4 11.4 214.9 2.1 391.8 86 25579 DFS RA BOOK.

Interest rate risk management The Groups operating profit is affected by the cost of providing interest free credit to its customers.
A fall in LIBOR rates would have a positive impact on operating profit and a rise in LIBOR rates would impact operating profit negatively.
An increase by one percentage point would reduce the Groups revenue by 0.4 percentage points.
However, any fall in LIBOR rates at present would largely be offset by LIBOR floor mechanisms used by the external providers of credit to the Groups customers.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its senior loan facility, which bears interest at a floating rate of 3 month GBP LIBOR plus 2.50%.
In order to provide some certainty over the future cash flows associated with this debt, the Group has entered into four participating interest rate swaps.
The effect of these instruments is to fix the interest rate payable on the senior loan facility to a maximum level while allowing the Group to retain some benefit on a proportion of the facility where 3 month LIBOR remains below 1.39%.
The swaps cover the full 200.0m of the senior loan facility for its duration until March 2020.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate derivatives are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Interest rate swaps Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 6.1 1.3 Foreign exchange risk management The Group is exposed to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations on the purchase of products denominated in foreign currencies.
Currency requirements are assessed by analysis of historic purchasing patterns by month, adjusted as appropriate to take into account current trading expectations.
The Groups treasury policy allows for the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these anticipated future purchases between 9 and 18 months in advance.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
The table below summarises the forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the period end: 2016 2015 Notional amount Fair value Notional amount Fair value m m m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships US Dollar 34.0 3.0 72.0 0.3 The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m US Dollar 0.1 1.7 0.8 Euro 2.7 8.0 0.3 0.3 87 Job: Proof Read by: Operator: update when worked on Proof: 00 Set-up: put your name here Date: First Read Revisions DFS Annual report and accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED at 30 July 2016 23 Financial instruments: risk management continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups primary foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% weakening of these currencies against Sterling, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historicvolatility.
The analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the cash flow hedging reserve in equity.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
Income statement Equity 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m US Dollar 0.2 0.1 3.9 7.2 Euro 0.2 0.8 A 10% strengthening of the above currencies against the Sterling at the period end would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Financial risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups investment securities.
Investments of cash, borrowings and derivative instruments are transacted only through counterparties meeting the credit rating and investment criteria specified in the Groups treasury policy.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are regularly reviewed.
Concentrations of risk are mitigated through the use of multiple counterparties and by counterparty limits which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having .
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in note 26, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
24 Share based payments The Group has three share based payment schemes in operation: Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary executive reward plan that allows the Group to grant conditional share awards or nil-cost options to selected executives at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The scheme is focused on the senior leadership roles in the Group, including Executive Directors.
The maximum value of LTIP awards granted to an individual is 150% of base salary, although the Remuneration Committee may in exceptional circumstances increase this to 300%.
LTIP awards vest after a three year performance period other than those granted shortly after Admission which will vest in July 2017 subject to the achievement of performance measures based on earnings per share and total shareholder return targets.
Further information on LTIP performance targets and awards made to Directors is given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 62.
Restricted Share Plan RSP The RSP is also a discretionary reward plan under which conditional share awards or nil-cost options may be granted to individuals in key executive roles in the Group, excluding Executive Directors and other recipients of LTIP awards.
Awards may not exceed 50% of an individuals salary for a particular financial year.
RSP awards vest after a three year performance period other than those granted shortly after Admission which will vest in July 2017 and are not subject to other performance conditions.

The current maximum monthly savings limit for the schemes is 250.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and vest three years from the date of grant.
The movements in outstanding awards under each of the schemes are summarised below: no awards vested or were exercised during the year and at 30 July 2016 no outstanding awards were exercisable.
Outstanding at the beginning of the year 625,603 131,414 Granted 569,322 633,210 1,670,678 Forfeited 223,868 57,855 29,620 Outstanding at the end of the year 971,057 706,769 1,641,058 Weighted average remaining contractual life months 17.9 21.7 30.2 Fair value calculations The LTIP, RSP and SAYE awards are all accounted for as equity-settled under IFRS 2.
The fair value of LTIP awards which are subject to a market based performance condition total shareholder return is calculated using a stochastic Monte Carlo option pricing model.
RSP awards, SAYE awards and LTIP awards subject to a non-market based performance condition earnings per share are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to these models for awards granted during the financial period are detailedbelow: LTIP RSP SAYE Grant date 23 October 2015 18 November 2016 10 December 2015 Share price at date of grant 3.14 3.31 3.35 Exercise price Nil Nil 2.62 2 Volatility 23.8% 24.0% Expected life 3 years 2.7 years 3 years 2 Risk free rate 0.75% 0.75% 1 Dividend yield 2.8% 3.0% Fair value per share Market based performance condition 1.82 Non-market based performance condition no performance condition 3.14 3.07 0.75 1.
LTIP participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents on unvested awards therefore dividend yield does not impact the fair value calculation 2.
Volatility and risk free rates do not impact the fair value calculation for awards with no exercise price or market based performance condition As the Company had only limited share price history at the date of grant, expected volatility was based on a proxy volatility determined from the median volatility of a group of appropriate comparator companies within the FTSE All Share index.
For the same reason, a similar approach was followed to derive the dividend yield.
Expected life has been assumed to equate to the vesting period of theawards.
The total share based payment expense included in administration costs in respect of the above schemes was 1.2m 2015: 0.6m.
In the previous year there was an additional 0.4m of accelerated charges in connection with the Companys IPO which were presented as non-underlying costs.
