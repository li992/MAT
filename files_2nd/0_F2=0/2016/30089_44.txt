Transfers between hierarchy levels There were no transfers during the year between level 1 and level 2 nor between levels 1 or 2 and level 3.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 f. Sensitivity information The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of investment properties are: Estimated rental value: 4-50 per sq ft 2015: same Capitalisation rates: 4%-9% 2015: same Significant increases decreases in estimated rental value in isolation would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement.
A significant increase decrease in Capitalisation Rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement.
11 Financial Instruments Risk management policies and procedures The Group invests in equities and other instruments for the long term in the pursuit of the Investment Objective set out on page 24.
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction or an increase in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: Market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk Liquidity risk Credit risk The Managers policies and processes for managing these risks are summarised on pages 28 to 30 and have been applied throughout the year.
11.1 Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Manager runs a diversified portfolio and reports to the Board on the portfolio activity and performance at each board meeting.
The Board monitors the investment activity and strategy to ensure it is compatible with the stated objectives.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its quoted equity investments, CFDs and investment property portfolio, was as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Investments held at fair value 1,098,560 1,055,988 CFD long gross exposure 99,476 82,793 Concentration of exposure to price risks As set out in the Investment Policies on page 25, there are guidelines to the amount of exposure to a single company, geographical region or direct property.
These guidelines ensure an appropriate spread of exposure to individual or sector price risks.
As an investment company dedicated to investment in the property sector, the Group is exposed to price movements across the property asset class as a whole.

Management of the risk The Board receives a report at each board meeting on the proportion of the investment portfolio held in Sterling, Euros or other currencies.
The Group may sometimes hedge foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency or through forward currency contracts.
Cash deposits are held in Sterling and or Euro denominated accounts.

Property companies usually have borrowings themselves and the level of gearing and structure of its debt portfolio is a key factor when assessing the investment in a property company.
The Group has fixed and variable rate borrowings.
The interest rates on the loan notes is fixed, details are set out in note 13.
At 31 March 2016, in addition to the loan notes the Group had unsecured, multi-currency revolving loan facilities which carry variable rates of interest based on the currencies drawn, plus a margin.
The Manager considers both the level of debt on the balance sheet of the Group i. e. the loan notes and any bank loans drawn and the see-through gearing, taking into account the assets and liabilities of the underlying investments, when considering the investment portfolio.
These gearing levels are reported regularly to the Board.
The majority of the Groups investment portfolio is non-interest bearing.
As a result the Groups financial assets are not directly subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 March of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due to be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets:42,146,000 2015: 21,427,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets: 951,000 2015: 6,998,000.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities: 54,643,000 2015: 15,000,000.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on liabilities: 15,000,000 2015: 53,000,000.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a marg in over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2015: same Interest paid on borrowings under the multi-currency loan facilities, is at a marg in over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent for the type of loan T he finance charges on the e50m and 15m loan notes are at interest rates of 1.92% and 3.59% respectively.
T he finance charge on the debenture stock repaid in February 2016 was at an interest rate of 11.85% 2015: 11.86%.
The year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rates changes.
Interest rate sensitivity A change of 2% on interest rates at the reporting date would have had the following direct impact: 2016 2016 2015 2015 2% 2% 2% 2% Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 000 000 000 000 Change to shareholders funds 440 440 499 499 Change to total earnings per Ordinary share 0.14 p 0.14p 0.16 p 0.16p This level of change is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes throughout the period.
This assessment does not take into account the impact of interest rate changes on the market value of the investments the Group holds.

The Group held one unquoted investment at the year end see 11.6 below.
In certain market conditions, the liquidity of direct property investments may be reduced.
At 31 March 2016, 9% 2015: 7% of the Groups investment portfolio was held in direct property investments.
At March 2016, 91% 2015: 93% of the Groups investment portfolio is held in listed securities which are predominantly readily realisable.

TR Property Investment Trust 79 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Financial Instruments continued 11.4 Liquidity Risk continued Management of the risk The Manager sets guidelines for the maximum exposure of the portfolio to unquoted and direct property investments.
These are set out in the Investment Policies on page 25.
All unquoted investments and direct property investments with a value over 5 million must be approved by the Board for purchase.
The Company maintains regular contact with the banks providing revolving facilities and renewal discussions commence well ahead of facility renewal dates.
In addition the Company is exploring new opportunities for the provision of debt on an ongoing basis.
11.5 Credit Risk The failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
At the period end the largest counterparty risk, which the Group was exposed to was within Debtors and Cash and cash equivalents where the total bank balances held with one counterparty was 22,094,000 2015: 11,711,000.
Management of the risk Investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Cash at bank is only held with banks with high quality external credit ratings.
Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts in the Balance Sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum Sheet exposure Sheet exposure 000 000 000 000 Debtors 28,978 28,978 20,882 20,882 Cash and cash equivalents 22,754 22,754 21,427 21,427 Fixed interest investments 951 951 6,998 6,998 52,683 52,683 49,307 49,307 Offsetting disclosures In order to better define its contractual rights and to secure rights that will help the Group mitigate its counterparty risk, the Group may enter into an ISDA Master Agreement or similar agreement with its OTC derivative contract counterparties.
An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement between the Group and the counterparty that governs OTC derivatives and foreign exchange contracts and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and or termination event.
Under an ISDA Master Agreement, the Group has a contractual right to offset with the counterparty certain derivative financial instruments payables and or receivables with collateral held and or posted and create one single net payment in the event of default including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.
However, bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency or other events.
The disclosures set out in the following tables include financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.

The fair values of the listed investments are derived from the closing price or last traded price at which the securities are quoted on the London Stock Exchange and other recognised exchanges.
The fair value of contracts for difference are based on the underlying listed investment value as set out above and the amount due from or to the counterparty under the contract is recorded as an asset or liability accordingly.
The fair values of the properties are derived from an open market Red Book valuation of the properties on the Balance Sheet date by an independent firm of valuers Deloitte.
There was one unquoted investment at the Balance Sheet date, Nanette Real Estate, with a total value of 2,000 2015: 86,000.
