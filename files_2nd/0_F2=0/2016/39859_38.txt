NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2016 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 80.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling and under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and derivative financial instruments.
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a profit of 282.9 million 2015: 103.8 million in the year.
GOING CONCERN The Groups business activities, together with the factors affecting performance, financial position and future development are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 39.
The financial position of the Group including cash flow, liquidity, borrowings, undrawn facilities and debt maturity analysis is set out on pages 56 to 62.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES The Groups significant accounting policies are stated below.
Not all of these significant accounting policies require the directors to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
However, the directors consider the valuation of investment properties to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved and its impact on the financial statements.
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Groups wholly-owned portfolio is valued by its external valuers, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited.
Knight Frank LLP value the investment properties owned by the Longmartin Joint Venture.
The valuations are used as the basis for the fair value of the investment properties.
The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental income.
As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction flow in the commercial property market.
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited and Knight Frank LLP make a number of assumptions in forming their opinion on the valuation of our investment properties, which are detailed in the Basis of Valuation on pages 154 to 155.
These assumptions are in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards.
However, if any assumptions made by the external valuers prove to be incorrect, this may mean that the value of the Groups properties differs from their valuation reported in the financial statements, which could have a material effect on the Groups financial position.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of impairment loss.
NET PROPERTY INCOME Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases, recognised on an accruals basis, and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants, where the Group acts as principal.
Rents are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period of the lease, being the earlier of its expiry date or the date of the first break option.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent-free periods.
Irrecoverable property costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Share-based remuneration The cost of granting share options to employees is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the net asset value non-market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted, using the modified binomial option pricing model.
At the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on actual and forecast net asset values.
The impact of any revision to original estimates is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The fair value of the total shareholder return market based vesting condition is calculated when the options are granted using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, using various assumptions as set out in note 27.
The fair value is charged on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
No adjustment is made to the original estimate for market based conditions after the date of grant, regardless of whether the options vest or not.
The amount charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share-based payments reserve.
Following the exercise of share options, the charges previously recognised in respect of those options are released from the share-based payments reserve to retained earnings.
Pension contributions Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shaftesbury Annual Report 2016 125 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs, and are revalued annually to reflect fair value.
Fair value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end.
The fair value, as determined by the valuers, is reduced for any unamortised lease incentive balances.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment properties.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in future economic benefits which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written-off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are capitalised if they arise in connection with a value-enhancing project, otherwise they are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amounts received by way of compensation for dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
All of the Groups leases to its tenants are operating leases except where the Group grants long leasehold interests to tenants, in which case, as substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant, the property is not recognised as an investment property.
ACQUISITIONS Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets other than investment property and liabilities, and without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
JOINT VENTURES Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
On initial recognition the investment is recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss of, and dividends from, the joint venture after the date of acquisition.
The Groups investment in joint ventures is presented separately on the Balance Sheet and the Groups share of the joint ventures post-tax profit or loss for the year is also presented separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where there is an indication that the Groups investment in joint ventures may be impaired, the Group evaluates the recoverable amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint ventures fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
If the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, the investment in joint venture is stated at cost less any provisions for impairment loss.
TRADE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits.
Where such deposits can be offset against any amounts owing to the same bank in accordance with its loan agreement, and in the event of settlement the Group intends to settle as a net liability, they are deducted from that loan liability.
Cash which is held on deposit that has certain conditions restricting its use and is not available on demand, liquid or readily convertible, is classified as other receivables.
BORROWINGS AND COSTS OF RAISING FINANCE Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
Issue costs and premiums are written-off to the Statement of Comprehensive Income using an effective interest rate method.
126 Shaftesbury Annual Report 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swaps for hedging purposes, are measured at fair value.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of a similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
In view of the similar characteristics and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable segment based on net property income and investment property valuation.
Financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements.

All properties were valued on the basis of fair value and highest and best use in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards - Professional Standards 2014 and IFRS 13.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer considers its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer considers the use a market participant would have in mind when formulating the price it would bid and reflects the cost and likelihood of achieving that use.
The external valuers use information provided by the Group, such as tenancy information and capital expenditure expectations.
The valuers, in forming their opinion make a series of assumptions.
The assumptions are typically market related, such as yields and rental values, and are based on the valuers professional judgement and market observations.
The major inputs to the external valuation are reviewed by the senior management team.
In addition, the valuers meet with external auditors and members of the Audit Committee.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Audit Committee Report on pages 90 to 93.
A summary of the DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited report can be found on pages 156 to 157.
Fees were agreed at fixed amounts in advance of the valuations being carried out.
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited was not engaged by the Group in any capacity other than as valuers during the year.
It is noted that Cushman and Wakefield of whom DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited form part are the letting agents for Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC and Shaftesbury Soho Limited.
The fees payable by the Group to Cushman and Wakefield including DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited do not constitute a significant part of their fee income.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties has primarily been determined using a Market Approach, which provides an indication of value by comparing the subject asset with identical or similar assets for which price information is available.
There are a number of assumptions that are made in deriving the fair value, including equivalent yields and ERVs.
Equivalent yields are based on current market prices, depending on, inter alia, the location and use of the property.
ERVs are calculated using a number of factors which include current rental income, market comparatives and occupancy.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs, and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, these significant inputs are deemed unobservable.
The Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within Level 3 of the hierarchy in IFRS 13, as set out below.
The Groups policy is to recognise transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There have been no transfers during the year.
HIERARCHY DESCRIPTION Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine fair values of these instruments.
The key assumptions made by the valuers are set out in the Basis of Valuation on pages 154 to 155.
The Groups acquisition and capital expenditure activity is discussed on pages 50 to 52.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS As noted in the critical judgements, assumptions and estimates section on page 124, the valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective.
132 Shaftesbury Annual Report 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 10 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES CONTINUED The Groups properties are all located in Londons West End and are virtually all multi-use buildings, usually configured with commercial uses on the lower floors and office and or residential uses on the upper floors.
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited value properties in their entirety and not by use, consequently the sensitivity analysis below has been performed on the Groups portfolio as a whole.
CHANGE IN CHANGE IN ERV EQUIVALENT YIELDS 5.0% -5.0% 0.25% -0.25% M M M M Increase decrease in the fair value of investment properties 135.7 136.2 210.3 238.3 These key unobservable inputs are inter-dependent.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to a decrease in the valuation of a property, and an increase in the ERV would increase the capital value, and vice versa.
At 30 September 2016, the Group had capital commitments of 31.3 million 2015: 16.4 million.

Two of the Companys subsidiaries each have secured term loans.
Both entities have granted fixed charges over certain of their investment properties, with a carrying value of 1,116.5 million 2015: 1,060.7 million, and cash balances, and floating charges over their assets as security for their respective loans.
Additionally, the two shareholders of these subsidiaries have granted a charge over the shares in these companies.
Following an EGM of holders of the 61.0 million Debenture Stock in September 2016, the terms and conditions of the Stock were amended to grant Shaftesbury an option to redeem the Stock in full at an agreed amount, conditional upon an issue of newly created longer-dated Guaranteed First Mortgage Bonds or an equivalent cash alternative.
As a result of the substantial modification to the expected future cash flows of the Debenture Stock, the Company fide-recognised the book value of the Stock, which was previously held in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost.
It then recognised the fair value of the Stock, being the total consideration to be paid to the holders of the Stock.
This resulted in an increase in the recognised liability of 29.2 million, compared with the previous book value.
This increase comprised the redemption premium of 31.1 million, less the unamortised premium in respect of the original Stock of 1.9 million.
This was charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year ended 30 September 2016.
The fair value of the Stock, which represents the new basis for amortised cost, is included in the Balance Sheet within current liabilities, as the directors considered the condition of the issue of newly created Guaranteed First Mortgage Bonds was highly likely to be met within one year of the Balance Sheet date.
On 7 October 2016, Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC, a subsidiary of Shaftesbury PLC, issued 285 million of Guaranteed First Mortgage Bonds the Bonds with a coupon of 2.487% and maturity in September 2031.
The Bonds are secured by fixed charges over the properties held by Shaftesbury Carnaby PLC and a floating charge over Shaftesbury Carnaby PLCs assets.
They also benefit from an unsecured guarantee from Shaftesbury PLC.
On the same day, the Companys existing 61.0 million Debenture Stock was redeemed in full, being satisfied by existing holders of the Stock exchanging their Stock for new Bonds, or taking cash.
Of the 285 million proceeds raised by the issue of the new Bonds, 92.2 million was used to redeem the existing Stock.
This was satisfied by 10.4 million of cash and 81.8 million of new Bonds.
The fixed and floating charges relating to the Stock were released.

The Group and Company also incur non-utilisation fees on undrawn facilities.
At 30 September 2016, the weighted average charge on the undrawn facilities of 59.3 million 2015: 150.3 million for the Group was 0.70% 2015: 0.70%, and 0.70% 2015: 0.70% on the undrawn facilities of 59.3 million 2015: 143.0 million for the Company.

The swaps, which are settled against three month LIBOR, expire between August 2028 and November 2038.
If mutual break or counterparty early termination options are exercised the weighted average term is 3.1 years 2015: 4.1 years.
In October 2016, the Group and Company terminated interest rate swap contracts with a notional principal of 55.0 million.
These swaps, with an average rate of 4.76%, had expiry dates between August 2028 and November 2038, and included counterparty early termination options in November 2018.
The cost of terminating these swaps was 34.1 million.
They were included in the Balance Sheet at 30 September 2016 at a fair value of 38.0 million.
Details of the Groups current financial position are discussed on pages 60 to 62.

The extent to which the fair value deficit will crystallise will depend on the course of interest rates over the life of the swaps.
The weighted average maturity of the swaps at the Balance Sheet date is set out in note 17.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps has been estimated using the mid-point of the relevant yield curve prevailing at the reporting date, and represents the net present value of the differences between the contractual rate and the valuation rate through to the contracted expiry date of the swap contract.
The valuation technique falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy see note 10 for definition.
Interest rate swaps are the only financial instruments which are held at fair value.
There have been no transfers between hierarchy levels during the year 2015: none.
The 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock is held at amortised cost.
This was remeasured in September 2016, following modifications to the terms of the Stock see note 17.
The Groups secured term loans are held at amortised cost in the Balance Sheet.
The fair value of liability in excess of book value which is not recognised in the reported results for the year is 52.5 million 2015: 39.1 million.
The fair values have been calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using the relevant reference gilt and appropriate market spread.
The Group has no obligation to repay its secured term loans in advance of their maturities on 2 May 2029, 19 March 2030, and 31 July 2035.
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, and those financial instruments included within trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings, including the 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock but excluding the secured term loans, and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.

The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 14.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired are expected to be fully recoverable.
The Group tends to hold minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day-to-day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 35 and 60 to 62.
144 Shaftesbury Annual Report 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 19 MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS GROUP AND COMPANY CONTINUED MARKET RISK Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long-term fixed rate debt, long-term committed bank facilities and the use of long-term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
The Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
Details of the Groups interest and hedging arrangements are set out in note 18.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates on its unhedged LIBOR-linked borrowings and a change in the long-term interest rates against which the fair value of swaps is calculated at the Balance Sheet date.
It represents the directors assessment of possible changes in interest rates and the potential impact on the Groups results and equity.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The capital structure of the Group consists of equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 17 and the Groups equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group regularly reviews its loan covenant compliance.
The Groups capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The Groups capital structure such as levels of gearing and loan-to-value ratios are discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 35 and 62.

The following describes the nature and purpose of each of the reserves within equity.
RESERVE DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE Share premium Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received for ordinary shares exceeds the nominal value of shares issued, net of expenses.
Share-based payments reserve The equity-settled remuneration expense charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share-based payments reserve.
Upon exercise of options, the expense previously recognised is transferred to retained earnings.
Retained earnings Cumulative gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transfers from the share-based payments reserve are also credited to this account.

In accordance with EPRA recommendations, the adjustment for the fair value of derivatives excludes those interest rate swaps which were cancelled in October 2016 see note 17.
The comparative figure for the fair value of secured term loans has been restated by 8.2 million to include the fair value in excess of book value for the debt in the joint venture.
This has decreased EPRA NNNAV net assets by 8.2 million and EPRA NNNAV net asset value per share by 0.03.
