Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 July 2016 1 Accounting policies  The financial statements of Softcat plc for the year ended 31 July 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 19October 2016.
Softcat plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office isSolarHouse, Fieldhouse Lane, Marlow, Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom.
The principal activity of the Company continued to be that of a value-added IT reseller and IT infrastructure solutions provider to the corporate and public sector markets.
 These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are presented in the Companys presentational and functional currency of Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000, except when otherwise stated.
The Company applied all standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that were effective as of 31 July 2016.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Going concern For reasons noted on page 66, the financial information has been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
At the date of approving the financial statements, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances that could lead to the Company being unable to settle commitments as they fall due during the twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
 When applying the Companys accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements involving estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience that may differ significantly from the actual outcome.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include: Revenue cut off The Companys management information systems are configured to recognise revenue upon notification of dispatch from the supplier or distributor which ininstances, especially regarding physical shipments, may not be aligned to when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Under IFRS the point of recognition on physical shipments should be aligned to the date of delivery, not dispatch.
Management therefore performs an exercise to capture items that may have been dispatched from distributor but not delivered in the financial year, and subsequently defers the recognition of revenue into the following year.
The exercise applied includes several assumptions, which management believes are reasonable, in order to identify items that fit the criteria for deferral.
Separately management reviews individual large deals on a case by case basis which reduces the opportunity for error.
 At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, see below IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 2 Amendments Share-based Payments IAS 12 Amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IAS 7 Amendments Statement of Cash Flows IFRS 16 Leases Annual Improvements 20122014 Cycle IAS 16 and IAS 38 Amendment Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 77 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2016 1 Accounting policies continued  continued  The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements ofthe Company, except for: IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 may have an impact on the Companys revenue recognition policies and disclosures: however, until managements detailed review has been completed it is not practicable to provide details of the impact that its adoption will have on the Companys financial statements.
IFRS16Leases Replacing IAS 17, IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 specifies how to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with the exception of those with a lease term of less than twelve months or the underlying asset has a low value.
Softcat is a lessee on lease arrangements for all its offices, with the exception of its head office in Marlow, for which it owns the freehold.
These leases typically have a five-year lease term and therefore it is expected that following adoption of IFRS 16, Softcat would recognise both an asset and a liability onitsStatement of Financial Position relating to these leases.
 Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty.
The Company assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods The Company sells hardware and software that is sourced from and delivered by a number of suppliers.
Revenue from the sale of these goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.
The Company has primary responsibility for the acceptability of goods sold, is exposed to inventory risk during the delivery period, establishes the selling price itself and bears the customers credit risk.
It is therefore considered to be acting as principal in these sales and revenue is measured using the price charged to the customer, excluding sales tax.
Provision of services The Company also provides datacentre, cloud and software services.
Revenue in respect of these services is recognised when the service has been satisfactorily completed or in line with the stage of completed work.
It is measured at either the sales prices, excluding sales taxes, or by reference tothe costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract.
In addition, the Company sells services provided by third parties.
Revenue for services provided by third parties is recognised at the point of sale to the customer, as the Company has no ongoing obligations.
The Company establishes the selling price and is exposed to customer credit risk on this revenue andtherefore considers itself to be acting as principal, measuring revenue as the price charged to the customer, excluding sales tax.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate EIR applicable.
EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
Interest income is included in finance income in the income statement.
78 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued 1.6Costofsales The Company recognises cost of sales at the point in which it recognises revenue as explained above.
Cost of sales predominantly relates to the cost of goods and services purchased from suppliers and then sold to customers.
In addition to these costs, the following elements are also included within cost of sales: Rebates Included within cost of sales are rebates received from commercial partners.
Further details are provided on rebates in 1.7, below.
Managed service infrastructure costs The Company operates its own network operating centre which facilitates the selling of Softcat hosted managed services.
The costs of maintaining this ability include, but are not limited to, the rental of space in data warehouses, energy and licensing costs.
These costs represent the cost of sale of selling hosted managed service solutions and are included within cost of sales.
Marketing costs and related credits The Company carries out numerous training programmes, activities and schemes that aim to educate its sale force and internally promote the products the business resells.
These activities are often funded by the Companys partners.
Both the cost of the programmes borne by the Company and the credits received, where applicable, are included within cost of sales.
Settlement discounts Through the normal course of business, the Company receives credits from distributors and suppliers for the prompt settlement of invoices.
Softcat recognises these discounts in cost of sales as they are recognised as a reduction in the cost of goods sold.
1.7Rebates Rebates from suppliers are accounted for in the period in which they are earned and are based on commercial agreements with suppliers.
Rebates earned are mainly sales volume related and are generally short term in nature, with rebate earned but not yet received typically relating to the preceding quarters trading.
Rebate income is recognised in cost of sales in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and rebate earned but not yet received is included within accrued income in the Statement of Financial Position.
1.8Property, plantandequipment Property, plant and equipment other than freehold land is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and or impairment losses, if any.
If the costs ofcertain components of an item of property, plant and equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Building improvements remaining period of lease ten years straight line Computer equipment threefive years straight line Fixtures, fittings and equipment six years straight line Motor vehicles three years straight line Land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
Building improvements relate to expenditure on improving both leasehold property and the freehold property of Solar House in Marlow.
Improvements to Solar House are depreciated over a ten-year period, which represents their useful life.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their useful life which isthe lesser of the remaining length of the lease or ten years.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for reasonableness at each financial year end and adjusted for prospectively if appropriate.
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 79 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2016 1 Accounting policies continued 1.9Intangibleassets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Amortisation is provided for at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: Computer software threefive years straight line The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
1.10Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if payments are not made on such abasis.
Onerous property leases are provided for in the Statement of Financial Position and represent the present value of the onerous element of an operating lease.
This arises when the Company ceases to use premises and they are left vacant to the end of the lease.
At inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease.
At inception or on reassessment of the arrangement that contains a lease, the Company separates payments and other consideration required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values.
1.11Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, lessestimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell.
Inventories are predominantly goods in transit and items for which a customer purchase order has been received but the goods have yet to be delivered tothe customer.
 Financialassets The Companys financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade other receivables.
All financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
i Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in administrative expenses.
ii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts.
Financialliabilities Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
i Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts.
80 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued 1.14Pensions The pension costs charged in the financial statements represent the contributions payable by the Company during the year on the defined contribution pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The amounts charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period and represents the full extent of the Companys liability.
1.15Deferredtaxation Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with inequity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities.
1.16Currenttaxation Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
 Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
All differences are taken to the income statement.
 During the year the Company operated the following equity-settled share option schemes: Company Share Option Plan CSOP The Company Share Option Plan provides share options for nominated employees.
The purchase price is set at a mid-market price on the date of grant.
TheCSOP operates both approved and unapproved schemes with vesting dependent on continued employment with the Company.
Options typically vest between one and three years and lapse after ten years from the date of grant.
The fair value of the CSOP options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and is charged as an expense in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan for employees who were awarded free shares following the initial public offering in November 2015.
Shares were allocated to employees on the basis of length of service.
Free shares awarded to an employee under the SIP are subject to a holding period ending not earlier than the third anniversary and not later than the fifth anniversary of the date on which beneficial interest in the relevant ordinary shares is conferred by the SIP Trustee to the employee.
The fair value of the SIP shares is determined by the share price at date of grant, on 9 December 2015, and the number of shares expected to be transferred following the three-year vesting period.
The assumption used for expected leavers within three years from the date of award has been calculated with reference to historical employee retention rates.
The resulting fair value charge is charged as an expense in the income statement over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 81 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2016 1 Accounting policies continued  continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Details in relation to the Softcat Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 45.
The awards will only vest and become exercisable upon achievement of performance targets, linked to earnings per share and total shareholder return, as well as being conditional upon continued employment with the Company.
The fair value is measured using a suitable valuation model where appropriate.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of LTIP shares expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of LTIP shares that will eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the LTIP shares granted.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
 The Company operates an Employee Benefit Trust and a SIP trust for the benefit of eligible employees.
The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of these trusts asits own until such assets held vest unconditionally with identified beneficiaries.
The Company meets all costs incurred by the trusts.
1.19Companyaccounts Softcat plc is a single entity with no subsidiary undertakings.
The Employee Benefit and SIP trusts, which hold shares on behalf of employees, are not consolidated within the results of Softcat plc and instead are treated as extensions of the Company.
1.20Exceptionalitems Items that are material in size and unusual in nature are included within operating profit and disclosed separately in the income statement.
The separate reporting of these items helps to provide a more accurate indication of the underlying business performance.
2 Segmental information The information reported to the Companys Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance, is based wholly on the overall activities of the Company.
The Company has therefore determined that it has only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is that of value-added IT reseller and IT infrastructure solutions provider.
The Companys revenue and results and assets for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position.
An analysis of revenues by product, which form one reportable segment, is set out below: 2016 2015 Revenue by type: 000 000 Software 319,978 287,469 Hardware 250,692 223,845 Services 101,681 84,770 672,351 596,084 The total revenue for the Company for the year has been derived from its principal activity as an IT reseller.

Non-deductible expenses in the year predominantly relate to the legal and accountancy costs associated with the initial public offering.
Changes affecting the future tax charge In the FY15 Summer Budget the Chancellor announced a further reduction to the corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
These rates were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore these have been measured at 19%.

The primary purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Companys operations.
The Company has trade and other receivables and cash that derive directly from its operations.
Financialassets The financial assets of the Company were as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 62,361 74,642 Trade and other receivables 132,787 121,952 195,148 196,594 The Directors consider that the carrying amount for all financial assets approximates to their fair value.
Financialliabilities The financial liabilities of the Company were as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Trade payables 67,759 71,213 Accruals 24,000 23,361 91,759 94,574 The Directors consider that the carrying amount for all financial liabilities approximates to their fair value.
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Companys senior management oversees the management of these risks and ensures that the Companys financial risk taking is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Company policies and Company risk appetite.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below: Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At the year end the Company has no borrowings and therefore the exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the rates received as interest income on cash deposits.
The Company accepts the risk of losing interest on deposits due to interest rate reductions.
Due to the limited exposure to interest rate risk no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.
Foreigncurrencyrisk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk when dealing with customers and suppliers who wish to be billed in a currency other than Pounds Sterling.
As the vast majority of transactions are with UK customers and are denominated in Pounds Sterling, the Directors consider this foreign currency risk to be small and do not hedge this risk due to the limited exposure.
The level of foreign currency transactions is monitored closely to ensure that the level of exposure is manageable.
Due to the limited exposure to currency risk no sensitivity analysis has been prepared.
Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 91 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 July 2016 20 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued  continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Company isexposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily for trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Trade receivables Credit risk from trade receivables is managed in accordance with the Companys established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.
A customers credit quality is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.
At 31 July 2016, the Company had 871 accounts 2015: 853 that owed the Company more than 25,000 each.
These accounts accounted for approximately 14% 2015: 14% of total customers and 82% 2015: 81% of the total value of amounts receivable.
There were 250 customers 2015: 218 customers with balances greater than 100,000 accounting for just over 4% 2015: 4% of the total number of receivable accounts and 58% 2015: 54% of the total value of amounts receivable.
The requirement for impairment is analysed at each reporting date.
The calculation is based on actual incurred historical data.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
The Company evaluates theconcentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low as there is limited reliance on single, or a few, customers: instead, sales are typically small insize but large in volume as are the number of customers.
This is illustrated by the fact that no more than 3% of receivables are due from any one customer at the year end.
 Credit risk from cash balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with Company policy.
The Company has significant cash reserves which are accessible immediately and without restriction.
Credit risk with respect to cash deposits is managed by carefully selecting the institutions with which cash is deposited and spreading its deposits across more than one such institution to ease concentration risk.
Liquidity risk The Company generates positive cash flows from operating activities and these fund short-term working capital requirements.
The Company aims to maintain significant cash reserves and none of its cash reserves are subject to restrictions.
Access to cash is not restricted and could all be drawn upon immediately ifso required.
The Board carefully monitors the levels of cash deposits and is comfortable that for normal operating requirements, no external borrowings are currently required.
The following table details the Companys remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities based on undiscounted contractual payments: Within 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Over 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 2016 Trade payables 67,759 67,759 Accruals 24,000 24,000 91,759 91,759 2015 Trade payables 71,213 71,213 Accruals 23,361 23,361 94,574 94,574 In both the current year and the prior year, materially all of the financial liabilities above have a contractual settlement date of between zero and three months.

The Company also operates a SIP for employees who received free shares in the year and for those that have decided to participate in the partnership shares programme.
The Company recognised the following expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions: 2016 2015 000 000 CSOP 79 5 LTIP 199 SIP free shares scheme 294 572 5 Employers National Insurance contributions payable on all schemes 316 888 5 All options vest at the end of the vesting period relating to that option or on the occurrence of a contingent event.
This includes substantial sale or substantial business asset sale.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, the vesting of theseshare options is dependent on continued employment.
Following the public listing of shares in the Company, share options become readily convertible assets for which the Company is liable for employers National Insurance contributions.
The Company accrues for National Insurance contributions on a straight-line basis from the date of award to the vesting date.
Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP provides share options for nominated employees.
Thisisan approved scheme and vesting is unconditional.
Optionsare forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the options vest.
At 31 July 2016, share options outstanding under the CSOP were as follows: No.
The fair value of the CSOP options granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes model, incorporating relevant assumptions for weighted average share price, weighted average exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and share option term.
The resultant fair value was then spread over the relevant performance period for each tranche of share options.
The fair value of CSOP options granted in the year is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: 2016 CSOP Share price 1.06 Weighted average exercise price at grant date 1.05 Expected dividend yield 4.71% Risk-free interest rate 0.50% Expected volatility 40.00% Term 10 years During the year 500,000 2015: 200,000 CSOP options were granted.
These shares had an exercise price of 1.05 at the date of grant, 25 August 2015, and a performance period of between one and two years.
94 Softcat plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 24 Share option schemes continued Company Share Option Plan CSOP continued The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, restrictions and behavioural considerations at the date of granting the options.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the term commensurate with the expected term immediately prior to the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Details in relation to the Softcat Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 awards to Executive Directors are included in the Directors Remuneration report on page 45.

During the year 350,000 2015: nil share options related to LTIP schemes were issued to two Executive Directors at nil exercise price with a performance period of three years.
The performance conditions on these awards include the Executive Directors continued employment at the date of vesting: and satisfaction of the performance conditions which are linked to earnings per share and total shareholder return over the vesting period.
These shares have been valued atthe market price at date of grant and management is comfortable that the value established is not materially different from a more complex approach.
Management assumes these LTIPs will vest in full with the charge to the income statement spread over the vesting period with a corresponding entry in equity.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company operates a SIP for employees who were awarded free shares following the initial public offering in November 2015.
Historical employee attrition rates have been used to calculate the expected number of shares expected to vest.
