2 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,412,359 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as Own shares 2015: 378,328,541.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 378,412,359 shares 2015: 378,475,804, which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of nil 2015: 147,263.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares were calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets: acquisition items: profit or loss on disposal of operations: and the associated taxation thereon.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic earnings per share figures is as follows: Per ordinary share 53 weeks to 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 2 April 28 March 2 April 28 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 pence pence Earnings from continuing operations 108,841 104,001 28.76 27.49 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax 16,102 14,121 4.26 3.73 Acquisition transaction costs after tax 2,941 1,423 0.78 0.38 Release of fair value adjustments to inventory after tax 998 474 0.26 0.13 Adjustments to contingent consideration after tax 1,315 1,162 0.35 0.31 Profit on disposal of operations after tax 556 945 0.15 0.25 Adjusted earnings 129,641 117,912 34.26 31.17 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 121 119 Notes to the Accounts continued 3 NON-GAAP MEASURES The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group.

122 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 120 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Accounts continued 3 NON-GAAP MEASURES continued Organic growth Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations.
At the year end, the method for calculating organic growth was changed.
The revised method equalises the effect of acquisitions by: i. removing from the year of acquisition their entire revenue and profit before taxation, and ii.
in the following year, removing the revenue and profit for the number of months equivalent to the pre-acquisition period in the prior year.
The resultant effect is that the acquisitions are removed from organic results for one full year of ownership.
The results of disposals are removed from the prior period reported revenue and profit before taxation.
The effects of currency changes are removed through restating the current year revenue and profit before taxation at the prior year exchange rates.
Organic growth at constant currency has been calculated as follows: Adjusted profit Revenue before taxation 53 weeks to 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 2 April 2 April 28 March 28 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 % growth 000 000 % growth Continuing operations 807,805 726,134 166,014 153,618 Acquired and disposed revenue profit 27,070 1,124 4,376 64 Organic growth 780,735 725,010 7.7% 161,638 153,682 5.2% Constant currency adjustment 14,466 2,725 Organic growth at constant currency 766,269 725,010 5.7% 158,913 153,682 3.4% Adjustments include the amortisation of acquired intangible assets: acquisition items: and profit or loss on disposal of operations.

Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups as follows: 2 April 28 March 2016 2015 000 000 Process Safety Gas Detection Bursting Discs 8,157 7,826 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 54,147 51,826 62,304 59,652 Infrastructure Safety Fire 48,919 22,711 Doors, Security and Elevators 67,609 63,912 116,528 86,623 Medical Health Optics 157,358 125,581 Fluid Technology 37,368 34,746 Sensor Technologies 67,280 262,006 160,327 Environmental & Analysis Water 28,757 28,089 Photonics 61,565 58,931 Environmental Monitoring 13,099 12,568 103,421 99,588 Total Group 544,259 406,190 Sensor Technologies is a new CGU following the acquisition of CenTrak in the year.
Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGU group.
The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate their net present value.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 129 127 Notes to the Accounts continued 11 GOODWILL continued Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to March 2017: Discount rates: and Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to March 2017 and relate to revenue forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins in each of the operating companies.
The relative value ascribed to each assumption will vary between CGUs as the budgets are built up from the underlying operating companies within each CGU group.
A short-term growth rate is applied to the March 2017 budget to derive the cash flows arising in the year to March 2018 and a long-term rate is applied to these values for the year to March 2019 and onwards, as described below.
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would make, using the Groups economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 10.79% 2015: 9.72%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Discount rates are adjusted for economic risks that are not already captured in the specific operating assumptions for each CGU group.
This results in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 9.86% to 14.00% 2015: 10.10% to 12.91% across the CGU groups.
CGU groups to which 10% or more of the total goodwill balance is allocated are deemed to be significant.
The assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGU groups are: Risk adjusted discount rate Short-term growth rates Long-term growth rates 2 April 28 March 2 April 28 March 2 April 28 March Significant CGU groups 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring 12.29% 11.49% 11.65 % 7.20% 2.33% 2.79% Doors, Security and Elevators 12.95% 10.58% 5.18% 7.20% 1.92% 2.15% Health Optics 14.00% 12.91% 5.18% 7.20% 2.06% 2.35% Photonics 11.26% 11.68% 5.18% 3.26 % 1.86% 2.17% Sensor Technologies 12.93% 13.7% 2.31% Sensor Technologies is a new CGU following the acquisition of CenTrak in the year.
Short-term growth rates for all CGU groups, with the exception of Sensor Technologies, are based on sectoral organic growth rates achieved in the current year, but are capped at the Groups overall current year organic growth rate to ensure that future uncertainties are adequately reflected.
Safety Interlocks and Corrosion Monitoring CGU is in the Process Safety sector which was impacted by the challenging energy market conditions in the year and therefore the short-term growth rate is based on the organic decline for that sector: It is expected to improve in the future.
Long-term growth rates are capped at the weighted average GDP growth rates of the markets that the Group sells into.
Sensor Technologies is a new CGU in the year following the acquisition of CenTrak.
Growth rates are based on forecasts at the acquisition date.
An average short-term growth rate of 14% per year has been applied over the years to March 2018, trending to an average long-term growth rate of 2% thereafter.
This reflects the companys growth strategy of further market penetration into the USA, international expansion and, in the longer term, new applications in other sectors.
SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The remaining amortisation periods for these assets are eight years, twelve years, nine years, ten years and ten years respectively.
2 Technical know-how assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, estimated to be between three and ten years.
Within this balance individually material items relate to RCS which has a carrying value of 9,708,000 2015: 10,466,000 and CenTrak with a carrying value of 24,389,000.
The remaining amortisation periods for these assets are eight years and ten years respectively.
3 Trademarks, brands and patents which include protected intellectual property are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between eight and ten years.
There are no individually material items within this balance.
4 Internally generated capitalised development costs are amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be three years.
There are no individually material items within this balance, which comprises capitalised costs arising from the development phase of the R&D projects undertaken by the Group.
5 Other intangibles comprise licence and product registration costs amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and five years.

As one of the largest shareholders, the Group continues to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the company and so continues to apply the equity method of accounting for its interest.
Later during the year another investor exercised an option over outstanding warrants, further diluting the Groups ownership to 26.7% at the year-end as disclosed below.
Following the part disposal, Optomed continues to be classified as an investment in associate and therefore, as required by IAS 28, following this transaction the Group did not remeasure the carrying value of its investment.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

Contingent purchase consideration The provision at the beginning of the year comprised 9,484,000 falling due within one year and 166,000 falling due after one year.
The additional provision charged in the year related mainly to a change in the contingent consideration on the Advanced acquisition from 3,356,000 to 4,183,000.
The 16,725,000 utilisation relates mainly to settling the 4,183,000 Advanced consideration in cash and loan notes, a payment of 6,001,000 in full and final settlement of the contingent consideration for MST and 6,558,000 paid into escrow in relation to the Visiometrics acquisition see note 24.
The 111,000 release of provision related mainly to a revision to the estimate for the third earn out payment for the acquisition of ASL from 197,000 to 86,000.
Of the closing total provision of 17,075,000, 86,000 is due within one year for the acquisition of ASL.
Of the balance due after more than one year, 704,000 relating to VAS and 1,136,000 relating to Visiometrics is due within one to two years and the remainder, relating to Visiometrics, is payable annually for four years thereafter.
Dilapidations and empty property Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them.
The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2016 to 2028 though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period.
The provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.
136 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 134 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Accounts continued 19 PROVISIONS continued Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other provisions comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

Further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 18% effective from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted in the UK Finance No.
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK.
However, 29,155,000 2015: 19,422,000 of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3,192,000 2015: 3,399,000 of which only 660,000 has been provided as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with the interest in associate are insignificant.
At 2 April 2016 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 155,000 2015: 479,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Executive share plan ESP During the year ended 2 April 2016 the Group introduced the ESP in which Executive directors and certain senior employees participate.
Awards made under this Plan are either performance awards or deferred awards.
Performance awards vest after three years based on Earnings Per Share and Return on Total Invested Capital ROTIC targets, and after two or three years for deferred share awards based on the continuing service of the employee only.
Awards which do not vest, lapse on the second or third anniversary of their grant.

Cash settled Awards under the above plans are normally settled in shares but may be settled in cash at the Boards discretion or where required by local regulations.
Cash settled awards follow the same vesting conditions as the plans under which they are awarded.
24 ACQUISITIONS In accounting for acquisitions, adjustments are made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their fair values to the Group.
Acquired inventories are valued at fair value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading are recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition are included and accounting policies are aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.
The Group made four acquisitions during the year: Value Added Solutions LLC VAS : Firetrace USA, LLC Firetrace : Visiometrics, S. L. Visiometrics : and CenTrak Inc. CenTrak.
The four acquisitions in the year contributed 21,798,000 of revenue and 3,128,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 2 April 2016.
If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 38,362,000 and 5,565,000 higher respectively.
The combined fair value adjustments made for all acquisitions, excluding acquired intangible assets recognised and deferred tax thereon, resulted in net adjustments to goodwill of negative 3,262,000.

Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired shown below approximate to the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 revised.
919,000 and 17,297,000 of goodwill arising on the acquisitions of VAS and Firetrace respectively are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
As at the date of approval of the financial statements, the acquisition accounting for VAS and all prior year acquisitions is complete.
Other than VAS, the accounting for certain balances on current year acquisitions is provisional.
These balances mainly comprise the valuation of CenTraks acquired intangible assets, as a result of the proximity of its acquisition date to the year end, and the initial considerations which are subject to the net tangible asset adjustments and other contractual clauses being agreed.

Initial consideration paid for the company was 18,000,000 13,144,000 adjustable for the final agreed value of net tangible assets and cash at closing, for which 327,000 239,000 is owed to the Group at the balance sheet date.

Managements current best estimate is that the EBITDA Reserve Goal will be met.
Further contingent consideration is payable based on two elements: Royalty and the Core earn-out.
The Royalty is payable annually over five years to December 2020 at a percentage of the gross margin on sales made to one customer.
The Core earn-out is payable annually over three years to December 2018 based on a multiple of EBITDA over a target threshold.
The estimated payable for the Core earn-out is 11,114,000 8,088,000.
The undiscounted total estimated contingent consideration payable for the EBITDA Reserve Goal, Royalty and Core earn-outs is therefore 30,356,000 22,099,000.
The fair value of contingent consideration payable is estimated based on performance observed to date and the expectation of likely future cash flows, and is discounted at the Groups forecast cost of borrowing over the earn-out period.
The maximum contingent consideration payable is 109,000,000 subject to a maximum total consideration of 125,000,000.

26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographic locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition of income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting Policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 147 145 Notes to the Accounts continued 26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Longer-term funding is provided by the Groups bank loan facilities which are at floating rates, or by the Groups fixed rate United States Private Placement completed in November 2015.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 222,855,000 2015: 186,936,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Liquidity risk The Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility of 360,000,000 with its core group of five banks extending to November 2018.
In addition, in November 2015 the Group completed a United States Private Placement and issued US$250,000,000 of loan notes on 6 January 2016 repayable at five, seven and ten year intervals.
These facilities are the main sources of long-term funding for the Group.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
148 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 146 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 673,000 2015: 561,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to Sterling would have had a 196,000 2015: 214,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 2 April 2016.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly US Dollar and Euro.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 3,318,000 at 2 April 2016 2015: 998,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 115,000 2015: 92,000, and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of 3,203,000 2015: 906,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 50,620,000 2015: 40,232,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 128,208,000 at 2 April 2016 2015: 141,454,000.
All bank loans bear interest at floating rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
The loan notes related to the acquisition of Advanced Electronics Limited outstanding at 2 April 2016 attract interest at a fixed rate of 1%.
The loan notes related to the United States Private Placement attract interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 2.5%.
The Groups weighted average interest cost on net debt for the year was 1.99% 2015: 1.80%.

On 2 November 2015, the Group completed a United States Private Placement of US$250,000,000.
The unsecured loan notes were drawn on 6 January 2016 as 82,000,000, 56,000,000 and US$64,000,000 at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.5%.
The loan notes mature at five, seven and ten year intervals.
Interest is payable half yearly.
The Group has additional short-term unsecured and committed US bank facilities of 17,606,000, which mature in November 2018 and were undrawn at 2 April 2016.
Other short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Groups undrawn committed facilities available at 2 April 2016 were 253,810,000 2015: 237,130,000 of which nil 2015: 16,892,000 matures within one year and 253,810,000 2015: 220,238,000 between two and five years.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 2 April 2016 and 28 March 2015 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value of floating borrowings approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Because of the proximity of issue date to the year-end the fair value of the Groups fixed rate loan notes arising from the United States Private Placement is considered to approximate to the carrying value.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data, and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value of contingent consideration arising on acquisitions is estimated by discounting the possible future cash flows using probability adjusted forecasts for the acquired company, and represents a level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The fair value is sensitive to the weighting assigned to the expected future cash flows.
A change in weighting of 10 percentage points towards the higher expectations would result in an increase in the undiscounted estimate of future cash flows of 7,578,000.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 151 149 Notes to the Accounts continued 26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.

152 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 150 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Accounts continued 26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, Mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro, US Dollar and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
The carrying amount of the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2 April 2 April 28 March 28 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 US Dollar 222,750 169,047 71,800 42,793 Euro 71,512 61,741 18,072 15,488 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 2 April 28 March 2 April 28 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Profit 6,183 5,153 1,796 1,964 Other equity 13,723 11,478 4,858 4,205 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar and Euro because more of the Groups profits are earned in these currencies.

Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2016 and November 2028 and the latter between April 2016 and July 2022.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2 April 28 March 2 April 28 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Within one year 9,095 8,611 396 429 Within two to five years 19,448 19,495 629 503 After five years 8,377 6,151 36,920 34,257 1,025 932 28 RETIREMENT BENEFITS Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan both UK have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections had already closed to new entrants in 2002 03 and closed to future benefit accruals for 2014 15.
From that date, the former defined benefit members joined the existing defined contribution section within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Overseas subsidiaries have adopted mainly defined contribution plans, with the exception of three small defined benefit plans in the Swiss entities of Medicel AG, Robutec GmbH and Robutec AG previously Plasticspritzerei AG.
Total pension costs of 8,213,000 2015: 7,117,000 recognised in employee costs note 7, comprise 7,901,000 2015: 5,616,000 related to defined contribution plans and 312,000 2015: 1,501,000 related to defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution plans was 7,901,000 2015: 5,616,000 and represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group may be reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit plans The Groups significant defined benefit plans are for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The plans are funded plans.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2014 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2015 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
154 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 152 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Accounts continued 28 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued An alternative to the projected unit credit method is a valuation on a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the plan liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the plan.

These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality rates.
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are: 2 April 28 March 29 March 2016 2015 2014 Years Years Years Retiring today: Males 22.5 23.4 23.4 Females 24.5 26.0 25.9 Retiring in 20 years: Males 24.3 25.3 25.2 Females 26.4 27.9 27.9 During the year, the mortality tables used to set the mortality assumptions were changed for the UK plans.
This had the effect of reducing the fair value of the defined benefit obligation by approximately 7,000,000.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the UK plan liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on plan liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% Decrease increase by 9.9% Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 5.2% Rate of salary growth Increase decrease by 0.5% Increase decrease by 0.3% Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 2.8% Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 155 153 Notes to the Accounts continued 28 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the UK and Swiss defined benefit plans are as follows: 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 2 April 28 March 2016 2015 000 000 Current service cost 312 1,501 Net interest charge on pension plan liabilities 2,013 1,419 2,325 2,920 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.

In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension plan.
The results of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the plan.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the plans investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of plan assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of its defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.
