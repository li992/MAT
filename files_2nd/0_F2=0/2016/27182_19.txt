Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Principal activity The Company is a closed-end investment company, registered in Scotland No SC006705, with its Ordinary shares being listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 and with the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling which is the functional currency of the Company and rounded to the nearest 000.
They have also been prepared on a going concern basis and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no exdividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue, according to their circumstances.
In some jurisdictions, investment income and capital gains are subject to withholding tax deducted at the source of the income.
The Company presents the withholding tax separately from the gross investment income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income under taxation.
The fixed returns on debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Expenses are charged against revenue except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged against capital in the Statement of Comprehensive Income: and expenses are treated as a capital item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and ultimately recognised in the capital reserve where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to the capital reserve to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
d Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Any tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Statement of Financial Position date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Statement of Financial Position date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
56 Annual Report 2016 Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Statement of Comprehensive Income on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year, based on the marginal basis.
e Investments The Company has chosen to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as adopted for use in the EU and investments have been designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
This is done because all investments are considered to form part of a group of financial assets which is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Companys documented investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis.
Investments are recognised and fide-recognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments, this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for SETS London Stock Exchanges electronic trading service stocks sourced from the London Stock Exchange.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are treated in net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and are ultimately recognised in the capital reserve.
f Borrowings Short-term borrowings, which comprise interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue expenses, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The finance costs of such borrowings are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and are charged 30% to revenue and 70% to capital in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Nature and purpose of reserves Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve arose when Ordinary shares were cancelled, at which point an amount equal to the par value of the Ordinary share capital was transferred from the Statement of Comprehensive Income to the capital redemption reserve.
Capital reserve This reserve reflects any gains or losses on investments realised in the period along with any movement in the fair value of investments held that have been recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
These include gains and losses from foreign currency exchange differences.
Additionally, expenses, including finance costs, are charged to this reserve in accordance with c and f above.
Revenue reserve This reserve reflects all income and costs which are recognised in the revenue column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The revenue reserve represents the amount of the Companys reserves distributable by way of dividend.
h Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities and financial instruments carried at fair value are translated at the rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as a gain or loss to capital or revenue Murray International Trust PLC 57 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued within the Statement of Comprehensive Income depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.
i Derivative financial instruments Financial derivatives are measured at fair value based on an appropriate model.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the Statement of Financial Position date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period in the case of instruments that have floating rates.
There is no interest rate risk exposure from derivative instruments.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower based on current parameter used by the Managers Investment Risk Department on risk assessment and all other variables were held constant, the Companys: revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2016 would increase decrease by 39,000 2015 Murray International Trust PLC 67 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued increase decrease by 46,000.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash balances.
These figures have been calculated based on cash positions at each year end.
capital reserves would increase decrease by 7,560,000 2015 increase decrease by 761,000.
This is also mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to interest rates on cash balances and its fixed interest portfolio.
These figures have been calculated based on cash and fixed interest portfolio positions at each year end.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the interest rate risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
The risk parameters used will also fluctuate depending on the current market perception.
Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Statement of Financial Position can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Management of the risk It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
A proportion of the Companys borrowings, as detailed in note 14, was in foreign currency as at 31 December 2015.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to currency movements on borrowings by using forward foreign currency contracts as a hedge against potential foreign currency movements.
At 31 December 2016 the Company did not have any forward foreign currency contracts.
During the year a gain of 1,551,000 2015 loss of 746,000 was realised on forward currency contracts.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
The asset allocation between specific markets can vary from time to time based on the Managers opinion of the attractiveness of the individual markets.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table details the Companys sensitivity to a 10% decrease in the context of a 10% increase the figures below should all be read as negative in sterling against the major foreign currencies in which the Company has exposure based on exposure 5% of total exposure and excludes foreign exchange contracts due to the reason their being entered into is to mitigate foreign currency risk.
The sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.

Price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
The Companys stated objective is to achieve a total return greater than its benchmark by investing predominantly in equities worldwide.
Management of the risk It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 6, both act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges worldwide.
Price risk sensitivity If market prices at the Statement of Financial Position date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2016 would have increased decreased by 161,889,000 2015 increase decrease of 127,312,000 and capital reserves would have increased decreased by the same amount.
ii Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities as they fall due in line with the maturity profile analysed below.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities note 14. iii Credit risk This is failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk where the Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit ratings of the issuer are taken into account so as to manage the risk to the Company of default: investments in quoted bonds are made across a variety of industry sectors and geographic markets so as to avoid concentrations of credit risk: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the daily review of failed trade reports.
In addition, both stock and cash reconciliations to the custodians records are performed daily to ensure discrepancies are investigated in a timely manner.
The Managers Compliance department carries out periodic reviews of the custodians operations and reports its finding to the Managers Risk Management Committee: cash is held only with reputable banks with acceptable credit quality.
It is the Managers policy to trade only with Aand above Long Term rated and A-1 P-1 Short Term rated counterparties.
Credit risk exposure In summary, compared to the amounts in the Statement of Financial Position, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2016 was as follows: Murray International Trust PLC 71 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2016 2015 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum Sheet exposure Sheet exposure 000 000 000 000 Non-current assets Quoted preference shares and bonds at fair 267,866 267,866 165,719 165,719 value through profit or loss Current assets Current taxation 1,318 1,318 1,966 1,966 Deferred tax 891 891 Forwards 351 351 Other debtors 68 68 88 88 Accrued income 11,456 11,456 6,717 6,717 Cash and short term deposits 3,897 3,897 4,648 4,648 284,605 284,605 180,380 180,380 None of the Companys financial assets is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Forward currency contracts are measured at fair value.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated at 187,136,000 as at 31 December 2016 2015 195,754,000 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 185,150,000 2015 194,174,000 note 13.
The fair value of each loan is determined by aggregating the expected future cash flows for that loan discounted at a rate comprising the borrowers margin plus an average of market rates applicable to loans of a similar period of time and currency.
The carrying value of all other assets and liabilities is an approximation of fair value.
Fair value hierarchy FRS 102 requires an entity to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The Company has early adopted Amendments to FRS 102 Fair value hierarchy disclosures issued by the Financial Reporting Council in March 2016.
This has not resulted in any reclassifications in levelling and the prior year comparative has been disclosed under the new hierarchy.
The fair value hierarchy shall have the following classifications: Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value hierarchy at the reporting date as follows: 72 Annual Report 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31 December 2016 Note 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Quoted equities a 1,351,027 1,351,027 Quoted preference shares b 7,191 7,191 Quoted bonds b 260,675 260,675 Total 1,351,027 267,866 1,618,893 Net fair value 1,351,027 267,866 1,618,893 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31 December 2015 Note 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Quoted equities a 1,107,402 1,107,402 Quoted preference shares b 6,875 6,875 Quoted bonds b 158,844 158,844 Forward currency contracts c 351 351 Total 1,107,402 166,070 1,273,472 Net fair value 1,107,402 166,070 1,273,472 a Quoted equities The fair value of the Companys investments in quoted equities has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
Quoted equities included in Fair Value Level 1 are actively traded on recognised stock exchanges.
b Quoted preference shares and bonds The fair value of the Companys investments in quoted preference shares and bonds has been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
Investments categorised as Level 2 are not considered to trade in active markets.
c Forward currency contracts The fair value of the Companys investment in forward currency contracts has been determined in relation to models using observable market inputs and hence are categorised in Fair Value Level 2.
