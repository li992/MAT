The Group is in the early stages of assessing the potential impact of the new IFRS.

Segment information Operating segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Executive officer and the responsibilities of the Corporate Executive Team CET.
The completion of the Novartis transaction on 2 March 2015 changed the balance of the Group and GSK changed its segment reporting to reect this.
With effect from 1 January 2016, GSK has reported results under four segments: Pharmaceuticals, which now includes HIV, Pharmaceuticals R&D, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare and individual members of the CET are responsible for each segment.
Comparative information has been restated accordingly.
The Groups management reporting process allocates intra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.
The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment is the responsibility of the President, Pharmaceuticals R&D and is reported as a separate segment.
Corporate and other unallocated turnover and costs included the results of several Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare products which were held for sale in a number of markets in order to meet anti-trust approval requirements in 2014 and 2015, together with the costs of corporate functions.

Fair value remeasurements on contingent consideration recognised in business combinations comprised 2,162 million related to the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture and 152 million related to the contingent consideration, payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition, partially offset by hedging gains and other smaller items.
Fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments arise from foreign exchange forward contracts and options taken out to hedge against foreign currency movements when sales and purchases are denominated in foreign currencies see Note 42, Financial instruments and related disclosures.
In 2014 this included an unrealised loss of 299 million arising from a number of forward exchange contracts entered into following announcement of the proposed Novartis transaction to protect the Sterling value of the net US Dollar proceeds due to the Group on completion of the transaction.

Major restructuring costs Major restructuring costs charged in arriving at operating profit include restructuring costs arising under the Major Change programme initiated in 2013, under the Pharmaceuticals Restructuring Programme announced in October 2014 and following the Novartis transaction, completed in 2015.
Under the combined programme the total restructuring costs of 970 million in 2016 were incurred in the following areas: Restructuring of the R&D organisation, predominantly in the United Kingdom, North America and Japan.
Projects to simplify or eliminate processes leading to staff reductions in support functions.
Restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals business in Emerging Markets and Europe leading to staff reductions in sales force and administration.
Transformation of the Manufacturing and Vaccines businesses to deliver a step change in quality, cost and productivity.
The continued integration of the enhanced Vaccines business and the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture.
The analysis of the costs charged to operating profit under these programmes is as follows: 2016 2015 2014 m m m Increase in provision for major restructuring programmes see Note 29 163 718 267 Amount of provision reversed unused see Note 29 140 44 4 Impairment losses recognised 158 419 Other non-cash charges 108 51 15 Other cash costs 681 747 472 970 1,891 750 Provision reversals of 140 million 2015 44 million: 2014 4 million reect release of legacy support function and Novartis integration provisions.
Asset impairments of 158 million 2015 419 million: 2014 nil and other non-cash charges totalling 108 million 2015 51 million: 2014 15 million are non-cash items, principally xed asset write downs across support function, manufacturing and research facilities and accelerated depreciation where asset lives in R&D and manufacturing have been shortened as a result of the major restructuring programme.
All other charges have been or will be settled in cash and include the termination of leases, site closure costs, consultancy and project management fees.

In January 2017, GSK made further payments of 71 million in relation to UK corporation tax.
These amounts are for corporation tax only, and do not include the various other business taxes borne by GSK each year.
A significant component of the deferred tax credit for each of 2016 and the prior periods arose in respect of the remeasurement of the contingent consideration in relation to the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture.
In 2015, the credit also included the unwind of deferred tax liabilities on the disposal of the Groups Oncology business to Novartis.
The following table reconciles the tax charge calculated at the UK statutory rate on the Group profit before tax with the actual tax charge for the year.

The impact of differences in overseas taxation rates arose from profits being earned in countries with tax rates higher than the UK statutory rate, the most significant of which in 2016 were the US, France and India.
This was partly offset by the increased benefit of intellectual property incentives from the UK Patent Box and Belgian Patent Income Deduction regimes.
Such regimes provide a reduced rate of corporate income tax on profits earned from qualifying patents.
The Group also incurred material non-deductible charges following the revaluation of liabilities for the ViiV Healthcare and Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture put options.
The impact of higher overseas tax rates was reduced in 2015 by permanent differences arising on disposals.
The Groups overall effective tax rate for 2016 of 45.2% was inuenced by significant transaction-related remeasurement charges arising on the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability and the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture and ViiV Healthcare put option liabilities.
The remeasurement of these liabilities gave rise to a charge to profit before tax in 2016 of 3,862 million with a related tax credit of 396 million 10.3%.
Excluding these items, the effective tax rate for the year would have been 21.9%.
Further details on the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture put option are set out in Note 30, Other non-current liabilities and on the ViiV Healthcare arrangements on page 58.
Future tax charges, and therefore our effective tax rate, may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restructuring, the location of research and development activity, tax regime reforms and the resolution of open matters as we continue to bring our tax affairs up to date around the world.

Taxation continued Issues relating to taxation The Groups tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax expense.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be nally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
At 31 December 2016 the Group held provisions of 1,892 million in respect of such uncertain tax positions 2015 - 1,687 million.
The increase in recognised provisions during 2016 was primarily driven by the foreign exchange impact of revaluing overseas exposures.
While the ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with the relevant tax authorities, or litigation where appropriate, the Group continues to believe that it has made appropriate provision for periods which are open and not yet agreed by the tax authorities.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacturing at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets.
GSKs biggest risk with respect to taxation is that, despite our adherence to the OECDs established arms length principle, different tax authorities will seek to attribute further profit to activities being undertaken in their jurisdiction, potentially resulting in double taxation.
GSK applies a risk-based approach to determine the transactions most likely to be subject to challenge and the probability that the Group would be able to obtain compensatory adjustments under international tax treaties.
The Group also has open items in several jurisdictions concerning such matters as the deductibility of particular expenses and the tax treatment of certain business transactions.
The Group does not consider there to be any major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
There continues to be a significant international focus on tax reform, including the OECDs BEPS project and European Commission initiatives, including the increased use of scal state aid investigations.
Together with domestic initiatives around the world these may result in significant changes to established tax principles and an increase in tax authority disputes.
In turn, this could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.
The aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 18 billion 2015 16 billion.
The majority of these unremitted profits would not be subject to tax on repatriation as UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most overseas profits, subject to certain exceptions.
Provision for deferred tax liabilities of 205 million 2015 180 million has been made in respect of withholding tax that would arise on the distribution of profits by certain overseas subsidiaries.
The remainder of unremitted profits on which deferred tax has not been provided was 1.7 billion at 31 December 2016 2015 1.5 billion.
Deferred tax on distribution of these remaining profits has not been provided on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax liabilities provided in relation to intangible assets predominately relate to temporary differences arising on assets and liabilities acquired as part of historic business combinations.
The Group continues to recognise deferred tax assets on future obligations in respect of contingent consideration amounts payable to minority shareholders.
These payments are tax deductible at the point in time at which payment is made.
A deferred tax asset is recognised on intra-Group profits arising on inter-company stock which are eliminated within the consolidated accounts.
As intra-Group profits are not eliminated from the individual entities tax returns a temporary difference arises that will reverse at the point in time stock is sold externally.
The deferred tax asset recognised on tax losses comprises a 173 million 2015 97 million asset related to trading losses and a 54 million 2015 nil asset related to capital losses.
Other net temporary differences include accrued expenses for which a tax deduction is only available on a paid basis.
After offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities where appropriate within territories, the net deferred tax asset comprises: 2016 2015 m m Deferred tax assets 4,374 2,905 Deferred tax liabilities 1,934 1,522 2,440 1,383 180 GSK Annual Report 2016 Notes to the financial statements continued 14.

The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

Disposals and write-offs in the year include a number of assets with nil net book value that are no longer in use in the business.
182 GSK Annual Report 2016 Notes to the financial statements continued 17.
Property, plant and equipment continued The net book value at 31 December 2016 of the Groups land and buildings comprised freehold properties 3,887 million 2015 3,251 million, properties with leases of 50 years or more 294 million 2015 327 million and properties with leases of less than 50 years 42 million 2015 100 million.
Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2016 were leased assets with a cost of 590 million 2015 756 million, accumulated depreciation of 253 million 2015 233 million, impairment of 1 million 2015 nil and a net book value of 448 million 2015 523 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2016 were leased assets with a cost of 44 million 2015 31 million, accumulated depreciation of 15 million 2015 27 million, impairment of nil 2015 nil and a net book value of 29 million 2015 4 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arose from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
These calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specic risks.
For value in use calculations, where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash ow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash ows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 9%.
The net impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 45 million 2015 109 million, R&D 15 million 2015 63 million and SG&A 120 million 2015 174 million, and included 151 million 2015 327 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arose from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments were deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.
The carrying value at 31 December 2016 of assets for which impairments have been charged or reversed in the year was 171 million 2015 138 million.
During 2016, 139 million 2015 90 million of computer software was reclassied from assets in construction to intangible assets on becoming ready for use.

Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model.
Fair value less costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash ow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows and terminal value.
The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specic country or currency risks.
The valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Details relating to the discounted cash ow models used in the impairment tests of the Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs of disposal Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.
Terminal growth rates based on managements estimate of future long-term average growth rates.
Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate.
Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each region.
Period of specific projected cash flows Five years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate Pharmaceuticals 1% p. a.
7% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets, reect the impact of future generic competition and take account of new product launches.
In each case the valuations indicated sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Goodwill is monitored at the segmental level.
The Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 211 million 2015 240 million.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 9.03 billion 2015 7.71 billion.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
The increase in carrying value in the year primarily reects the impact of exchange rate movements.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment and other amortised intangible assets are tested when indicators of impairment arise.
This testing applies a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, generally using post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for country and currency specic risks.
This valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classied as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution, the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions and exchange rates.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil% and 5% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these intangible assets.

At 31 December 2016, the Group owned 32 million shares or 29.5% of Innoviva, which is a biopharmaceutical company listed on NASDAQ.
The company partnered with GSK in the development of the long acting beta agonist vilanterol and currently receives royalty income from sales of products that contain this component, namely Relvar Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta.
It also retains a 15% economic interest in future royalties to be paid by GSK on sales of Closed Triple, if approved and commercialised.
The remaining 85% of the economic interest in these royalties will be due to Theravance Biopharma Inc. a company spun out of Innoviva in 2014, in which the Group holds 18.6% of the common stock.
The investment in Innoviva had a market value of 278 million at 31 December 2016 2015 229 million.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by management with reference to relevant available information, including the current market value of similar instruments and discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
Other investments included listed investments of 580 million 2015 987 million.
The decrease in the carrying value during the year was primarily due to the sale of the Groups remaining stake in Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited which had a book value at 31 December 2015 of 383 million.
The most significant of the investments held at 31 December 2016 was in Theravance Biopharma, Inc. in which the Group holds 18.6% of the common stock.
This investment had a fair value at 31 December 2016 of 248 million 2015 93 million.
The other investments include equity stakes in companies with which GSK has research collaborations, which provide access to biotechnology developments of potential interest and interests in companies that arise from business divestments.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within Other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

As the amounts are estimated, they may not fully reect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.

Pensions and other post-employment benets continued GSK entities operate pension arrangements which cover the Groups material obligations to provide pensions to retired employees.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS S2 standard mortality tables to reect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI 2015 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per year for both males and females.
In the US, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2014 white collar table adjusted to reect recent experience.
These rates are projected using scale BB-2D to allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2036 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK US Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.8 29.8 27.2 28.9 Projected for 2036 29.6 31.9 28.9 30.6 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
In 2013, the target asset allocation of the US plans was also updated to 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
The Pension Plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the Plans assets might decline, the investment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the Plans liabilities might increase.
In line with the agreed mix of return seeking assets to generate future returns and liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations, the Group has dened an overall long-term investment strategy for the Plans, with investments across a broad range of assets.
The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term ination, equities, property, and bank counterparty risk.
The Plan liabilities are a series of future cash ows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19R basis, these cash ows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term ination rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve where an increase in long-term ination corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the US the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US.

In 2016, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identied at the 31 December 2014 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on the funding agreements following the 2014 valuation, the additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit are expected to be 123 million in 2017.
The contributions were based on a government bond yield curve approach to selecting the discount rate: the rate chosen included an allowance for expected investment returns which reected the asset mix of the schemes.
Employer contributions for 2017, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 362 million in respect of dened benefit pension schemes and 100 million in respect of post-retirement benets.

The goodwill in the businesses acquired represents the potential for further synergies arising from combining the acquired businesses with GSKs existing businesses together with the value of the workforce acquired.
The majority of the goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Total transaction costs recognised in 2014 and 2015 for the acquisitions from Novartis amounted to 102 million.
Between 2 March 2015 and 31 December 2015, turnover of 1,941 million arising from the Novartis Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines businesses was included in Group turnover.
If the businesses had been acquired at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that Group turnover in 2015 would have been approximately 320 million higher.
These businesses have been integrated into the Groups existing activities and it is not practical to identify the impact on the Group profit in the period.
Disposals Oncology GSK has divested its marketed Oncology business, related R&D activities and rights to its AKT inhibitor and also granted commercialisation partner rights for future oncology products to Novartis for consideration of $16 billion 10,395 million before purchase adjustments.

The Groups foreign exchange contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.
At 31 December 2016, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a net asset fair value of 34 million 133 million asset less 99 million liability.
At December 2015, the fair value was a 61 million net asset 115 million asset less 54 million liability.
The overall decrease in the net asset fair value has been due to the weakening of Sterling against all major currencies in 2016, in particular impacting the hedging of Euro and US Dollar denominated inter-company loan balances that are not designated as accounting hedges.
Fair value movements are taken to the Income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company loan balances.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value hedges At 31 December 2016, the Group had no designated fair value hedges.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its European Euro foreign operations as shown in the table above.
The hedges relating to the Japanese Yen foreign operations were closed out during the year.
The carrying value of bonds on page 215 includes 3,189 million 2015 2,740 million that are designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges.
Cash ow hedges During 2016, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which have been designated as cash ow hedges.
These are hedging the foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro and US Dollar denominated coupon payments relating to the Groups European and US medium term notes and a number of highly probable forecast transactions denominated in US Dollars.
In addition, the Group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging uctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued in prior years.
The balance is reclassied to finance costs over the life of these bonds.
e Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities The following tables set out the financial assets and financial liabilities which are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.
Amounts which are set off against financial assets and liabilities in the Groups balance sheet are set out below.
For Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables, Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities, amounts not offset in the balance sheet but which could be offset under certain circumstances are also set out.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued f Debt interest rate repricing table The following table sets out the exposure of the Group to interest rates on debt, including commercial paper.
The maturity analysis of xed rate debt is stated by contractual maturity and of oating rate debt by interest rate repricing dates.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings other than obligations under finance leases.
2016 2015 Total debt Total m m Floating and xed rate debt less than one year 4,106 1,285 Between one and two years 2,216 2,276 Between two and three years 1,277 1,868 Between three and four years 1,096 Between four and five years Between five and ten years 4,082 3,464 Greater than ten years 7,045 6,573 Total 18,726 16,562 Original issuance prole: Fixed rate interest 17,342 16,127 Floating rate interest 1,381 434 Total interest bearing 18,723 16,561 Non-interest bearing 3 1 18,726 16,562 g Sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations as at 31 December.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity Foreign currency exposures arise from the translation of financial assets and liabilities which are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts, inter-company loans and deposits, other receivables and payables and trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments hedging legal provisions and activities arising from acquisitions and disposals of assets.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to Sterling against movements in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen.
Based on the Groups net financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December, a weakening of Sterling against these currencies, with all other variables held constant, is illustrated in the table below.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to foreign exchange risk where this risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The equity impact, shown below, for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging the Groups net investments in its European Euro foreign operations and cash ow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro and US Dollar denominated coupon payments relating to the Groups European and US medium term notes and a number of highly probable forecast transactions denominated in US Dollars.

The table below presents the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates based on the composition of net debt as shown in Note 31 adjusting for the effects of foreign exchange derivatives that are not part of net debt but affect future foreign currency cash ows.

Interest rate sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates will affect future cash ows or the fair values of financial instruments.
The majority of debt is issued at xed interest rates and changes in the oating rates of interest do not signicantly affect the Groups net interest charge, although the majority of cash and liquid investments earn oating rates of interest.
The table below hypothetically shows the Groups sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US Dollar and Euro variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
If the interest rates applicable to oating rate financial assets and liabilities were to have increased by 1% 100 basis points, and assuming other variables had remained constant, it is estimated that the Groups finance income for 2016 would have increased by approximately 3 million 2015 37 million increase.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued h Contractual cash ows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The Group did not use interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.
Contractual cash ows in respect of operating lease vacant space provisions are excluded from the table below as they are included in the Commitments under non-cancellable operating leases table in Note 41, Commitments.

In addition, there was an increase of 2.9 billion in forecast future cash ows in respect of contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012 and for the acquisition of the Novartis Vaccines business in 2015.
Anticipated contractual cash ows for the repayment of debt and debt interest have increased by 2.3 billion over the year, principally due to the retranslation of US Dollar denominated debt which has been adversely impacted by the weakening of Sterling due to volatility in the markets compounded by political and economic events throughout 2016.
The table below provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows for the Groups derivative instruments, excluding embedded derivatives and equity options which are not material, using undiscounted cash ows.
The gross cash ows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purpose of this table although, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have increased compared with 31 December 2015 as a result of hedging of the US commercial paper programme and increased hedging of Euro receivables.

Employee share schemes GSK operates several employee share schemes, including the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period and the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.
The granting of these restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the schemes more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
The Group also operates savings related share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc at a discounted price.
Grants of restricted share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting or performance period.
Awards are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc but in some circumstances may be settled in cash.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Options under historical share option schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
The total charge for share-based incentive plans in 2016 was 338 million 2015 349 million: 2014 346 million.
Of this amount, 271 million 2015 307 million: 2014 302 million arose from the Share Value Plan.
See Note 9, Employee Costs for further details.
GlaxoSmithKline share award schemes Share Value Plan Under the Share Value Plan, share awards are granted to certain employees at no cost.
The awards vest after two and a half to three years and there are no performance criteria attached.
The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield of 4.5% 2015 5.7%: 2014 5.2% over the duration of the award.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a dened measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted from 2014 to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on three equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.
These are adjusted free cash ow, TSR and R&D new product performance.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees the performance conditions are based on both GSKs EPS growth compared with the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period and adjusted free cash ow.
In addition, some businesses have an element of their award based on a strategic or operational business measure, over a three year measurement period, specic to the employees business area.
The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant.
For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant.
During 2016, awards were made of 4.6 million shares at a weighted fair value of 11.01 and 1.2 million ADS at a weighted fair value of $31.78.
At 31 December 2016, there were outstanding awards over 13.2 million shares and 3.3 million ADS.
Share options and savings-related options For the purposes of valuing savings-related options to arrive at the share based payment charge, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2016 Grant 2015 Grant 2014 Grant Risk-free interest rate 0.32% 0.88% 0.7% Dividend yield 4.9% 6.5% 5.8% Volatility 23% 21% 19% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Savings-related options grant price including 20% discount 12.95 10.14 11.31 224 GSK Annual Report 2016 Notes to the financial statements continued 43.

All of the other share options and ADS options are currently exercisable and all will expire if not exercised on or before 22 July 2020.
There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts The Group sponsors Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts to acquire and hold shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc to satisfy awards made under employee incentive plans and options granted under employee share option schemes.
The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shares with finance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions.
In 2016, Treasury shares with a carrying value of 466 million were purchased by the UK ESOP Trust to satisfy future awards.
The costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement.
Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves and amortised down to the value of proceeds, if any, receivable from employees on exercise by a transfer to retained earnings.
