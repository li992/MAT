Valuations were based on current prices in an active market for all properties.
The property valuations were carried out by external, professionally qualified valuers as follows: London: Cushman and Wakefield: Knight Frank Rest of UK: Cushman and Wakefield Germany: Cushman and Wakefield France: Jones Lang LaSalle Sweden: L Fllstrm AB Property valuations are complex and require a degree of judgement and are based on data which is not publicly available.
Consistent with EPRA guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs into the valuations include equivalent yields and rental income and are described as unobservable as per IFRS 13.
These inputs are analysed by segment in the property portfolio information on the inside front cover.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst an increase in equivalent nominal yield would result in a fall in value and vice versa.
Investment properties included leasehold properties with a carrying amount of 48.1 million 2015: 38.7 million.
Interest capitalised within capital expenditure in the year amounted to 0.7 million 2015: 0.4 million.
Where the Group leases out its investment property under operating leases the duration is typically three years or more.
No contingent rents have been recognised in either the current or the comparative year.
Substantially all investment properties and the hotel detailed in note 14 are secured against debt.
In 2010 the Group purchased a property in London for 1.8 million.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, should the site be developed additional consideration may become due to the vendor.
The maximum liability in respect of this is estimated to be 0.5 million.
At the balance sheet date the fair value of the liability was nil 2015: nil.
