Carried Interest The incentive arrangements, which are similar to arrangements found elsewhere in the private equity industry, are designed to align Epiris interests with those of Electras shareholders.
These arrangements are typically referred to as carried interest.
The carried interest payable to the members of Epiris is based on three year pools of investments.
Under the terms of this arrangement all qualifying investments in a three year period are aggregated into a separate pool.
Electra must first receive back the aggregate cost of all the investments in the pool, plus related priority profit share see below and an 8% compound return this is often referred to as the hurdle.
Once Electra has received sufficient cash to pay the amounts as described above the members of Epiris will be entitled to a carried interest of 18% of the profits.
Consequently, they will receive the next 18 82 of the hurdle so that they will have an amount equal to 18% of the profits on the pool up to that point this is referred to as a catch up.
Thereafter, Electra and the members of Epiris will share future cash flows in the ratio of 82:18.
Below is an example to illustrate in principle how the above described arrangements work: m Assumptions Amount invested 500 Amount invested and priority profit share Amount realised 1,000 Realised after year five Pool profit 500 Hurdle 210 8% per annum compound Catch up 46 18 82 of the hurdle Balance 44 The amount over the hurdle to get to an aggregate 18% of the pool profit Total carry 90 18% Electra 410 82% At 31 May 2017, when the contract with Epiris terminates, any provision on post 2006 Pools, which is unpaid at that date and any future uplift to it will be reduced by 20% which will revert back to the Company.
