They include: preference shares: debentures: overdrafts and short and long-term loans from banks: and derivative contracts.
If the Company has cash assets, these may be assumed either to net off against borrowings, giving a net or effective gearing percentage, or to be used to buy investments, giving a gross or fully invested gearing figure.
Where cash assets exceed borrowings, the Company is described as having net cash.
