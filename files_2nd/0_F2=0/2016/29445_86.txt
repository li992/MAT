FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 30.
Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: and market risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Groups exposure to credit risk from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policies in place to prevent credit risk occurring.
Most revenues arise from insured patients business and the NHS.
Insured revenues give rise to trade receivables which are mainly due from large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness.
The remainder of revenues arise from individual Self-pay patients and consultants.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also a collective loss component established in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified, determined based on historical data of payment statistics.
Note 19 shows the ageing and customer profiles of trade receivables outstanding at the year end.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in short-term money market deposits with large financial institutions, which must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rating agencies.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Liquidity is managed across the Group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for regulatory purposes.
Short-term operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand and overdraft facilities.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of at least 90 days, including the servicing of financial obligations.
In addition to cash on demand, the Group has available the following lines of credit: 100.0 million of revolving credit facility, which was fully undrawn as at 31 December 2016 2015: 100.0 million.

Financial risk management continued The following are the contractual maturities, as at the balance sheet date, of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements: At 31 December 2016 Carrying Contractual 1 year More than million amount cash flows or less 12 years 2 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Secured bank facility 424.1 456.0 10.9 11.3 433.8 Obligations under finance leases 76.1 270.4 8.5 8.5 253.4 Trade and other payables 55.9 55.9 55.9 As at 31 December 2016 556.1 782.3 75.3 19.8 687.2 At 31 December 2015 Carrying Contractual 1 year More than million amount cash flows or less 12 years 2 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Secured bank facility 423.1 479.3 12.1 14.0 453.2 Obligations under finance leases 75.3 278.7 8.3 8.5 261.9 Trade and other payables 50.5 50.5 50.5 As at 31 December 2015 548.9 808.5 70.9 22.5 715.1 Bases of valuation The management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The carrying value of the other financial instruments, being finance leases and debt, is approximately equal to their fair value based on a review of current terms against market and expected short-term settlements, except for floating rate debt, which is after the deduction of 2.9 million 2015: 4.0 million of issue costs.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group did not hold any financial instruments measured at fair value 2015: nil.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates.
This affects future cash flows from money market investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings.
From time-to-time, the Group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium-term derivative financial instruments.
Interest rates on variable rate loans are determined by LIBOR fixings on a quarterly basis.
Interest is settled on all loans in line with agreements and is settled at least annually.
