Operations Mines in steady-state or in ramp-up phase.
Capcoal comprises opencast operations at Lake Lindsay and Oak Park, with an underground longwall operation at Grasstree.
1 Estimated Ore Reserves are the sum of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves on an exclusive basis, i. e. Mineral Resources are reported as additional to Ore Reserves unless otherwise stated.
Please refer to the detailed Ore Reserve estimates tables in the AA plc R&R Report for the individual Proved and Probable Reserve estimates.
The Ore Reserve estimates are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2012 as a minimum standard.
Ore Reserve estimates for operations in South Africa are reported in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves.
Anglo American plc ownership is stated separately.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
2 Reserve Life The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan.
LOM Life of Mine years is based on scheduled Probable Reserves including some Inferred Resources considered for Life of Mine planning.
3 DBCi fide Beers Canada, DBCM fide Beers Consolidated Mines, Debswana Debswana Diamond Company, Namdeb Namdeb Holdings.
Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes cpht or as carats per square metre cpm.
Reported Diamond Reserves are based on a Bottom Cut-off BCO which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 1.00mm and 3.00mm nominal square mesh.
Specific BCOs applied to derive estimates are included in the detailed Diamond Reserve tables in the AA plc R&R Report.
Snap Lake has been placed on Care & Maintenance.
Damtshaa will resume production in H2 2017.
No Diamond Reserves reported for Letlhakane Kimberlite as mining is now scheduled exclusively from Inferred Resources hence one year LOM.
4 Estimates reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo American Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Details of the individual operations appear in the Anglo American Platinum Limited Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report.
4E is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold.
6 Saleable Product tonnes are reported on a wet basis average moisture content is 9.0 wt% of the wet mass with quality stated on a dry basis.
7 GEMCO Manganese grades are reported as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields, see page 29 in the AA plc R&RReport.
8 Total Saleable Tonnes represents the product tonnes produced quoted as metric tonnes on a Product moisture basis.
The coal quality for Coal Reserves is quoted as either kilocalories per kilogram kcal kg or Crucible Swell Number CSN.
Kilocalories per kilogram represent Calorific Value CV on a Gross AsReceived GAR basis.
CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg and CSN to the nearest 0.5 index.
Metallurgical Coking: High-, mediumor low-volatile semi-soft, soft or hard coking coal primarily for blending and use in the steel industry.
Metallurgical Other: Semi-soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection PCI or other general metallurgical coal for the export or domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal.
Thermal Export: Lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation: quality measured by calorific value CV.
Thermal Domestic: Lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation.
Synfuel: Coal specifically for the domestic production of synthetic fuel and chemicals.
Peace River Coal Trend and Roman Mountain Mines has been placed on Care & Maintenance.
