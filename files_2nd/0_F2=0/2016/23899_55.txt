The effective tax rate is higher than the UKs headline tax rate due to the geographic mix of countries in which Fidessa operates.
Several of these countries have headline tax rates that are greater than that in the UK, the two resulting in the greatest variance for Fidessa being the US and Japan.
Fidessa continues to recognise certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty, including those related to transfer pricing, when the tax treatment cannot finally be determined until accepted by the relevant tax authority.
Adjustments relating to prior years arise from the resolution of specific uncertainties and the remaining risks are appropriately reflected in the recognised provisions and accruals.
The primary influences on Fidessas effective tax rate are changes in headline tax rates and tax disallowances or incentives in the countries operated in.
This is reflected by the correlation between Fidessas effective tax rate and the UK headline tax rate over the last five years.
From 2010 through 2016 Fidessas effective tax rate has reduced from 30.1% to 26.8% and in the same time the UK headline tax rate has fallen from 28.0% to 20.0%.
These are expected to continue to be the primary influences on the effective tax rate into the future.
The Group has adopted the research and development expenditure credit regime RDEC.
As a result, research and development tax credits previously reported within the income tax expense are replaced by above the line research and development grants.
The grants are shown as deferred income as they are earned and are subsequently credited to income as a reduction in operating expenses over the period that the related development costs are amortised.
A corresponding other receivable is recognised at the time the grant is earned and will subsequently be offset against tax payable.
The new treatment has been adopted with effect from 1st January 2015 and in the year ended 31st December 2016, grants totalling 1,650,000 of which 1,357,000 relates to 2015 have been credited to income as a reduction to operating expenses note 6.
The adoption of RDEC is also reflected in the income tax expense for 31st December 2016 and the majority of the 2.3% movement in the effective tax rate for the year ended 31st December 2016 when compared to the previous year reflects the tax impact of adopting RDEC for 2015 and 2016.
The UK government has reduced the UK corporation tax rate to 19% with effect from 1st April 2017 and to 17% with effect from 1st April 2020.
