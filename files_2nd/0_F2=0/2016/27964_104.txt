Share-based payments The Company issues share options to certain employees, including Directors.
Equity-settled share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
In valuing equity-settled share options, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share option is expensed over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled share options at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of a market condition, be treated as vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market vesting condition or a non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the condition is satisfied, provided that all other non-market vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of the modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where shares of the Company have been provided as consideration in business combinations, the fair value of the shares is determined using appropriate valuation methods applicable to the transaction.
