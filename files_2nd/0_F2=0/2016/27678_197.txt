Consideration of shareholder views In developing the revised New Policy and the MSIP, we consulted with our largest shareholders and also shared a substantial amount of information about the proposals with major shareholder representative bodies in the UK such as ISS and the Investment Association.
The feedback received during the consultation period was reflected in the New Policy and the design of the MSIP.
