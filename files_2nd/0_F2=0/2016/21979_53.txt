Notes to the consolidated financial statements 85 9.
Taxation continued Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to BTs pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.
Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax will change from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017 and to 18% on 1 April 2020.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2016 have been calculated at the rate of which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit specific item in the income statement note 8 and as a deferred tax expense in reserves.
The UK Finance Bill 2016 includes a reduction of the UK corporation tax rate to 17% on 1 April 2020.
This will replace the 18% UK corporation tax rate that is currently legislated to take effect.
This will have an effect on future tax charges of the group.
Relevant deferred tax balances will be re-measured to 17% once the UK Finance Bill 2016 is substantively enacted.
Unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences At 31 March 2016 the group had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 4.1bn 2014 15: 3.8bn.
The groups other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 31 March 2016 m Expiry Restricted losses Europe 13 20172023 Americas 105 20202034 Other 38 20172021 Total restricted losses 156 Unrestricted operating losses 3,742 No expiry Other temporary differences 155 No expiry Total 4,053 At 31 March 2016 the group also had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 17.0bn 2014 15 17.1bn.
These losses have no expiry date, and the group considers the future utilisation of these losses to be remote.
At 31 March 2016 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were 3.3bn 2014 15 8.1bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise.
Tax of 23.1m 2014 15: 21.2m would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.
Dividends A dividend of 1,450m 2014 15: 1,200m, was settled on 13 May 2015 in relation to the year ended 31 March 2015.
This is disclosed in the group statement of changes in equity.
The directors have declared a final dividend of 2,350m, which will be recognised as an appropriation of retained earnings in 2016 17.
As the dividend was declared after 31 March 2016, no liability is recorded in these financial statements.
