Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Britvic plc the company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
It is a public limited company domiciled in England & Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Britvic plc and its subsidiaries together the group operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, France and Brazil.
The financial year represents 53 weeks ended 2 October 2016 prior financial year 52 weeks ended 27 September 2015.
For the UK, Ireland and International the results are for the 53 weeks ended 2 October 2016 prior financial year 52 weeks ended 27 September 2015.
For France and Brazil the results are for the calendar year ended 30 September 2016 prior calendar year ended 30 September 2015.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 29 November 2016.
Statement of compliance The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS, as they apply to the financial statements of the group.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below.
The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional currency of the company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern The directors are confident that it is appropriate for the going concern basis to be adopted in preparing the financial statements.
As at 2 October 2016, the consolidated balance sheet is showing a net assets position of 281.0m 27 September 2015: net assets of 211.8m.
Group reserves are low due to the capital restructuring undertaken at the time of flotation.
This does not impact on Britvic plcs ability to make dividend payments.
The liquidity of the group remains strong, the group has a 400.0m bank facility with a recently extended maturity date of November 2021, and 659.8m of private placement notes which have maturity dates between 2016 and 2026.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the group incorporate the financial information of the company and the entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.
Control is achieved when the company: Has the power over the investee: Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date the group gains control or up to the date control ceases respectively.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when payment is being made.
Revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and accepted by customers, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.

Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition continued Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, after the deduction of sales related discounts and rebates, value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Sales related discounts comprise: Long term discounts and rebates which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and are related to total volumes purchased and sales growth Short term promotional discounts which are directly related to promotions run by customers Where sales related rebates and discounts are earned, management make an accrual where it is probable that the rebate will be earned by the customer.
Accruals are made for each individual promotion or rebate based on the specific terms and conditions of the customer agreement.
Management make estimates on an ongoing basis to assess customer performance and sales volume to calculate total amounts earned to be recorded as deductions from revenue.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Assets under construction are carried at cost.
Depreciation of these assets commences when they are ready for use.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows: Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years Vehicles included in plant and machinery 5 to 7 years Equipment in retail outlets included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 to 10 years Other fixtures and fittings included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 10 years Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and are included in the consolidated income statement in the period of derecognition.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives and residual amounts are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Non-current assets held for sale The group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than continuing use.
Such non-current assets as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately beneath current items in the statement of financial position.
Business combinations and goodwill While the original acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited was accounted for under the merger method, business combinations on or after 4 October 2004 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value which includes recording deferred consideration at discounted values where the impact of discounting is material.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired discount on acquisition is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Software costs Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Costs include resources focussed on delivery of capital projects where the choice has been made to use internal resources rather than external resources.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis.
Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

indd 102 13 12 2016 19:11 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over a period appropriate to the assets useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also tested for impairment annually either individually or, if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Research and development Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset when the group can demonstrate: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use Its intention to complete and its ability to use the asset How the asset will generate future economic benefits The availability of resources to complete the asset The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development The ability to use the intangible asset generated Following initial recognition of development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and available for use.
It is amortised over the period of expected future benefit.
During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For all remaining intangible assets the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Where impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount or the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit CGU to which the asset belongs if it does not generate largely independent cash flows.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects senior managements estimate of the cost of capital.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Goodwill impairment losses cannot subsequently be reversed.
Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial assets The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables The group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.

indd 103 13 12 2016 19:11 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Fair value The group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability: or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstance and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated income statement.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: Cash flow hedges Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs.
However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
Net investment hedges Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the groups net investment in foreign operations.
Some of the groups foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances.
The effective portion of gains or losses on translation of borrowings designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign operations any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through the consolidated income statement.
Fair value hedges Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying amount would be amortised to the consolidated income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate.
The fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the consolidated income statement.

indd 104 13 12 2016 19:11 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Derecognition of financial instruments The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, or when the contractual rights to the cash flows have either been transferred or an obligation has been assumed to pass them through to a third party and the group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are only derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below.
The consolidated income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Taxation The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, intangible assets, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, provisions for share-based payments and unutilised losses incurred in overseas jurisdictions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised a finance cost.
Pensions and post retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension schemes.
These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans The defined benefit pension liability or asset in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets excluding interest, is reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
Past service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period of a plan amendment.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: Service cost including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements : Net interest expense or income: and Remeasurement.

Accounting policies continued Pensions and post retirement benefits continued The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the groups defined benefit plans.
Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the period are charged to the consolidated income statement as an operating expense.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses and paid annual leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the group.
Leases Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the group.
Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Any lease incentives received are credited to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, on demand deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance cost.
On a refinancing any unamortised financing charges are accelerated through the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling.
The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is the same as the functional currency of the company.
For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items, included in the financial statements of each entity, are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement, except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences in monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in consolidated income statement.
Foreign operations The consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period.
The balance sheet is translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on opening net assets and arising on the translation of results at an average rate compared to a closing rate are both recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement.
Certain of the groups financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the groups net investment in foreign operations.
See derivative financial instruments and hedging policy above for further detail.
Issued share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.

indd 106 13 12 2016 19:11 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Accounting policies continued Exceptional and other items The group presents items as exceptional and other items on the face of the consolidated income statement to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
Exceptional items include those items of income and expense which, because of the size, nature or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
Other items include fair value movements on financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied on future transactions and also where hedge ineffectiveness is recognised.
These items have been included within exceptional and other items because they are non-cash and do not form part of how management assesses performance.
Key judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements and estimates which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Post-retirement benefits The determination of the pension and other post-retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
These key assumptions are disclosed in note 22.
Franchise rights Franchise rights represent franchise agreements acquired as part of the Britvic Ireland business combination which provides long term rights to distribute certain soft drinks.
These agreements were allocated a 35 year useful economic life at the time of acquisition based on a third party assessment.
As at 2 October 2016 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 26 years.
The franchise agreement itself has a remaining contract life of 9 years which is less than the useful economic life.
The useful economic life has been determined on the basis that the renewal of the franchise agreements, without significant cost, is highly probable.
Evidence to support this conclusion is: Significant emphasis on maintaining a strong relationship with Pepsi, strengthened through the addition of Pepsico products to Britvics portfolio in recent years: Lack of alternative suppliers: and High barriers of entry to the Irish soft drinks bottling market.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives Management have made a judgement that certain intangible assets relating to brands have indefinite lives.
It is expected that the trademarks with indefinite lives will be held and supported for an indefinite period of time and are expected to generate economic benefits.
The group is committed to supporting its trademarks and invests in significant consumer marketing promotional spend.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill intangible asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Further details are given in note 15.
New standards adopted in the current period During the period, the group did not adopt any new standards.

Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors of the company.
For management purposes, the group is organised into business units and has six reportable segments as follows: GB stills United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland GB carbs United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland Ireland Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland France Brazil International These business units sell soft drinks into their respective markets.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on brand contribution.
This is defined as revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product.
Such costs include brand specific advertising and promotion costs, raw materials and marginal production and distribution costs.
However, group financing including finance costs and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments.

Other material reducing items include tax on current period share scheme exercises, credit for loss on the prior period FX forwards hedging the Brazil acquisition and incremental tax recoverable as a result of the acquisition of Brazil.
d Uncertain tax positions Uncertainties in relation to tax liabilities have been provided for in the tax payable account to the extent that it is considered probable that the group will be required to settle a tax liability in the future.
Settlement of tax provisions could potentially result in future cash tax payments however these are not expected to result in an increased tax charge as they have been fully provided for in accordance with managements best estimates of the most likely outcomes.
e Unrecognised tax items The group expects that future remittances of earnings from its overseas subsidiaries will be covered by the UK dividend exemption and so no tax is recognised on the un-remitted earnings of these subsidiaries.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to losses made in the preceding period.
These are expected to be recoverable on an ongoing basis due to a reduction in interest charges leading to higher profits in subsequent periods.
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely, but the amount of carry forwards losses that can be utilised in certain territories is limited to 30% of taxable income in each carry forward year.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 8.3m 2015: 8.8m.
Previously unrecognised losses arising on India have been eliminated as a result of the closure of the business.
There are no other unrecognised temporary differences associated with investments.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit loss for the period attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Impairment testing of intangible assets continued Method of impairment testing continued Discount rates reflect senior managements estimate of the pre-tax cost of capital adjusted where necessary to reflect the different risks of different countries in which the group operates.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
The group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing.
The same discount rate is relevant to all CGUs in each country as the group only operates in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution market sector.
The applicable pre-tax discount rate for cash flow projections is: 2015 2016 Britvic GB 10.9% 9.4% Britvic Ireland 9.3% 8.4% Britvic France 12.8% 10.9% Britvic Brazil - 17.9% Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill.
Volume growth rates reflect senior management expectations of volume growth based on growth achieved to date, current strategy and expected market trends and will vary according to each CGU.
Marginal contribution being revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product.
Marginal contribution is based on financial budgets approved by the Britvic plc board.
Key assumptions are made within these budgets about pricing, discounts and costs based on historical data, current strategy and expected market trends.
Advertising and promotional spend financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to advertising and promotional spend.
This is based on the planned spend for year one and strategic intent thereafter.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead inflation the basis used to determine the value assigned to inflation is the forecast increase in consumer price indices in the relevant market.
This has been used in all value in use calculations performed.
Cash flows are based on the latest approved budgets and forecasts in most cases this is periods beyond one year.
The applicable long term growth rates are: 2016 2015 Britvic GB 2.0% 2.1% Britvic Ireland 2.5% 2.7% Britvic France 2.0% 1.6% Britvic Brazil - 2.9% Intangible assets with finite lives No indicators of impairment were identified on intangible assets with finite lives and no impairment was recognised against these assets.
Results and conclusions No impairments have been identified during the 53 week period ended 2 October 2016.
In 2015 no impairments were identified.
Other than for the Britvic trademark within Britvic Ireland where the recoverable amount is equal to its carrying value, the directors do not consider that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the value in use of remaining goodwill and intangible assets would result in any impairment.
The key assumption to which the calculation of value in use for the Britvic trademark within Britvic Ireland is most sensitive is the discount rate where an increase in the discount rate from 8.4% to 9.4% would result in an impairment charge of 1.1m.

The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 1 August 2002 and closed to future accrual for active members from 1 April 2011, with active members moving to the defined contribution section for future service benefits.
The BPP is a limited partner of Britvic Scottish Limited Partnership Britvic SLP, which in turn is a limited partner in both Britvic Property Partnership Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP.
Britvic SLP, Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP are all consolidated by the group.
The investment held by BPP does not represent a plan asset for accounting purposes and is therefore not included in the fair value of the plan assets.
Certain properties and group brands have been transferred to Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP respectively, all of which are leased back to Britvic Soft Drinks Limited.
The group retains operational flexibility over the properties and brands including the ability to substitute the properties and brands held by Britvic PP and Britvic Brands respectively.
The BPP is entitled to a share of the profits in Britvic SLP until 2026.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the BPP will be changed to an amount equal to any funding deficit of the BPP at this time, up to a maximum of 105m.

Pensions continued GB Schemes continued Contributions are paid into the defined benefit section of the BPP as determined by the Trustee, agreed by the company and certified by an independent actuary in the Schedule of Contributions.
In addition to the expected partnership income of at least 5m per annum, the group will make payments to the BPP of 15m per annum by 31 December each year, in 2016 and 2017.
Additional contributions of 15m per annum by 31 December in the years 2018 and 2019 will be made should the formal actuarial valuation in 2016 reveal that these contributions are necessary to return the BPP to full funding on a self-sufficiency basis by 31 March 2020.
During this year 20.0m of additional contributions were paid to the BPP, of which 15.0m was paid by the group and 5.0m relates to income received from the pension funding partnership PFP structure.
The triennial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2016 is currently underway and is expected to be complete by 31 March 2017.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the consolidated income statement for 2016 was 12.0m 2015: 11.4m.
Britvics business in GB also has a secured unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit scheme called The Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme BETUS which provides benefits for members who have historically exceeded the Earnings Cap, or the Lifetime Allowance whilst members of the defined benefit section of the BPP.
BETUS closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011 which coincided with the closure of the defined benefit section of the BPP.
Republic of Ireland scheme The Britvic Ireland Pension Plan BIPP is a defined benefit pension plan.
Following legislative changes made in 2012 no deficit recovery contributions are currently required.
The 1 January 2015 triennial valuation has now been completed.
The Trustee has been undertaking investment fide-risking to protect the on-going funding position achieved as a result of the 2012 changes.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the consolidated income statement for 2016 was 0.7m 2015: 0.6m.
Northern Ireland scheme The Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan BNIPP is a defined benefit pension plan which was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General.
The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2014.
France schemes Britvic France operates two defined benefit schemes: in the first, employees receive long-service cash payments at various stages throughout their careers.
From the second, employees receive a lump sum at retirement.
Payment amounts are dependent upon salary and service with the company.
The schemes are unfunded therefore these benefits are paid directly as they fall due.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the groups finances, except for the Britvic France schemes which are operated directly by the company.

Pensions continued Demographic assumptions The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
This is based on standard actuarial tables, which for the BPP are known as SAPS Series 1.
An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included.
The following life expectancy assumptions have been used: 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 GB ROI NI GB ROI NI Years Years Years Years Years Years Current pensioners at age 65 males 21.4 20.9 22.2 21.5 21.0 22.3 Current pensioners at age 65 females 24.5 23.5 25.6 24.4 23.4 25.0 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 males 23.2 23.3 24.0 23.2 23.4 24.4 Future pensioners currently aged 45 at age 65 females 26.4 25.6 27.6 26.3 25.5 26.6 The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2014 following a mortality analysis carried out as part of the actuarial valuation of the BPP at 31 March 2013.
Sensitivities Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.
Assumption Change in Impact on GB Impact on ROI Impact on NI Impact on France assumption liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 81.6m Decrease by 9.6m Decrease by 3.6m Decrease by 0.3m Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 95.4m Increase by 11.1m Increase by 4.3m Increase by 0.3m Inflation rate Increase by 0.25% Increase by 30.6m Increase by 2.5m Increase by 4.2m Increase by 0.2m Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by 22.8m Decrease by 2.4m Decrease by 3.8m Decrease by 0.1m Longevity rates Increase by 1 year Increase by 27.3m Increase by 1.6m Increase by 4.1m n a The sensitivity to inflation assumption includes corresponding changes to future salary applicable only to France and future pension increase assumptions.

Pensions continued Categories of scheme assets continued The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets whereas the fair values of properties are not based on quoted market prices.
The fixed interest and index linked asset classes include leveraged gilt funds.
Normal contributions of 0.8m are expected to be paid into the defined benefit pension schemes during the 2017 financial year.
Additional contributions of 21.5m are expected to be paid into the defined benefit pension schemes during the 2017 financial year, of which 16.5m is expected to be paid by the group and 5.0m by the partnership.
Risks For defined contribution sections and plans, the groups liability is limited to the requirement to pay contributions on behalf of each employee.
In these arrangements the associated risks are borne by the members.
For defined benefit sections and plans, the group bears the risks of operation.
The main risk that the group runs in respect of the defined benefit schemes is that additional contributions are required to pay for the benefits if investment returns are not sufficient.
The contributions required for the schemes are in general determined at each triennial actuarial funding valuation.
The key factors that will affect the need for additional contributions include levels of long-term inflation and interest rates and the assessment of how long members are expected to live, along with the level of investment return achieved.
The level of investment return achieved is subject to a range of risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular market risk on equities, credit risk on corporate bonds and exposure to the property market.
The discount rates used to calculate the liabilities are set by reference to yields on high quality corporate bonds.
There is therefore a mismatch between the assets held and the way that the liabilities are calculated, meaning that the net balance sheet position disclosed under IAS 19 could fluctuate.
For the BPP, the trustee holds the power to determine the contribution rates that the group should pay, although the group fully uses the opportunity to make representation to the trustee on this point.
The trustee of the BPP agreed to implement an investment strategy which consists of a diverse range of fixed interest and index-linked securities, which will provides a significant hedge against inflation and interest rate risk.
The intention is to continue to remove equities from the investment portfolio to further reduce investment risk.
The funding partnership mitigates the risk that additional cash contributions will be required after 31 March 2026, as the partnership will pay up to 105m to remove any funding deficit at 31 March 2026.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Overview The groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, and cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under the groups employee incentive schemes.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the groups operations include trade receivables and payables see notes 17 and 23 respectively.
It is, and has always been, the groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk.
The board of directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Interest rate risk The groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The group enters into interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 2 October 2016 after taking into account the effect of these instruments, approximately 55% of the groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest 2015: 77%.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings and equity through the change in fair values of applicable derivative instruments.

The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the translation risk of net investments in foreign operations.
Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
In addition during the current period the group has entered into forward currency contracts to fix the sterling amount payable on the deferred consideration due on the purchase of a subsidiary in Brazil.
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials, capital expenditure and interest costs in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities.
Non-functional currency purchases and interest costs are mainly in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
As at 2 October 2016 the group has hedged 74% 2015: 62% of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash flows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar, euro and Brazilian real exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the groups equity due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties.
It is the groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups experience of bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 17.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial instruments.
This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained by either Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch.
The level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy.
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the groups banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being polyethylene terephthalate PET, sugar, steel and frozen concentrated orange juice.
The group does not enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity price risk however in the normal course of business where it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to protect against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Share schemes equity price risk The group operates several employee incentive share schemes.
It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan.
To hedge this risk the group has entered into equity derivatives against future scheme maturities.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Britvic plc share price, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of the equity derivatives.
Increase Effect on decrease in profit share price before tax % m 2016 10 0.7 10 0.7 2015 10 1.0 10 1.0 Liquidity risk The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts consider the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable and other financial assets and projected cash flows from operations.
The objective of the groups liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts and long term private placement issuance.
The groups bank facility has a maturity of November 2021 and is unsecured.
As at 2 October 2016, the group had drawn down 113.5m 2015: nil under this facility.
In addition to this facility the group had 1.6m of outstanding external borrowings all of which were secured 2015: 0.5m all of which were secured.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Hierarchy The group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis used to calculate fair value is level 2.
All derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments.
Forward currency contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Cross currency interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on quoted forward exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Equity derivatives are measured using share prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The fair value of derivatives also includes the non-performance risk of both Britvic and its derivatives trading counterparties.
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values, except for fixed rate borrowings.
The fair value of the groups fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and loans at 2 October 2016 was 690.3m 2015: 596.8m compared to a carrying value of 661.3m 2015: 575.1m.
The fair value of the groups fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using discounted cash flow methods using discount rates that reflect the groups borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period.
Capital management The group defines capital as being net debt plus equity.
The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The following table summarises the capital of the group: 2015 2016 m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 239.6 205.9 Derivatives hedging balance sheet debt 71.8 157.5 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities held at amortised cost 779.8 575.3 Adjusted net debt 416.4 263.9 Equity 281.0 211.8 Capital 697.4 475.7 The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or in order to facilitate acquisitions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.
In this way, the group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio.
Adjusted net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing loans and borrowings and the element of the fair value of interest rate currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the US private placement notes.
Adjusted net debt is shown in note 28.
The adjusted net debt EBITDA ratio enables the group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term.
The group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.

The group has equity forwards against schemes that mature in 2016 and 2017.
Forward currency contracts Ebba As part of cash management for expected future payments in relation to the deferred consideration of the purchase of Ebba BR$150.0m of BR$ sterling FX forwards were in existence at 2 October 2016 2015: BR$50.0m in relation to operational requirements.
Derivatives designated as part of hedge relationships As at the 2 October 2016 these hedging relationships are categorised as follows: Cash flow hedges Forward currency contracts The forward currency contracts hedge the expected future purchases in the period to March 2018 and have been assessed as part of effective cash flow hedge relationships as at 2 October 2016.
Forward currency contracts Ebba As part of the transaction to purchase Ebba on 30 September 2015, the group purchased forward currency contracts to hedge the FX movement on the purchase of the company in Brazilian Real.
Cross currency interest rate swaps USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps The group has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the 2007, 2010 and 2014 USPP Notes.
These cross currency interest rate swaps have the effect of fixing both the value of the USD borrowings into sterling and the rate of interest payable.
The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge relationship with the Notes.
Cash flows due under these cross currency interest rate swaps match the interest payment dates and maturity profile of the USPP Notes.
The maturity profile of the USPP Notes can be seen in note 21.
During the year the cash flow hedge has been tested for effectiveness and as a result a 0.4m gain 2015: 2.1m gain has been recognised in the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.

These instruments swap the principal and interest from fixed rate US dollar into floating rate sterling the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps.
The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a fair value hedge relationship with the Notes.
The fair value movements on the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate instruments are recorded in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Notes where the hedge is deemed effective.
The increase in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps, excluding maturities, of 29.7m 2015: 11.9m increase has been recognised in finance costs and offset with a similar loss on the borrowings of 30.2m 2015: 12.5m loss.
The net loss of 0.5m 2015: 0.6m loss represents the ineffective portion on the hedges of the debt.

Derivatives and hedge relationships continued Net investment hedges 2009 and 2010 GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps These instruments swap sterling liabilities arising from the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps into euro liabilities and have been designated as part of effective hedges of the net investments in Britvic France and Britvic Ireland.
The GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps, along with the underlying loan instruments, are being used to hedge the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these euro investments.
Movements in the fair value of the GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps are taken to equity where they offset foreign exchange movements on the translation of the net investments in Britvic France and Britvic Ireland.

Share-based payments Britvic operates a broad base of employee plans as well as executive plans.
In GB Britvic operates SIP plans for all employees, whereas outside of GB Britvic operates both share-settled and cash-settled plans.
Executives participate in ESOP and PSP plans and senior leadership team participates in PSP plans.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 53 weeks ended 2 October 2016, including national insurance is 6.6m 2015: 10.6m.
This expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee HMRC approved share plan open to employees based in GB.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award, where granted by the group, provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
Employees cant sell these shares for three years from their date of award.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Employees also have the opportunity to invest up to 138 every 4 weeks 1,800 per year through the partnership share scheme.
This is deducted from their gross salary.
Matching shares are offered on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 50 2015: 50 per four week pay period.

The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
Options granted in 2016 and 2015 The performance condition requires the increase in EPS of 6% - 12% pa compound over a three year performance period for the options to vest.
If the EPS growth is 6%, 20% of the options will vest, with full vesting at 12% EPS growth.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if the EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 110.7p 2015: 101.3p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees with vesting subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, where different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards up to and including 2008, and 2013 and later were made in respect of ordinary shares.
Awards granted between 2009 and 2011 were nil cost options.
Nil cost options remain exercisable until 7 or 10 years after the date of grant for employees based in Ireland and UK respectively, whereas awards of ordinary shares are exercised when vested.

Share-based payments continued The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP continued Awards granted in 2016 Two awards were granted in 2016.
The first award is split between the senior leadership team and the senior management team.
The performance condition applied to awards granted to members of the senior leadership team is divided 75% and 25% between EPS and the total shareholder return TSR performance conditions respectively.
EPS is the only condition applied to awards granted to senior management team.
The EPS condition is the same as described in the ESOP section for options granted in 2015.
The TSR condition measures the companys TSR relative to a comparator group consisting of 18 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 20% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
The second award is an exceptional award under the Performance Share Plan and has been awarded to selected employees.
The performance condition applied to awards granted is continued employment for three years from date of grant.
Awards granted in 2015 Awards granted in 2015 were as per the first award in 2016 outlined above.

Acquisition of subsidiary On 30 September 2015, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Empresa Brasileira fide Bebidas e Alimentos SA Ebba, a leading soft drinks company in Brazil.
The acquisition is in line with the strategic direction of the group, specifically to pursue international expansion by capitalising on global opportunities in the kids, family and adult categories, where Britvic has the leading brands in its core markets.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below.
m Property, plant and equipment 19.2 Intangible assets 38.6 Other non-current assets 0.1 Deferred tax assets 5.3 Inventory 12.4 Trade and other current receivables 12.2 Current tax assets 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 1.4 Total assets 89.5 Trade and other current payables 8.8 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 36.7 Provisions 4.3 Other non-current liabilities 1.0 Total liabilities 50.8 Total identifiable net assets 38.7 Goodwill 21.0 Total consideration 59.7 Satisfied by: Cash 42.6 Deferred consideration discounted 19.1 Tax receivable 2.0 Total consideration 59.7 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 42.6 Less: cash and cash equivalent balances acquired 1.4 Total consideration transferred 41.2 146 Britvic plc Annual Report 2016 177534 BRITVIC TEXT-p089-158.

Acquisition of subsidiary continued The consideration for the acquisition comprises an initial cash consideration of 32.4m BR$193.8m and the cost of foreign exchange forwards taken out to hedge the purchase of the company of 10.2m less 2.0m tax receivable in relation to the foreign exchange forwards.
The deferred consideration of 25.4m BR$152.2m is due on 30 September 2017 and is included in the consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities at its current discounted value of 31.2m.
In addition there was a repayment of Ebba debt of 32.1m BR$192.5m subsequent to acquisition.
Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the assembled workforce and the market presence which Ebba has in the Brazilian market that Britvic can use to exploit the potential of its global brands.
Trade and other current receivables with a fair value of 12.2m have been recognised on acquisition.
The gross contractual amounts on these receivables are 12.8m with 0.6m not expected to be collected.
From the date of acquisition to 2 October 2016, the acquired business contributed 89.5m to revenue and 17.5m to brand contribution for the period.
Due to the timing of the acquisition on 30 September 2015, the revenue and contribution for the period is materially the same as if Ebba had been completed on the first day of the financial period.
Foreign exchange gains of 8.7m on goodwill have been recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income in the period to 2 October 2016.
Integration related costs of 5.2m have been incurred in the current period.
Acquisition related costs of 6.5m were incurred in the prior period.
These have been included within exceptional and other items see note 5.
All amounts are at the :BR$ rate prevailing at the acquisition date of 30 September 2015 with the exception of the current value of the deferred consideration.
Post balance sheet event Subsequent to the period end, the group announced the acquisition, subject to competition approval, of East Coast Suppliers Limited, a licensed wholesaler in Ireland.
The acquisition price is deemed not material to the group.
