100 Notes to the Group Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2016 1.
Reporting entity Genus plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
Its registered office is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4DZ.
The Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
We have used the equity method to account for theGroups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Genus at a Glance on pages 2 and 3 explains the Groups operations and principalactivities.
Basis of preparation We have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements.
The going concern statement has been included in the Directors Report on page 86 and forms part of these statements.
In the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, we have separated the disclosure of certain pension related items comparative amounts to conform to the current years presentation and to increase clarity.
In the Group Statement of Cash Flows we have included the cash acquired on acquisition within investing activities in the comparative period.
In note 5 we have reclassified certain assets in the comparative period, in note 6 we have reallocated porcine semen sales from Sale of animals, semen, embryos and associated products and services to Royalties animal and semen to conform to the current years presentation and to increase clarity, in note 9 we have restated comparative amounts to incorporate casual employees to conform with the current period definition, in note 16 we have with separated out construction in progress comparative amounts and in note 24 operating profit sensitivity has been restated to be consistent with current year assumptions.
Functional and presentation currency We present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Use of estimates Preparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our application ofaccounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
Wereview our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting estimates in the periodin which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.
Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in applying accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts we recognised in the financial statements.
Non-GAAP measures adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share Adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share exclude the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, exceptional items and other gains and losses.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide shareholders with useful information about the Groups trading performance.
The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group Income Statement.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole This section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the Financial Statement, the policy has been described in that note.
We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.
Accounting convention We prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets and derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with IFRS, we measure: biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling expenses: share-based payment expense: pension liabilities: and certain financial instruments at fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities the Group controls.
We have control when we have the power to govern the entitys financial and operating policies, so benefitting from its activities.
In assessing control, we take into account potential voting rights that we can currently exercise or convert.
We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date that control transfers to the Group.
We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries we cease to control from the date that control passes.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee.
We eliminate unrealised losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only tothe extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole continued Foreign currencies We record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entitys functional currency, at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the exchange rate at the transaction date.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign currency, we translate them at the prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
We translate these operations revenues and expenses using an average rate for the period.
When exchange differences arise from translating foreign operations into Sterling, or from the fair value movement of related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve.
When we dispose of a foreign operation, we release these differences to the income statement.
Exchange movements on inter-Company loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal components of the Groups revenue and their respective accounting treatments are: Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products, which we recognise when risks and rewards transfer to the customer or distributor.
This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, depending on the terms of sale.
We recognise royalties when receivable.
We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based on key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of the animals born.
This amount is confirmed directly to Genus by the customer.
Revenue from consulting and other services, which represent the amounts we charged for services we provided during the year, including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax.
We recognise services provided but not yet billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive payment.
Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event occurs.
Revenue from the slaughter of porcine animals is recognised when the risks and rewards transfer to the slaughterhouse.
Research and development We undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure in the income statement as we incur it.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities.
When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are commercially viable, our policy is to capitalise further development costs within intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38.
Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine pre-stud herds.
We do not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair value of the Groups biological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.
We disclose the costs of research and herd development activities, as required by IAS 38.
New standards and interpretations No new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current period.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 102 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 3.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole continued New standards and interpretations not yet adopted At the date of authorisation of these Group Financial Statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in preparing these Group Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations, IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements, IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative, IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception: Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 2014 Cycle: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: and IFRS 16 Leases.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new pronouncements on its results, financial position and cash flows.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3 or in the specific note the policy relates to, the Directors arerequired to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Determination of the fair value of biological assets note 15 Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires significant judgement and assumptions.
Bovine: The key judgements are in respect of the forecast sales volumes, the expected unit prices, the animals useful lifespan and the discount rate we apply.
Porcine: The key judgements and assumptions are in respect of the animals useful lifespan, the proportion that go to slaughter, the mixof boars and gilts and, in the case of the animals in the pure line herds, the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices achieved on sales, the animals expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate we apply.
Defined benefit pension schemes note 27 Amounts recorded in the Financial Statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on significant estimates.
Judgements required included the extent to which we should provide for any amounts that might become payable under our joint and several liability in respect of the Milk Pension Fund, and the extent of additional liability required under IFRIC 14.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets note 14 Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires us to consider any specific impairment indicators and to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units to which we have allocated goodwill, intangible and tangible assets.
Thevalue in use calculation requires us to estimate the future cash flows arising from the cash-generating unit and the appropriate discount rate, in order to calculate present value.
Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
For management purposes, the Groups operating and reporting structure comprises four operating segments: Genus PIC, Genus ABS, Genus Asia and Research & Development.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its segmental information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows: Genus PIC our global porcine sales business excluding Asia Genus ABS our global bovine sales business excluding Asia Genus Asia our porcine and bovine business in Asia Research and Development our global spend on research and development Genus plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 103 5.
Segmental information continued A segment analysis of revenue, operating profit, depreciation, amortisation and non-current asset additions and segment assets and liabilities are detailed below.
We do not include our adjusting items in the segments as we believe these do not reflect the underlying progress of the segments.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies as described in the Financial Statements.

Note 7 provides details of these exceptional items.
We consider share-based payment expenses on a Group-wide basis and do not allocate them to reportable segments.
Geographical information The analysis of revenue by geographical area is stated on the basis of where the legal entity is incorporated and therefore in the country the revenue will be reported.
The Groups revenue by geographical segment is analysed below: Revenue 2016 2015 m m North America 178.7 181.2 Latin America 58.6 59.0 Europe, Middle East and Africa 105.9 116.9 Asia 45.1 41.4 388.3 398.5 Non-current assets excluding deferred taxation and financial instruments 2016 2015 m m North America 347.5 306.3 Latin America 56.3 51.2 Europe, Middle East and Africa 98.2 85.0 Asia 16.3 14.0 518.3 456.5 6.

Exceptional items The Group presents items as exceptional when the Directors believe them to be exceptional because of their size or incidence.
The tax impact of the exceptional items is disclosed in note 11.
2016 2015 m m Operating income expense : Pension related 44.2 0.4 Litigation 6.9 2.8 Acquisition and integration 0.2 1.4 Other including restructuring 0.8 1.3 36.3 5.1 Pension related During the year, a gain of 43.9m arose as a result of changing the index used for pensions and deferred pension increases in the Milk Pension Fund from RPI to CPI, and a 0.3m settlement gain arose from members leaving the same scheme.
Litigation Litigation includes legal fees of 5.4m 2015: 2.8m related to the action by ABS Global, Inc. ABS against Inguran, LLC aka Sexing Technologies ST and 1.5m US$2m for up-front damages related to patent infringement and confidential information.
On 14 July 2014, ABS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, launched a legal action against ST, in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging, among other matters, that ST: i has a monopoly in the processing of sexed bovine semen in the US: and ii unlawfully maintains this monopoly through anticompetitive contractual provisions and the repeated acquisition of exclusive patent rights related to semen processing.
The legal action aimed to remove these barriers and allow free and fair competition in the sexed bovine semen processing market ABS Action.
On the same date, ABS also filed an Inter-Partes Review application IPR challenging the validity of one of STs group patents, US Patent No.
7,195,920 the 920 patent before the US Patent Office.
Subsequently, ABS also filed IPRs challenging the validity of STs group patents US Patent No.
8,206,987 the 987 patent and US Patent No.
ST and its subsidiary XY Inc. filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the ABS Action, denying any anticompetitive activities, and alleging, among other matters that: i ABS fraudulently induced ST to enter into the parties semen sorting agreement: ii that the Company and ABS repudiated and breached the agreement: and iii that the Company and ABS have infringed the 920, 425, 987 and 092 patents.
On 29 April 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB ruled that ABS had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its assertion that relevant claims of the 987 patent were invalid and declined to order the institution of a trial.
On 11 January and 15 April 2016, the PTAB ruled that the 920 and 425 patents were unpatentable.
ST has appealed these decisions.
The parties await adecision of the PTAB on whether a hearing will be instituted on the validity of the 092 patent.
On 21 July 2016, the Court issued its Summary Judgment decision which, among other things, confirmed that STs fraudulent inducement claim failed as a matter of law.
On 1 August 2016, the litigation commenced in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.
On 10 August 2016, the jury determined that the Company and ABS had proved that ST had wilfully maintained monopoly power in the market for sexed bovine semen processing in the US since July 2012, but had not proved that they had suffered injury to date as a result.
On 11 August 2016, the jury also determined that i STs 987 and 092 patents were valid and infringed and ii that ABS had materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties.
On 12 August 2016, the jury determined that i the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front payment of US$750,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$1.25 per straw on commercialisation of the Genus Sexed Semen technology for the use of STs 987 patent: ii the Company and ABS should pay ST anup-front payment of US$500,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$0.50 per straw for the use of STs 092 patent: and iii ABS had materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties and damages weredetermined to be US$750,000.
In response to the verdicts reached the Company and ABS has sought an injunction from the Court to allow, among other things, ABS to terminate the 2012 semen sorting agreement and to provide relief from the restrictive provisions under that agreement.
The parties have also commenced the Court briefing on post-trial motions.
The Company and ABS has sought, among other things, judgment as a matter of law that the 987 patent is invalid and that the 092 patent is not infringed, or alternatively a new trial on the patent claims.
The Group plans to commercialise its sexed semen technology in the US and globally and introduce competition into the market.
Acquisitions and integration During the year, 0.2m of expenses were incurred in relation to acquisition and integration, principally 0.1m in relation to In Vitro Brasil S. A. and 0.1m for St Jacobs Animal Breeding Corp. See note 36.
Other including restructuring Included within other is a 1.4m provision for prior year receivables from Venezuelan customers due to government restrictions onforeign exchange and a 0.8m provision for restructuring the European ABS business, partially offset by income of 1.4m from anhistorical insurance reclaim.

Included within Genus ABS are 163 average monthly full-time equivalent employees who joined through the IVB acquisition which was completed in the prior year.
Net finance costs Net finance costs mainly arise from interest due on bank loans, pension scheme liabilities and the results of hedging transactions used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
Accounting policy We recognise interest income and interest payable in the income statement as they accrue.

Taxation and deferred taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets and liabilities held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.
Accounting policies Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
We recognise tax in the income statement, unless: it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity: or it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 108 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 11.
Taxation and deferred taxation continued Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit.
We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet liability method.
We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent that we will probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against.
We do not recognise these assets and liabilities if the temporary difference arises from: our initial recognition of goodwill: or our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination that affects neither our taxable profit nor our accounting profit.
We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures and associates, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset.
We charge or credit deferred tax in the income statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

Tax is calculated using prevailing tax legislation, reliefs, and existing interpretations and practice.
However tax laws may change in the future as countries reform their tax legislation to implement the OECDs BEPS recommendations and such future changes could impact the Groups futuretax charge and effective tax rate.
The tax credit attributable to exceptional items is 5.4m 2015: charge of 1.6m.

Taxation and deferred taxation continued Income tax recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Changes in Equity 2016 2015 m m Income tax recognised directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income Financial instruments 0.1 Foreign exchange differences on long-term intra-Group currency loans 0.1 0.3 Actuarial movement on retirement benefit obligations 4.5 1.6 Translation of biological assets, intangible assets and finance leases 17.0 6.4 12.3 5.1 Income tax recognised directly to the Statement of Changes in Equity Share-based payment expense 0.1 0.8 Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses which were available for offset against future profits, with a potential tax benefit of 15.2m 2015: 11.9m.
We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of 2.5m 2015: 1.5m of these benefits as we expect these losses to be offset against future profits of the relevant jurisdictions in the near term.
We have not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the remaining 12.7m 2015: 10.4m, due to uncertainty about the availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.
At 30 June 2016, the expiry dates of deferred tax assets in respect of losses available for the carry forward are as follows: Expiring within 110 years 1120 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 0.3 2.2 2.5 Losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised 12.7 12.7 0.3 14.9 15.2 At 30 June 2015, the expiry dates of deferred tax assets in respect of losses available for the carry forward are as follows: Expiring within 110 years 1120 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 0.3 1.2 1.5 Losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised 0.1 10.3 10.4 0.1 0.3 11.5 11.9 We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling 4.5m 2015: 3.9m for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries.
This is because we can control the timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities We have offset deferred tax assets and liabilities above, to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances: 2016 2015 m m Deferred tax assets 4.7 7.8 Deferred tax liabilities 118.5 105.2 113.8 97.4 UK deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated at 18%.
The Government intends to enact a further reduction in the main tax rate down to 17% effective from 1 April 2020.
As this tax rate was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the relevant rate reduction is not yet reflected in these Financial Statements, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
We estimate that the future rate change to 17% would reduce our UK net deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 2016 from 4.2m to 4.0m.

Genus plc Annual Report 2016 112 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 14.
Intangible assets Our Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill, acquired technology, customer relationships and our Genus Sexed Semen GSS development project.
We recognise that accounting for intangible assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed tothe asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill When we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost CGUs, excluding transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether thoserights are separable.
We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
We allocate goodwill to cash-generating units, which are the smallest identifiable Group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets orGroups of assets.
We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment.
IAS 21 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, rather than of the acquiring entity: goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation: and any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquirees assets and liabilities.
We therefore express them in the foreign operations functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair values.
Their cost is their fair value at the acquisition date.
After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows: Software 2 to 10 years Porcine and bovine genetics technology 20 years Multiplier contracts 15 years Customer relationships 10 to 17 years Patents and licences term of agreement Intangible assets acquired separately We carry intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.
We charge amortisation on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and review the useful life and amortisation method at the end of each financial year, accounting for the effect of any changes in estimate on a prospective basis.
Impairment We review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any indication exists, we estimate the assets recoverable amount.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, we discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.8% 2015: 10.8%, which is derived from theGroups weighted average cost of capital.
For some countries we add a premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country.
If the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the CGU that theasset belongs to.
We recognise an impairment loss in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverableamount.
When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to CGUs, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the units other assets on a pro rata basis.
Reversals of impairment We reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and we have changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.
We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it would have had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss.

Included above is 17.8m of capitalised development expenses in respect of GSS, and in addition there is also 7.7m included within fixed assets relating to GSS.
During the year, we acquired a worldwide licence to use Caribou Biosciences, Inc. s leading CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology platform.
Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our operating segments.
These are the lowest level within the Group at which we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Genus PIC 56.7 49.2 Genus ABS 21.9 17.2 Genus Asia 7.4 7.5 86.0 73.9 We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
We determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations relate to discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices, direct costs and the cost saving derived from the GSS project.
We have estimated the pre-tax discount rate using the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
We risk adjusted the discount rate for risks specific to each market, adding between nil and 16% to the WACC as appropriate.
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% 2015: 8.0% we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10.8% 2015: 10.8%.
Our estimates of changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 114 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 14.
Intangible assets continued The annual impairment test is performed immediately before year end and is based on cash flows derived from our most recent financial and strategic plans approved by management and extrapolate cash flows beyond this period using estimated growth rates.
Short-term profitability and growth rates are based on past experience, current trading conditions and our expectations of future changes in the market.
We have applied annual growth rates to cash flows in the five-year financial and strategic planning period.
A growth rate of 2.5% 2015:2.5% has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period.
Genus PIC and Genus ABS CGUs are deemed to be significant.
The individual country assumptions used to determine value in use for these CGUs are: Risk adjusted discount rate Short-term growth rates CAGR Long-term growth rates 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Genus PIC 823% 1126% 612% 114% 2.5% 2.5% Genus ABS 819% 1126% 115% 319% 2.5% 2.5% The rates towards the higher end of the range above represent those which are applied to our smaller entities and those in emerging markets and hence appear high relative to others.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Sensitivity analysis has been performed on all of the key assumptions noted above and we believe that no reasonable potential change in any of them would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Biological assets The Group applies quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding.
We use these techniques to identify and select animals with the genes responsible for superior milk and meat, high health and performance traits.
We sell breeding animals and semen to customers, who use them to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality, for the global dairy andmeat supply chain.
We recognise that accounting for biological assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements andkey sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Biological assets and inventories In bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the Holstein dairy breed.
Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and progeny testing of its daughters performance.
We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers demand.
Farmers use semen from dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock.
They use the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.
We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets.
We transfer bull semen to inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2.
We state our inventories at the lower ofthis deemed cost and net realisable value.
Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process.
As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed semen production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the production process.
We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock the nucleus herd, to provide genetically superior animals.
These genetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-quality products, which yield higher value.
So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority of our pig production to our global multiplier network.
We also sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers for use in commercial farming.
Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: upfront and royalty.
Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the animal at the point we transfer it to the customer.
Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately identifiable components: its carcass and its genetic potential.
We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately the animals carcass value, at the point we transfer the pig to the customer.
We retain our interest in the pigs genetic potential and receive royalties for the customers use of this genetic potential.
The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty contracts, are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
We recognise changes in fair value in the income statement, within operating profit for the period.
We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals, as non-current assets and carry them at fair value.
The porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified ascurrent assets.
We split our retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales between current and non-current assets, based on theremaining expected life of the animals.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 115 15.
Biological assets continued Determination of fair values biological assets IAS 41 Agriculture requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet.
We determine this carrying value according to IAS 41s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the income statement.
There are important differences in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.
Bovine we base the fair value of proven bulls, bulls with a genomic evaluation and bulls on test, on the net cash flows we expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate.
Proven bulls are those we have evaluated through daughter proofs and whose semen we actively market.
Genomic bulls are those we market on their estimated genetic value.
We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory we manage where a third party has a share in semen sales from a particular bull.
The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated production value, each bulls expected marketable life and, for bulls on test, the percentage whose production we expect to actively market.
In assessing the sales price, we use independent statistical data for the bulls.
This data is produced three times a year in allourmajor markets.
In addition, we estimate which markets we will sell the semen in, as well as domestic and export prices.
Bulls that have not yet entered our testing programme have a fair value equivalent to their acquisition and rearing costs.
Porcine the fair value of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the genetics of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements.
The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the animals average live weights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable.
We base the live weight value and the genetic premium on recent transaction prices we have achieved.
The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding animals expected life, the percentage of production animals that are saleable as breeding animals, and the expected sales prices.
For our retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales of similar animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element.
We then remeasure the fair value of our retained interest at each reporting date.
The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the animals expected life.
We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account.
We do this using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds future outputs at current prices.
The significant assumptions we make are the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we achieve on sales, the animals expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate.
Non-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group To manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers multipliers who produce piglets on farms we neither manage nor control.
We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium.
Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.
We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the balance sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to hold them for the purpose of receiving non-financial items the offspring, in accordance with our expected purchase requirements.
This means the option is outside the scope of IAS 39.
We do not recognise the offspring as biological assets under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.

Biological assets continued Bovine biological assets include 7.8m 2015: 6.0m representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as assets held under finance leases.
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during the year.
The current market-determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen is the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets.
Inventories of such semen are shown as biological asset harvest in note 19.
Included in increases due to purchases is the aggregate increase arising during the period on initial recognition of biological assets in respect of multiplier purchases, other than parent gilts, of 49.4m 2015: 43.3m.
Decreases attributable to sales during the period of 152.0m 2015: 166.3m include 49.6m 2015: 37.0m in respect of the reduction in fair value of the retained interest in the genetics of animals, other than parent gilts, transferred under royalty contracts.
Porcine biological assets include 69.3m 2015: 65.2m relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the genetics in respect of animals, other than parent gilts, to customers under royalty contracts.
Total revenue in the period, including parent gilts, includes 127.2m 2015: 114.5m in respect of these contracts, comprising 38.1m 2015: 37.4m on initial transfer of animals to customers and 89.1m 2015: 77.1m in respect of royalties received.
For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the expected output of the herds are discounted at the Groups required rate of return, adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations.
This adjusted rate has been assessed as 11.0% 2015: 11.0%.
The number of future generations which have been taken into account is seven 2015: seven and their estimated useful lifespan is 1.3 years 2015: 1.3 years.

Property, plant and equipment We make significant investments in our property, plant and equipment.
All assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Accounting policies We state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, we account for them separately.
We charge depreciation to the income statement on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part of an asset.
Theestimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 10 to 40 years Leasehold buildings over the term of the lease Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years We do not depreciate land and assets not available for use.

Equity accounted investees We hold interests in several joint ventures and associates where we have significant influence.
Accounting policies Joint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement.
The Group Financial Statements include the Groups share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The Group Financial Statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases.
When our share of losses exceeds our interest in an associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop recognising further losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on an associates behalf.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures or associates are initially recognised in the Group Balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognised the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint ventures and associates.
Related party transactions with the Groups joint ventures and associates primarily comprise product and services.
As each arrangement is a separate legal entity and control rights are substantially equal with the other parties, there are no significant judgements required to be made.

Cash and cash equivalents We hold cash and bank deposits which have a maturity of three months or less, to enable us to meet our short-term .
Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of our cashmanagement and are included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings less than one year.

Trade and other payables Our trade and other payables mainly consist of amounts we owe to our suppliers that have been invoiced or are accrued.
They also include taxes and social security amounts due in relation to our role as an employer.

The carrying values of these liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Provisions A provision is a liability recorded in the balance sheet, where uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore estimated.
The main provisions we hold are in relation to legal and restructuring matters.
Accounting policies We recognise a provision in the balance sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic benefits.
If the effect is material, we discount provisions to their present value.

The timing and cash flows associated with the restructuring costs and a majority of legal claims are expected to be less than one year.
However, for some legal claims the timing of cash flows may be long-term in nature.
The property provision mainly represents the discounted future costs of properties net of expected rental income not occupied by the Group or sublet.
The timing of the cash flow associated with property is dependent upon the remaining term of the associated lease.

Financial instruments This note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange rate risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage theserisks.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates our access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Groups operations, through internal risk reports that analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments.
Our use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
The Board of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk The principal financial risks our activities expose us to are risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of supplies in foreigncurrencies: interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.
Accounting policies Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets.
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Put option arrangements over non-controlling interest The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial liabilities when such options may only be settled by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of shares in the subsidiary.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within borrowings with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling interest, adjacent to non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable: the charge arising is recorded as a financing cost.
In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 124 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 24.
Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument in equity, in the hedging reserve.
Werecognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the Group Income Statement.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, we recycle in the Group Income Statement the associated gains and losses that we had recognised in equity.
We do this in the same period or periods that the asset or liability affects the Group Income Statement, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, orwe have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and werecognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If we no longer expect the hedged transaction to takeplace, we immediately recognise in the Group Income Statement the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
Net investment hedges Where we have designated a derivative financial instrument as hedging the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary, whicharises from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the subsidiarys functional currency, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as a going concern, while maximising the return to shareholders by optimising our debt and equity balance.
The Groups capital structure consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 25, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 29.
Gearing ratio The Group keeps its capital structure under review.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The gearing ratio at the year end was as follows: 2016 2015 m m Debt see note 25 123.7 93.1 Cash and cash equivalents see note 21 34.0 21.3 Net debt see note 30 89.7 71.8 Equity 368.1 305.1 Net debt to equity ratio 24% 24% Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 25.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Parent.
Categorises of financial instruments We have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 13.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
We have estimated the fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 13.
We have not categorised any financial instruments as Level 1 or Level 3.

The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against these currencies.
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents our assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
It includes external loans, as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the loan is denominated in a currency other than the lender or borrowers currency.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit when Sterling weakens against the relevant currency.
A strengthening of Sterling against the relevant currency would produce an equal but opposite reduction in profit, and the balances below would be negative.
Theimpact on other equity is minimal, due to the net investment hedging in place.

We manage this risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using interest rate swaps.
We regularly review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal hedgingstrategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section ofthis note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis We have determined the sensitivity analyses below, based on the Groups exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and nonderivative instruments, at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and is our assessment of a significant change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 June 2016 would decrease or increase by 0.5m 2015: decrease increase by 0.5m.
This impact is smaller than would otherwise be the case, due to the effects of fixed rate hedging.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts, calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the variable rate debt we hold.
We determine the fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date by discounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
This fair value is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Outstanding receive floating pay fixed contracts % % m m m m USD interest rate swaps Within one year 0.68 0.61 15.0 25.4 0.3 0.1 Two to five years 1.10 0.68 82.3 12.7 0.4 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 month LIBOR.
Wesettle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in profit or loss, over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.
Commodity hedges The Group hedges both feed and slaughter exposures by using the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME lean hog, corn, soybean meal and winter wheat commodity futures.

We have a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
We regularly monitor our exposure and the credit ratings of our counterparties, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that the Board reviews and approves annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
We carry out ongoing credit evaluation of the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk rests with the Board of Directors.
We manage this risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles offinancial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade payables and other creditors.
We have drawn up the table based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, using the earliest date onwhich we can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

After this initial recognition, we state them at amortised cost and recognise any difference between the cost and redemption value in the income statement over the borrowings expected life, on an effective interest rate basis.

As part of its interest rate strategy, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge floating LIBOR rates.
As a result, bankloan and overdrafts include borrowings of US$110m 82.3m fixed at 1.10%, excluding applicable bank margin.
Also included in the above is an unsecured agricultural development loan in the US of 0.1m 2015: 0.1m, which is interest free.
Finance lease liabilities A finance lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future in relation primarily to plant and machinery and motor vehicles.
Accounting policies We classify leases as finance leases whenever the lease terms transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to us.
Allother leases are operating leases.
We recognise the assets we hold under finance leases at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each of which we determine at the start of the lease.
We include our corresponding liability in the balance sheet, as a finance lease obligation.
We apportion lease payments between finance charges and a reduction in our lease obligation, so we achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining liability.
We recognise finance charges directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable toqualifying assets, in which case we capitalise them in accordance with our general policy on borrowing costs.
Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: Minimum lease Minimum lease payments Interest Principal payments Interest Principal 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 m m m m m m Less than one year 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 Between one and five years 2.7 0.2 2.9 2.4 0.2 2.6 3.8 0.2 4.0 3.5 0.2 3.7 Finance lease liabilities are secured over the assets to which they relate.

The fair value of the leases is approximately equal to the carrying amount.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 130 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 27.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are the Milk Pension Fund and Dalgety Pension Fund in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and are administered by trustees and managed professionally.
We recognise that accounting for retirement benefit obligations is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty.
Accounting policies Defined contribution pension schemes A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
We charge contributions to the income statement as they become payable under the scheme rules.
We show differences between the contributions payable and the amount we have paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The schemes assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees.
These schemes are closed to new members and to further accrual.
We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, in return for their service to date.
We discount that benefit to determine its present value, and deduct the fair value of the plans assets at bid price.
The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities.
Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected unitmethod.
We recognise actuarial gains and losses in equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets, and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities.
The retirement benefit obligations include those relating to the Milk Pension Fund defined benefit scheme.
Genus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the schemes obligations.
We account for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will have to pay under our joint and several liability.
The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for the schemes obligations that we have not accountedfor.
Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the income statement.
After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses in the orphan assets and liabilities are recognised directly into equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.
Retirement benefit obligations The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, are aggregated for disclosure purposes.
The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.
2016 2015 m m The Milk Pension Fund Genuss share 34.3 54.3 The Dalgety Pension Fund Other retirement benefit obligations and other unfunded schemes 10.2 8.8 Overall net pension liability 44.5 63.1 Overall, we expect to pay 7.1m 2016: 6.7m in contributions to defined benefit plans in the 2017 financial year.
The defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards that are legally separated from the Group.
The trustee board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.
The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and the governance of the fund.
The defined benefit pension schemes exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the plans.
The UK pensions environment is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives are set out in legislation and include promoting and improving understanding of the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits and regulating occupational defined benefit and contribution schemes.
The Pensions Regulator is a non-departmental public body established under the Pensions Act 2004 and sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory framework set by the UK Parliament.
The Pensions Regulators statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website at thepensionsregulator.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 131 27.
Retirement benefit obligations continued All defined benefit schemes are UK registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and are subject to UK legislation and oversight from The Pensions Regulator.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years.
Separate valuations are required for each scheme.
Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.
Funding plans are individually agreed for each Groups defined benefits pension scheme with the respective trustees, taking into account local regulatory requirements.
The publication by the International Accounting Standards Board in June 2015 of its Exposure Draft of amendments to IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, has provided additional clarity on the role of trustees rights in an assessment of the recoverability of a surplus in an employee pension fund.
The trustees of the defined benefits schemes have neither a unilateral right to wind up the plan and purchase annuities nor a unilateral right to improve members benefits and consequently the Exposure Draft as currently proposed is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups results.
The Milk Pension Fund MPF The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd the principal employer, now known as Community Foods Group Limited, National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd which went into receivership in June 2009 and Milk Link Ltd. We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together represent approximately 75% of the MPF 2015: 75%.
Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a last man standing scheme, which means that all participating employers are jointly and severally liable for all of the funds liabilities.
With effect from 30 June 2013, Genuss remaining active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.
On 11 January 2016, The trustees of the MPF agreed with a request from the employers to change the index used for pension and deferred pension increases from RPI to CPI.
The members of the scheme were informed of this change on 17 February which is effective for increases starting in 2016.
As a result of the change, Genus recorded a gain of 43.9m.
The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2015 and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The valuation has been agreed by the trustees and is currently being reviewed by The Pensions Regulator before final sign off.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that: investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed interest gilt yields by 1.1% per annum: CPI price inflation is expected to be 0.9% per annum lower than RPI price inflation: and pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum and maximum increases.
At 31 March 2015, the market value of the funds assets was 403m.
This represented approximately 87% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were 465m at 31 March 2015.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2015 valuation, was 62m of which Genuss notional share was 47m.
This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers.
Under the trustee prepared schedule of contributions, Genus will be required to make deficit repair contributions of 5.6m per annum commencing 31 March 2016, and rising thereafter by 3.4% per annum until 31 August 2022, in addition to funding operating expenses of the scheme.
Genus has assessed its additional pension liability under IFRIC 14 by reference to this schedule of contributions, resulting in an amount of 14.9m 2015: nil being recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Dalgety Pension Fund DPF The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2015 and carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 4.1% per annum before retirement and 2.2% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 3.3% perannum.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2015 was 31.6m.
The value of those assets represents approximately 101% of the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were 31.3m at 31 March 2015.
Under the funding agreement, the Company will not have tomake deficit repair contributions.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations carried out as at31 March 2015 and updated to 30 June 2016.
There is a 15.5m reserve held by the trustees of DPF against future unknown liabilities materialising.
As the economic benefit to Genus of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
In addition to the aggregate asset and liabilities disclosed, a bulk annuity policy was secured with an insurance company in July 1999, which matched the benefit entitlement of the almost all of the funds current and deferred pension liabilities at that time.
During the year, an additional bulk annuity policy was purchased by the scheme for 3.9m.
The value of these policies and related liabilities at 30June 2016 were 703m 2015: 694m.
Genus plc Annual Report 2016 132 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2016 27.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Other defined benefit scheme in deficit The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development Company Limited.
The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2016, under the provisions of IAS 19 were 5.2m 2015: 5.0m and 6.5m 2015: 6.0m, respectively.
Other unfunded schemes When the Group acquired Sygen International plc, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous Groups senior employees and executives.
The scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amount to 8.0m 2015: 6.7m, based on IAS 19s methods and assumptions.
This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities amounted to 0.2m 2015: 0.2m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.8% 2015: 3.8% and that inflation and pension payment increases would be 2.7% per annum 2015: 3.1%.
The scheme liabilities for the unfunded retirement health benefit plan amounted to 0.9m 2015: 1.1m, based on IAS 19s methods and assumptions.
This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group Balance Sheet.
Interest on plan liabilities amounted to 0.1m 2015: 0.1m.
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.8% 2015: 3.8% and that the longterm rate of medical expense inflation would be 6.7% 2015: 7.1%.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Actuarial assumptions and sensitivity analysis Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date expressed as weighted averages : 2016 2015 Discount rate 2.8% 3.8% Consumer Price Index CPI 1.6% 2.0% Retail Price Index RPI 2.7% 3.1% The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes actuaries and reflect the latest available tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate.
For 2016, the mortality tables used are 97% of the SN2A tables, with birth year and 2014 CMI projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% for males and females 2015: the mortality tables used are 90% of the SN1A tables, with birth year and 2011 CMI projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% for males and females.
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the life expectancy of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years time.
2016 2015 Years Years Retiring at balance sheet date at age 65 Male 22.9 23.4 Female 25.1 25.9 Retiring at age 65 in 20 years time Male 24.6 25.2 Female 26.9 27.8 Duration of benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 30 June 2016 was 17.5 years 2015: 17.5 years.
Sensitivity analysis Measurement of the Groups defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease inthe present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2016.
Discount rate Rate of inflation Life expectancy Decrease by Increase by Decrease by Increase by Decrease by Increase by 0.25% 0.25% 0.25% 0.25% 1 year 1 year m m m m m m Increase decrease in present value of defined obligation 13.9 12.9 9.4 9.9 15.2 15.2 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that changes inassumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
The sensitivities assume the funds assets remain unchanged.
However, in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will also affect the value of the funds assets.
The funds investment strategy aims to hold matching assets which should move broadly in line with the liabilities of the funds so as to protect partially against changes in interest rates and inflation.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared using the same method as adopted when adjusting results of the latest funding valuation tothe balance sheet date.
This is the same approach adopted in previous periods.

Share-based payments We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and senior management as part of their remuneration.
A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant.
Accounting policies We recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Wemeasure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting period of each option.
We use a binomial valuation model to measure the fair value of options, and a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the fair value of share awards.
We adjust the amount we recognise as an expense, to reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
The Group recognised a total share-based payment expense of 3.8m 2015: 1.4m, including National Insurance contributions of0.4m 2015: nil.
Share awards There are 1,122,448 conditional share awards outstanding at 30 June 2016.
These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the 2004 Performance Share Plan on 10 September 2010, 7 December 2012, 26 September 2013 and 14 March 2014, and under the new 2014 Performance Share Plan on 20 November 2014 and 14 September 2015.
In accordance with the plans terms, participants have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option awards which will normally vest after three years, with the proportion of the award vesting depending on growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share.
Further details of the plans performance conditions are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In the year ended 30 June 2016, awards were granted on 14 September 2015, with an aggregate fair value of 5,316,000.
The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
At the date of grant, the fair value of a share awarded was 13.14, based on an expected dividend yield of 1.33%.

Acquisition of subsidiaries We completed the purchase of St Jacobs Animal Breeding Corp. during the year.
Accounting policies Business combinations We use the purchase method to account for all business combinations.
The cost of acquisition is the aggregate of the fair value at the date of exchange of assets we give, liabilities we incur or assume, and equity instruments we issue in exchange for control of the acquiree.
We recognise acquisition related costs in the profit and loss as we incur them.
We recognise the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, which meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS3, at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The exceptions are non-current assets or disposal Groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which we recognise and measure atfair value less costs to sell.
Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.
On 31 March 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of St Jacobs Animal Breeding Corp. St Jacobs, a bovine breeding company based in Vermont, US.
St Jacobs core capabilities are around the ability to identify and source genetics that target the Typeorshow cattle orientated segment of the dairy market.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.
m Intangible assets identified Trade name 0.7 Biological assets 1.9 Inventory 0.1 Financial liabilities 1.1 Total identifiable assets 1.6 Goodwill note 14 1.9 Total consideration 3.5 Satisfied by: Net cash outflow arising on acquisition of subsidiary 3.5 The goodwill of 1.9m arising from the acquisition consists largely of future growth and synergies expected from combining the acquired operations with existing Genus operations.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition and integration related costs included within exceptional items amount to 0.1m.
St Jacobs contributed no revenue and 0.1m profit to the Group for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheetdate.
If the acquisition of St Jacobs had been completed on the first day of the financial period, Group revenues and Group profit would have been no increase and 0.7m, respectively.

Post balance sheet events On 1 August 2016, the litigation commenced against Inguran, LLC aka Sexing Technologies ST. See note 7.
On 11August 2016, the jury also determined that: i STs 987 and 092 patents were valid and infringed: and ii that ABS had materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties.
On 12 August 2016, the jury determined that: i the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front payment of US$750,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$1.25 per straw on commercialisation of the GSS technology for the use of STs 987 patent: ii the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front payment of US$500,000 and ongoing royalty of US$0.50 per straw for the use of STs 092 patent: and iii ABS had materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties and damages were determined to beUS$750,000.
The Company and ABS has sought, among other things, judgement as a matter of law that the 987 patent is invalid and that the 092 patent is not infringed, or alternatively a new trial on the patent claims.
On 1 September 2016, we formed fide Novo Genetics, a 51% majority-owned Holstein breeding strategic partnership, with fide-Su Holsteins, LLC, the worlds leading independent Holstein breeder, for an initial and deferred cash consideration of 5.7m US$7.5m, and performance related deferred consideration which will not exceed 1.5m US$2m.
fide Novo will further accelerate the proportion of bulls Genus produces internally by combining ABSs and fide-Sus elite Holstein breeding programmes.
This will gives us greater control of the genetics we need in order to create differentiated solutions that help commercial dairy farmers increase profitability through improved herd productivity, health and efficiency.
