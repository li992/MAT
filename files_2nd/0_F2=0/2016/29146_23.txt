In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the preceding tables provide an analysis of these investments based on the fair value hierarchy described below, which reflects the reliability and significance of the information used to measure their fair value.
Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy used to analyse the fair values of financial assets is described below.
The levels are determined by the lowest that is the least reliable or least independently observable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement for the individual investment in its entirety as follows: Level 1 investments with quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 investments whose fair value is based directly on observable current market prices or is indirectly being derived from market prices: and Level 3 investments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by observable current market prices or are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on page 40.
The purchases and sales proceeds figures above include transaction costs of 275,000 2015 393,000 and 325,000 2015 473,000 respectively.

The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both losses and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Managers both assess the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitor the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9 and on pages 45 to 46.
50 Annual Report 2016 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and report to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Managers assess the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the country in which a company is listed is not necessarily where it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings can limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC 51 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Sensitivity At 31 March 2016, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the Financial Statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2015.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments outwith fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the market value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value at fair value.
52 Annual Report 2016 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Interest Rate Risk continued The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 March is shown below: Financial Assets 2016 2016 2015 2015 2016 Weighted Weighted 2015 Weighted Weighted Fair value average average period Fair value average average period 000 interest rate until maturity 000 interest rate until maturity Floating rate: Brazilian bonds index linked 17,241 11.0% 29 years 38,110 10.9% 30 years Cash and short term deposits: Other overseas currencies 11,196 n a 18,480 n a Sterling 32,777 0.3% n a 58,063 0.3% n a Based on expected maturity date.
The cash deposits generally comprise call or short term money market deposits of less than one month which are repayable on demand.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the Interbank market rates.
Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys bank loans and debentures at amortised cost and the maturity profile of the undiscounted future cash flows in respect of the Companys contractual financial liabilities at 31 March are shown below.
Interest Rate Risk Profile The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: 2016 2015 000 000 Floating rate US$ denominated 114,799 111,149 Fixed rate Sterling denominated 150,079 150,407 US$ denominated 233,076 225,665 497,954 487,221 Maturity Profile The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March was: 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 Within Between 1 More than Within Between 1 More than 1 year and 5 years 5 years 1 year and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Repayment of loans and debentures 288,736 79,139 125,675 111,149 225,665 145,675 Accumulated interest on loans and debentures to maturity date 18,094 55,125 44,209 17,795 58,414 59,595 306,830 134,264 169,884 128,944 284,079 205,270 Includes 675,000 irredeemable debenture stock.
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2016 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 2,177,000 2015 5,481,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 0.84p 2015 increased by 0.94p.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust PLC 53 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the short term fluctuations of the benchmark.
The Board provides guidance to the Managers on the level of unlisted investments.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 18 to 20.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest investments by their aggregate market value are contained in the Strategic Report.
99.5% 2015 106.8% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
A 3% increase in quoted companies equity valuations at 31 March 2016 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 103,177,000 2015 106,766,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is potentially significant but the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are believed to be readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding and to the maximum aggregate exposure to substantial holdings.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: Where the Investment Managers make an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: The Board regularly receives information from the Investment Managers on the credit ratings of those bonds and other securities in which the Company has invested: the Depositary is liable for the loss of financial instruments held in custody.
The Depositary will ensure that any delegate segregates the assets of the Company.
The Depositary has delegated the custody function to Bank of New York Mellon SA NV London Branch.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Managers.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations at the same time as any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: Transactions involving derivatives, and other arrangements wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Managers of the creditworthiness of that counterparty.
The Companys aggregate exposure to each such counterparty is monitored regularly by the Board: and Cash is held only at banks that are regularly reviewed by the Managers.
Credit Risk Exposure The maximum exposure to direct credit risk at 31 March was: 2016 2015 000 000 Fixed interest investments 17,241 38,110 Cash and short term deposits 43,973 76,543 Debtors and prepayments 4,051 3,693 65,265 118,346 None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
54 Annual Report 2016 Financial Report 19 Financial Instruments continued Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the Balance Sheet with the exception of long term borrowing.
Long term borrowings in relation to debentures are included in the accounts at the amortised amount of net proceeds after issue, plus accrued finance costs in accordance with FRS 102.
The fair value of bank loans is calculated with reference to government bonds of comparable maturity and yield.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 263.8p to 259.2p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2016 of 262.5p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 1.3% as against a discount of 0.5% on a debt at par basis.
At 31 March 2015 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 268.0p to 262.4p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2015 of 267.2p, this would have given a premium to net asset value of 1.8% as against a discount of 0.3% on a debt at par basis.
