NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements consolidate those of Hunting PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in associates.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC Interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
Thefinancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, the defined benefit pension asset and those financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss.
The Boards consideration of the applicability of the going concern basis is detailed further in the Strategic Report on page 38.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 37.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Adoption of New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted and are effective for the Groups accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2016: Amendments to IAS 19: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20122014 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20102012 Cycle Although the adoption of these amendments represents a change in accounting policy, comparative figures for 2015 have not been restated for these, as the changes do not impact the financial performance or position of the Group.
On 1 January 2016, the Group chose to adopt early the Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative, which is effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2017.
"This has resulted in the net debt reconciliation tables being presented in note 23 and being removed from the ""Non-GAAP Measures"" section."
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are effective subsequent to the year end and are being assessed to determine whether there is a significant impact on the Groups results or financial position: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers including amendments to IFRS 15: Effective date of IFRS 15 i IFRS 16 Leases i Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture i Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses i Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers i Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions i.
Not yet endorsed by the European Union.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The standard will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2018.
The impact of IFRS 9 is being assessed by management.
The main impact is likely to arise from the implementation of the expected loss model although full quantification of this impact is still underway.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
To date, management has undertaken a high level review of the Groups revenue generating activities and this has identified certain manufacturing activities that may possibly require an amendment to the Groups revenue accounting policies.
These manufacturing activities involve products that have been designed with the customer to meet their individual specifications.
The financial impact is not expected to be significant as 1 the total revenue streams from the cash-generating units that are impacted by the amendment are not individually significant, and 2 the requirement to apportion revenue to separate financial reporting periods will be impacted only when a product remains partly-manufactured at the reporting date: as the time period for the manufacture of these products is relatively short, management expects only a small portion of volumes to be in progress at the reporting date and therefore impacted by a change in accounting policy.
A full assessment of the financial impact will also require an extensive review of contractual terms with each relevant customer, in particular to identify matters of reimbursement in respect of in-progress contracts, and this will be undertaken during the early part of 2017.
IFRS 16 Leases replaces IAS 17 Leases and its related interpretations.
The standard will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2019.
The full impact of IFRS 16 has not yet been assessed, however management anticipates that a significant proportion of the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, as disclosed in note 35, shall be recognised as liabilities as a consequence of its implementation, together with a right of use asset.
The majority of the Group's operating lease arrangements relate toproperty leases, mainly in respect of our distribution centres.
As such, the lease term is generally short term in nature, with the majority of leases having an unexpired term of less than five years at 31 December 2016.
There will also be a positive impact on EBITDA as the lease costs will be presented as depreciation and interest expense in the income statement, rather than operating lease expense.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements and assumptions about the future, resulting in the use of accounting estimates.
These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results and adjustments will consequently be necessary.
Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, consultation with experts and reasonable expectations of future events.
Accounting estimates and judgements are applied in determining the carrying amounts of the following significant assets andliabilities: Asset liability Nature of estimates or judgement Goodwill The Group comprises a number of cash generating units CGUs, which are managed separately, typically being organised into country and or product line groupings, and that Carrying value at generate independent cash flows.
When goodwill is initially recognised upon a business 31 December 2016 combination, it is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination.
$229.8m 2015 $230.6m The goodwill of each CGU is subsequently reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing its carrying value with the recoverable amount.
"The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal ""FVLCD"" and value in use ""VIU""."
Management initially prepare calculations using the FVLCD basis which represents the value of the CGU in a sales transaction on an arms length basis.
In 2016 no impairments resulted from the FVLCD calculations and therefore no VIU estimates were prepared.
As there is no active market for the Group's CGUs, the FVLCD is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on the estimated future gross cash flows that are expected to be generated by the CGU and are discounted at a rate that is determined for each CGU in isolation by consideration of their business risk profiles.
The estimated future gross cash flows utilise independent market forecasts adjusted to reflect the Directors view of the CGU's future trading prospects and can include known growth projects.
Any shortfall in the recoverable amount is charged to the income statement immediately.
The continuing poor trading conditions were considered to be indicators of potential impairment and impairment reviews were carried out in preparation of the interim and full year results.
However, no impairment charges were recorded in 2016 as a result of the reviews.
Further details of goodwill are disclosed in note 15.
Property, plant and equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets except goodwill are and other intangible assets depreciated amortised at rates that are intended to spread the irrecoverable cost of the assets over their remaining useful lives.
Combined carrying value at On an annual basis, management review the estimates of the useful lives, residual values and the 31 December 2016 expected pattern of consumption of their carrying values with any change made prospectively.
$569.7m 2015 $641.2m Inaddition, management consider whether there are indicators of impairment.
In addition, the carrying value of each asset must not be less than the minimum future benefits that are expected to be generated by that asset.
The impairment exercise referred to in relation to goodwill above, also provides comfort regarding the aggregate carrying value of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets were reviewed.
No impairment charges were recorded in 2016 as a result of the review.
The depreciation rates currently in use are disclosed in note 37.
Further details of the Groups property, plant and equipment and the other intangible assets are disclosed in notes 14 and 16respectively.
"Inventories The carrying value of the Groups inventory must be stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value ""NRV""."
NRV is the selling price of a product as at the balance sheet date minus the costs Cost at 31 December 2016 to be incurred in completing the product and minus the costs to sell the product.
$286.4m 2015 $351.1m : In determining an estimate of NRV, management has made judgements in respect of the inventory provisions at durability and general high quality of the Groups products, which provide a certain degree of 31 December 2016 $26.7m protection against adverse market conditions, and competitor product development and pricing 2015 $19.9m : carrying value activity.
at 31 December 2016 $259.7m The significant downturn in the industry has reduced transaction volumes meaning that some 2015 $331.2m items of inventory may not have been sold near the balance sheet date, increasing the level of judgement required.
Some market transactions reflect the actions of distressed sellers and are not applicable to the market as a whole.
Overall, Huntings provision has increased from 5.7% of gross inventory balances at December 2015 to 9.3% at December 2016.
Included in the carrying value of inventory is $57.3m 2015 $28.0m held at NRV.
In light of the improving market conditions, management do not expect a material adverse increase in inventory provisions in 2017.
Details of the Groups inventories are disclosed in note 20.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 93 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements continued Asset liability Nature of estimates or judgement Taxation We operate in a number of countries around the world and tax computations and supporting calculations are prepared in accordance with tax legislation enacted or substantively enacted at Carrying value of the the balance sheet date for each jurisdiction.
Interpretation of tax legislation sometimes requires net tax liability at estimates, judgement and an appropriate assessment of the tax risks to be used in determining 31 December 2016 the tax charge or credit as uncertainties exist in relation to the interpretation of complex tax $3.4m 2015 $10.7m net asset legislation, changes in tax laws and the amount and timing of future taxable income.
The principal areas of uncertainty for Hunting relate to transfer pricing arrangements for intragroup trading.
We regularly conduct market benchmark studies for material markets and transaction flows in this area to determine reasonable price levels.
These require an assessment of appropriate comparable transactions and the determination of the appropriate base to use under the OECD rules which is judgemental in nature.
Our global trading activities can also inadvertently create taxable permanent establishments in countries depending on the nature of the sales and import processes.
We have reviewed our level of risk and currently do not expect any material change in provisions in 2017.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
This assessment is made on the basis of long-term business forecasts approved by the Board.
We have unrecognised tax losses as shown in note 19.
The deferred tax balances at 31 December 2016 represent an estimate of the amounts that are expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities in future periods if assets and liabilities in the balance sheet were recovered at their carrying values based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax balances therefore require us to assess the applicable tax legislation and rates, the timing of the reversal of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences and the nature, timing and amount of taxable income which would potentially be available to support the recognition of deferred tax assets note 19.
We base estimates of the recoverability of deferred tax assets using these criteria for each separate significant category of deductible temporary difference and losses carried forward.
Segmental Reporting For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group reports on five operating segments, one being a discontinued operation, in its internal management reports which are used to make strategic decisions by the Hunting PLC Board, the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Groups continuing operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies and undertake exploration and production activities.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit or loss from operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced in line with the transfer pricing policy on an arms length basis.
a Continuing Operations The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers during the drilling phase of oil and gas wells, along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out and precision machining services for the energy, aviation and power generation sectors.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers during the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers during the production, maintenance and restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment comprises the Groups oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
The Board of Hunting will not be making any new capital investment, beyond where the division has contractual commitments.
No exploration and evaluation activities have occurred during the year.
The division will in future focus on producing out its remaining reserves, with a view to winding down the operation.
Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the continuing operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.
b Discontinued Operations The discontinued operations comprise Gibson Shipbrokers, which was sold on 31 March 2015 and Gibson Energy, which was sold in2008.
Gibson Energy continues to generate accounting entries due to sale-related transactions and is required to be reported for reconciliation purposes.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes tothe CODM.

As part of the Group's restructuring, a decision to close the Group's European Drilling Tools business was made.
Assets of $1.6m were classified as held for sale at 30June 2016, with an impairment charge of $2.9m being posted to the income statement to recognise the assets at their net realisable value.
Following a review of the net realisable value at 31 December 2016, a fair value loss of $1.6m has been recognised, reducing the carrying value of the held for sale assets to $nil.
The impairment charge of $2.9m and the fair value loss of $1.6m have been included in restructuring costs of $12.2m.
On 11 March 2016, it was agreed that the defined benefit pension section of the Group's UK pension scheme would be closed to future accrual of further benefits from 30 June 2016.
The active members have been offered membership of the defined contribution section of the scheme from 1 July 2016.
The effect of this change has been recognised in the 2016 financial statements, resulting in again on the curtailment of future defined benefit scheme accruals of $6.5m and a past service cost of $9.6m on defined benefit members' uplift on 11 March 2016, the net charge being $3.1m.

Amortisation and Exceptional Items continued A series of amendments to the Group's borrowing facilities became effective on 20 July 2016, see note 27 for further details.
"For accounting purposes, as the revised Revolving Credit Facility ""RCF"" size and covenant terms were significantly different, the existing RCF was deemed to have been extinguished and replaced by a new facility."
Consequently, the unamortised portion of the capitalised loan facility fees of $2.5m relating to the RCF negotiations in 2015 have been written off to the income statement.
During 2015, plant and equipment impairment of $26.8m was recognised in the US Drilling Tools business following a review of the carrying value given the trading conditions and future expectations at the time and an impairment charge of $6.4m for oil and gas exploration and development expenditure was recorded, bringing the impairment charge for 2015 to $33.2m.
A detailed review on the carrying values of goodwill held by Huntings relevant businesses was undertaken at the half and full year, which confirmed that no further impairments beyond those recorded in 2015 were required.
Following a detailed review in 2015, agoodwill impairment charge of $208.2m was recognised.
See note 15 for further details.
An impairment charge of $11.2m for other intangible assets was recognised in 2015 following a review of customer relationships arising on the acquisition of the Hunting Electronics and Hunting Doffing businesses.

The $7.5m charge comprises of deferred tax.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the Chancellor's Budget on 16 March 2016.
These include reductions to the main rate of corporation tax to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The Finance Bill 2016, which included these changes, received Royal Assent on 15 September 2016.
The Finance Bill 2015 included a reduction to the main corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017.
The changes are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups UK deferred tax balances.

Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of alldilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2016 2015 $m $m Basic and diluted loss earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders From continuing operations 115.7 230.8 From discontinued operations 8.2 4.2 Total 107.5 226.6 i Basic and diluted loss earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders before amortisation and exceptional items From continuing operations 115.7 230.8 i Add: amortisation and exceptional items after taxation 47.5 235.4 Total 68.2 4.6 From discontinued operations 8.2 4.2 Less: exceptional items after taxation 8.2 4.2 Total millions millions Basic weighted average number of Ordinary shares 150.7 147.8 Dilutive outstanding share options 0.1 Long-term incentive plans 6.4 2.0 Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 157.1 149.9 cents cents a Reported Loss Earnings per Share Basic EPS From continuing operations 76.8 156.1 From discontinued operations 5.5 2.8 71.3 153.3 ii Diluted EPS From continuing operations 76.8 156.1 From discontinued operations 5.5 2.8 71.3 153.3 b Underlying Loss Earnings per Share Basic EPS From continuing operations 45.3 3.1 From discontinued operations 45.3 3.1 ii Diluted EPS From continuing operations 45.3 3.1 From discontinued operations 45.3 3.1 i.

The assets of the Groups European Drilling Tools rental business were classified as held for sale during the year.
With the market slowdown impacting the Group's Asia Pacific operations, certain regional assets were impaired, with a $0.6m charge recognised.
Included in the net book amount is expenditure relating to assets in the course of construction of $0.1m 2015 $50.2m for land and buildings, $8.8m 2015 $26.3m for plant and machinery and $0.8m 2015 $2.5m for rental tools.
Group capital expenditure committed for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, but not provided for in these financial statements, amounted to $1.2m 2015 $4.8m.

As a result of the amendments to the Group's financial covenants over the bank facility in 2016, security has been granted over specific properties in the UK and US, which have a carrying value of $239.2m 2015 $nil.
Oil and gas productive and development assets are tested for impairment at least annually.
Following a valuation of oil and gas reserves at 31 December 2016, performed for impairment purposes, no impairment charges were required 2015 $6.4m reflecting a stabilisation in the market, principally of commodity prices.
The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and the income and costs in generating this production.
Cash flows are based on productive lives between one and fifteen years and are discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 12% 2015 12%.
The carrying value of PPE assets in certain CGUs remains sensitive to potential declines in future revenue growth rates.
"Based on the impairment test process described in note 15, if the expected compound annual growth rate ""CAGR"" for revenue between 2016 and 2021 for US Drilling Tools fell by 2%, for UK OCTG fell by 2% or for Canada fell by 3% impairments could be required."
The net book value of PPE for US Drilling Tools is $60.5m, for UK OCTG is $8.0m and for Canada is $4.2m.
There is no reasonably foreseeable change in revenue growth rates that would give rise to impairment charges in other CGUs.

Goodwill continued Impairment Tests for Goodwill The continuing poor trading conditions and the subsequent renegotiation of bank facilities were considered indicators of potential impairment and impairment tests were carried out in preparation for interim and year end reporting.
"The recoverable amount for each CGU has been determined using a fair value less costs of disposal ""FVLCD"" method, which represents the value of the CGU in a sales transaction on an arms length basis."
This method allows approved capital projects that are in progress to be included.
The recoverable amount calculations use discounted pre-tax nominal cash flow projections.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount calculations are revenue growth rates, taking into account the impact these have on margins, terminal growth rates and the discount rates applied.
For 2017, cash flows are based on the approved Board budget.
For 2018 to 2021, management has made revenue projections using Spears and Associates Drilling and Production Outlook reports as a default basis, selecting the most appropriate geographic market and driver rig count, footage drilled or E&P spend for each CGU.
Management has then applied judgemental changes to revenue growth expectations, if appropriate, to reflect circumstances specific to the CGU.
Having determined the projected revenues, management has then modelled the expected impact on margins and cash flow from the resulting revenue projections.
Whilst market conditions have stabilised in 2016, and there are now some signs of recovery, the speed and extent of the recovery is difficult to predict and it will impact CGUs differently.
The compound annual growth rates CAGR for revenue for the CGUs between 2016 and 2021 vary between 9% and 26%.
These growth rates should be seen in the context of the year-on-year declines in revenue in 2015 and 2016 which were 42% and 44% respectively.
After 2021, a terminal value has been calculated assuming growth above inflation of 50 basis points, giving nominal growth rates between 1% and 6%.
For material CGUs this is between 2% and 3%.
Cash flows have been discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 10% and 18%.
The discount rates reflect current market assessments of the equity market risk premiums, the volatility of returns, the risks associated with the cash flows, the likely external borrowing rate of the CGU and expected levels of leverage.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
Management remains confident that market fundamentals will drive a significant recovery in the sector and this assessment of the mid to long-term outlook has not changed materially since 31 December 2015.
No impairment charges have been recorded as a result of the impairment reviews carried out in the year.
b Material CGU Hunting Perforating Systems Hunting Perforating Systems represents 79% of the goodwill balance at the year end 2015 78% andhas a carrying value, including amounts recognised on consolidation such as goodwill, of $448.2m 2015 $503.0m.
Projected annual growth rates vary between 13% and 31%.
Cash flows have been discounted at a nominal pre-tax rate of 12%.
There is no reasonably foreseeable change in revenue growth rates, or terminal growth rates, or discount rates which will give rise to impairment charges.
c Sensitivities The carrying value of certain CGUs is dependent on the strength and speed of the expected recovery in the sector.
The following sensitivities have been considered.
i Revenue growth rates The only reasonably foreseeable change in CAGR which could give rise to an impairment charge relates to the Welltonic CGU.
ForthisCGU a 5% reduction in the expected CAGR for revenue between 2016 and 2021 would result in the full impairment of the remaining $4.6m of goodwill.
ii Terminal growth rates A fall in terminal growth rate expectations of 25 basis points would not give rise to any impairment charges.
iii Discount rates For Hunting Perforating Systems, Hunting Stafford, Hunting Dearborn, US Manufacturing and Hunting Specialty nominal pre-tax discount rates of 12% have been applied.
For Welltonic the discount rate is 11%.
An increase in pre-tax discount rates of 50 basis points would give rise to a $0.7m impairment to the Welltonic CGU.
No other goodwill balances would be impacted.

Receivables that have been impaired mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or concerns have been raised about the customers liquidity.
Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
During the year, a provision of $2.2m 2015 $0.7m for the impairment of receivables was recognised, $0.2m 2015 $nil receivables were written off and $0.3m 2015 $0.5m unused provisions were released.
The provision for the impairment of trade receivables at the year end was $4.4m 2015 $2.7m.
The other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups wide and unrelated customer base.
Themaximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable.
The carrying value of each class of receivable approximates their fair value as described in note 26.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral previouslyheld.
As a result of the amendments to the Group's financial covenants over the bank facility in 2016, security has been granted over certain trade receivables and other receivables in the UK, US and Canada, which have a gross value of $75.7m 2015 $nil.

Changes in Net Debt Hunting operates a centralised treasury function that manages all cash and loan positions throughout the Group and ensures fundsare used efficiently through the use of interest offsetting arrangements and other such measures.
As the Group manages funding ona net debt basis, internal reporting focuses on changes in net debt and this is presented in the Strategic Report.
Thenetdebt reconciliation provides an analysis of the movement in the year for each component of net debt split between cash andnon-cash items.
Net debt comprises bank overdrafts, current and non-current borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits maturing after more than three months.

Prior to this occurring, management had been in discussions with the bank lending group to seek amendments to the covenants.
Foraccounting purposes, as the revised facility size and covenant terms were significantly different, the RCF was deemed to have been extinguished and replaced by a new RCF.
Consequently, capitalised loan facility fees of $2.5m were written off to the income statement.
Further details on the revised terms are provided in note 27.

It is expected that $1.9m of the provision will be utilised in 2017, $0.7m in 2018 and the remaining balance of $3.0m utilised from 2019 to 2023.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.01% and 0.69% p. a. for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.

The asset decommissioning provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise inmeeting this obligation.
Provision is made on a discounted basis, the majority of which is estimated to be utilised over a period of fourteen years.
Derivatives and Hedging a Currency Derivatives The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during theyear.
At 31 December 2016, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was $1.9m 2015$3.1m.
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement, with$nil 2015 $0.2m loss being recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts during the year.
These forecast transactions all occurred during 2016.
Gains and losses recognised during the year on these contracts were immaterial.

Following the equity placing in October 2016, the Group repaid a large portion of its borrowings.
At 31 December 2016, the carrying amount of net Canadian dollar borrowings designated as a hedge was $nil 2015 $21.1m and the carrying amount of net Sterling borrowings was $19.6m 2015 $22.1m.
During 2016, foreign exchange gains of $2.5m 2015 $5.1m on translation of the borrowings into US dollars were recognised in the currency translation reserve.

Financial Instruments: Fair Values The carrying value of investments, non-current trade and other receivables, net trade receivables, accrued revenue, other receivables, deposits maturing after three months, cash and cash equivalents, assets classified as held for sale, trade payables, accruals, otherpayables, provisions, liabilities classified as held for sale, bank overdrafts, unsecured bank loans and other unsecured loans approximates their fair value.
Drawdowns under the revolving credit facility are typically for periods of one month or less and, as a result, the carrying value and the fair value are considered to be the same.
The following tables present the Groups other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the year end and show the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements are categorised.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by comparing the cash flows generated by the contract with the coterminous cash flows potentially available in the forward exchange market on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of listed equities and mutual funds is based on their current bid prices in an active market, which is considered to be the most representative of fair value, at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of non-US dollar denominated financial instruments are translated into US dollars using the year end exchange rate.
The inputs used to determine the fair value of derivative financial instruments are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and so the fair value measurement is categorised in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of listed equity investments and mutual funds is based on quoted market prices and so the fair value measurement is categorised in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange and interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign Exchange Risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of Sterling and Canadian dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows, and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 27.
Financial Risk Management continued The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: Sterling Canadian dollar 2016 2015 2016 2015 Average exchange rate to US dollars 0.74 0.65 1.33 1.28 Year end exchange rate to US dollars 0.81 0.68 1.34 1.39 i Transactional Risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts or currency options.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling 12-month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a 12-month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than $400,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed $400,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

ii Translational Risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional currency as that of the net assets.
The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from Sterling and Canadian dollar denominated net investments.
b Interest Rate Risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and uses interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 114 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 27.
Financial Risk Management continued c Credit Risk The Groups credit risk arises from its pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments, loannote and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum A2, P2 or F2 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies respectively and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
At the year end, cash at bank and in hand totalled $63.5m 2015 $54.4m and current investments $0.8m 2015 $4.6m.
88% 2015 90% of cash at bank and in hand balances were deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
Of the remaining 12% 2015 10%, the vast majority 10% was held on deposit with two financial institutions within mainland China which, given the Groups operations in this jurisdiction, were deemed necessary.
Despite not having formal credit ratings, an internal assessment determined that the banks' credit profiles were appropriate for the amounts held on deposit.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Group operates a pension scheme in the UK, which includes a funded defined benefit section with pension plan net assets of $33.3m 2015 $41.4m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been effected by using a number of insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded.
Contributions are paid into a separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised as non-current investments.
Investments at the year end amounted to $10.2m 2015 $9.1m and are expected to be fully recovered.
d Liquidity Risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly cash forecasts to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total $219.2m 2015 $414.6m at the year end.
The facilities comprise $200.0m of secured committed facilities 2015 $350.0m unsecured, and $19.2m secured uncommitted facilities 2015 $64.6m unsecured.
Due to losses reported in the relevant test period, the financial covenants relating to the Groups $350m Revolving Credit Facility RCF were breached at 30 June 2016.
In anticipation of this event, management commenced discussions with the lending banks toseek amendments to the terms and conditions relating to the RCF and the other funding arrangements available to the Group.
On20 July 2016 the revised terms became effective.
The main revised covenants and terms to apply throughout the suspension period, which runs up to and including the 30 June 2018 covenant test date, are: Committed facilities reduced from $350m to $200m to reflect the Groups reduced requirements.
First priority security charge taken by the bank group over certain trade receivables and inventories held by Group subsidiaries inthe US, Canada and UK subsidiaries, together with security charges over the Groups principal properties in the US and UK.
Drawings under the committed facilities to be covered by the secured assets.
The balance of discounted trade receivables and accrued revenue values shall not be less than 40% of the utilisation of the committed facilities.
Tangible net worth of the Group must exceed $450m.
Rolling 12-month cash flow targets tested semi annually.
Capital expenditure limited to a maximum of $30m per annum in 2017 and 2018.
Cessation of dividend payments until the end of the suspension period.
An amendment fee of $400,000 was payable and the interest margin over LIBOR on funds drawn increases to 2.75%.
As at 31 December 2016, all covenants were covered with adequate headroom and the Group remained compliant with the amended terms and conditions of the committed facilities.
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the EBITDA interest cover covenants included in the facility agreement signed in October 2015 have been suspended until the 30 June 2018 covenant test date.
If trading conditions improve before the end of the amendment period then Hunting can elect to return to the original facility covenants.
The Groups treasury function ensures flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.
The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end totalling $179.5m 2015 $233.9m, which expire between two and five years.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position asat 31 December 2016.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 116 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 28.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in ratesdoes not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed-rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.
a Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 0.5% 2015 0.5% for US interest rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future interest rates.
The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.5% 2015 0.5% in US interest rates, is to reduce profits by $nil 2015 $0.3m.
If US interest rates were to decrease by 0.5% 2015 0.5%, then the post-tax impact on the income statement would be to increase profits by $nil 2015 $0.3m.
The movements in 2015 arose on US dollar denominated borrowings.
There is no impact on other comprehensive income OCI for a change in interest rates.
b Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 15% 2015 10% for Sterling and 5% 2015 10% Canadian dollar and Singapore dollar exchange rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future foreign exchange rates.
The table below shows the post-tax impact for the year of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December.
2016 2015 Income Income statement OCI statement OCI $m $m $m $m Sterling exchange rate 15% 2015: 10% 0.9 0.3 0.8 Sterling exchange rate -15% 2015: -10% 1.1 0.3 0.9 Canadian dollar exchange rates 5% 2015: 10% 0.5 0.8 0.1 Canadian dollar exchange rates -5% 2015: -10% 0.6 0.9 0.1 Singapore dollar exchange rates 5% 2015: 10% 0.3 Singapore dollar exchange rates -5% 2015: -10% 0.1 0.4 The movements in the income statement mainly arise from cash, bank overdrafts, intra-group balances, trade receivables and payables and accrued expenses, where the functional currency of the entity is different from the currency that the monetary items are denominated in.
The movements in OCI arise from net Sterling borrowings designated in a hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries andfromSterling and Canadian dollar denominated loans that have been recognised as part of the Groups net investment in foreignsubsidiaries.
Post-Employment Benefits a UK Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to price inflation and a defined contribution section with benefits dependent on future investment returns.
The defined benefit section closed to future accrual on 30 June 2016 and existing contributing members of that section joined the defined contribution section with effect from 1 July 2016.
The majority of UK employees are members of the defined contribution section of the scheme.
The UK scheme is registered with HMRC for tax purposes, is operated separately from the Group and is managed by a board of trustees.
The trustees are responsible for the payment of benefits and the management of the schemes assets.
The UK scheme is subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and the trustees to agree a funding strategy and contributions schedule for the defined benefit section of the UK scheme.
Contributions due to the defined contribution section of the UK scheme and other Group defined contribution arrangements are charged directly to profit and loss.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 117 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
Post-Employment Benefits continued Risk exposures and investment strategy The scheme is managed so that it is well funded and represents a low risk to the Group.
In particular, the schemes assets are invested ina range of deferred annuity and immediate annuity policies with a number of insurers, which largely match the benefits to be paid to members of the scheme.
This strategy significantly reduces the Groups investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to the schemes liabilities.
The position would change materially if one of the insurers was no longer able to meet its obligations as the pension obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
The decrease in the Group's pension asset seen over 2016 principally reflects the agreement of the trustees and the Group to meet the contributions of the defined contribution section from the surplus in the scheme and the loss as a result of the closure of the defined benefit section, partially offset by the gain arising from the trustees' decision to surrender part of one of their insurance annuity policies.
Funding strategy The trustees and the Group together agree a funding strategy for the UK scheme every three years.
As the defined benefit section is closed to future accrual and the benefits earned by the members are covered in full by annuity policies, the Group does not expect topay any further contributions into the defined benefit section of the scheme.
The trustees and the Group have also agreed that contributions to the defined contribution section can be met from the excess assets in the scheme for the time being and that a repayment of 12.0m $14.8m net of tax of 4.2m $5.2m from the scheme to the Group has been made on 24 February 2017.
The net assets for the UK post-employment benefit scheme are: 2016 2015 $m $m Present value of obligations 418.3 387.1 Total fair value of plan assets 451.6 428.5 Net asset 33.3 41.4 The net asset is recognised in the balance sheet as follows: 2016 2015 $m $m Non-current 18.5 41.4 Current 14.8 Net asset 33.3 41.4 Changes in the net asset recognised in the balance sheet 2016 2015 $m $m Opening balance sheet net asset 41.4 30.9 Exchange adjustments 6.7 2.1 Expense charged to the income statement continuing operations 0.9 2.9 Past service cost charged to the income statement continuing operations 3.1 Past service cost credited to the income statement discontinued operations 5.5 Amount recognised in other comprehensive income 4.2 10.6 Transfer to defined contribution section 1.6 1.8 Employers contributions paid 1.2 Closing balance sheet net asset 33.3 41.4 The Group has concluded that it can recognise the full amount of the surplus on the grounds that it could gain sufficient economic benefit from a future reduction of its contributions to the defined contribution section of the scheme or through a future refund from the scheme.
This is happening in practice as contributions to the defined contribution section are already being met from the scheme's excess assets and a repayment to the Group has been agreed for 2017.
Amendments to the current accounting rules on recognising a surplus IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction are currently being considered.
The Group has concluded that the above accounting treatment will not be affected by the current proposed changes to these rules.

The gain due to the changes in the assumptions broadly offsets the corresponding loss on the remeasurement of the defined benefit obligation, demonstrating that thepensions related risks have largely been mitigated by the schemes investment strategy.

In addition, employer contributions of $6.7m 2015 $8.3m for various Group defined contribution arrangements including the defined contribution section of the UK scheme are recognised in the income statement.
Special events As part of the closure of the defined benefit section, existing contributing members of that section were given a one-off uplift to their pensions.
The net effect of the closure and these uplifts has been recognised in the income statement.
A repayment from the scheme to the Group of excess assets of 7.8m net of tax approximately $9.6m has been agreed for 2017.
The impact of this repayment will be reflected in the 2017 financial statements.
It has also been agreed that the defined benefit section of the scheme will be wound up, with the insurance annuity policies transferred into the names of the individual members.
The principal assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions are: 2016 2015 Discount rate 2.6% p. a.
Future salary increase n a 5.3% p. a. Mortality assumption life expectancy 2016 2015 Years Years Male aged 65 at the accounting date 25.1 25.0 Female aged 65 at the accounting date 27.8 27.7 Male aged 65 in 20 years 27.0 26.9 Female aged 65 in 20 years 29.3 29.1 The assumptions used to determine the end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following years cost.
Sensitivity analysis The weighted average duration to payment of the projected future cash flows from the defined benefit section of the scheme is about17 years.
As the defined benefit section is closed to future accrual and members' benefits are covered in full by annuity policies, any change in the obligation arising as a result of changes in the above assumptions is broadly matched by a corresponding change in the value of the insurance policies, so that the impact on the net balance sheet asset is significantly dampened.
The net balance sheet is therefore only largely sensitive to changes in the market value of the invested assets.
The investment strategy for the defined benefit section, with all funds in either annuity policies or cash, should mean the surplus figure is stable.
b Other Pensions The Group also operates a cash balance arrangement in the US for certain executives.
Members build up benefits in this arrangement by way of notional contributions and notional investment returns.
Actual contributions are paid into an entirely separate investment vehicle held by the Company, which is used to pay benefits due from the cash balance arrangement when the member retires.
Under IAS 19, the cash balance arrangement is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit scheme, although in practice it operates like a defined contribution arrangement with the obligations matched by the assets in the separate investment vehicle.
The amounts recognised in the income statement during the year were $0.1m 2015 $0.2m for the employers current service cost recognised in operating expenses and $0.3m 2015 $0.3m interest cost recognised in finance expense.

Share-Based Payments a 2001 Executive Share Option Plan The Company operated an executive share option plan between 2001 and 2008 which granted options to eligible employees.
Under this scheme, the final granting of options occurred on 4 March 2008 and the final vesting of options occurred on 4 March 2011.
There is no longer a charge to the income statement attributable to this scheme.
Following successful vesting of the options, the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.

Share-Based Payments continued iii Fair Value of HPSP Awards The fair value of awards granted under the HPSP is calculated using two separate models: 1 The fair value of awards subject to a market-related performance condition, specifically Company performance against the TSR ofa bespoke peer group, has been calculated using the Stochastic pricing model also known as the Monte Carlo model.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2016 2015 Date of grant valuation date 11.03.16 28.04.15 Weighted average share price at grant 379.0p 590.5p Exercise price nil nil Expected dividend yield nil nil Expected volatility 48.1% 36.5% Risk-free rate 0.57% 0.73% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 258.7p 300.5p 2 The fair value of performance-based awards not subject to a market-related performance condition, specifically Company performance against EPS and ROCE targets, and the time-based HPSP awards has been calculated using the Black-Scholes pricingmodel.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: 2016 2015 Date of grant valuation date 11.03.16 28.04.15 Weighted average share price at grant 379.0p 590.5p Exercise price nil nil Expected dividend yield nil nil Expected volatility 48.1% 36.5% Risk-free rate 0.57% 0.73% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 379.0p 590.5p The methods to calculate the assumptions for both models are: The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility, equal in length to the remaining portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk-free rate is based on the UKgilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance conditions.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the performance-based HPSP awards granted under the HPSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge for 2016 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The amount charged to the income statement attributable to the performance-based HPSP awards is $0.5m 2015 $0.2m credit and the charge to the income statement in respect of time-based HPSP awards is $7.0m 2015 $4.3m.
These are recognised in operating expenses.
d Other Share Awards On 9 May 2016 31,585 shares and on 27 June 2016 20,000 shares were awarded to certain employees and were satisfied by sharesheld in the Hunting Employee Benefit Trust.
The closing mid-market price on 9 May 2016 was 331.25 pence per share and on 27June 2016 was 411.75 pence per share.
The charge to the income statement attributable to these awards is $0.2m 2015 $nil, bringing the total charge to the income statement for the year to $8.2m 2015 $6.2m.

Principal Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below: a Consolidation The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Consequently, the consideration is determined as the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
b Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and are shown net of tax.
The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, that have not been disposed of prior to the balance sheet date, are presented separately in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.
c Revenue Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods, services and rental supplies in the ordinary course of business, net of trade discounts, volume rebates, and sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is normally on delivery of the products.
Products include manufactured goods and OCTG supplies, including tubulars acquired by Hunting as plain-end pipe on which lathing work has been applied and which is resold as threaded pipe.
Revenue from the sale of services principally comprises lathing work to apply a thread on to customer-owned plain-end pipe.
Revenue is recognised when the threading work has been completed.
Revenue from the sale of other services is recognised when the services are rendered.
Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
d Amortisation and Exceptional Items Exceptional items are items of income or expense which the Directors believe should be separately disclosed by virtue of their significant size or nature to enable a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
The Group discloses such items inthe middle column of the income statement.
In applying this policy, the following items have been treated as exceptional: Net losses incurred on the closure of the defined benefit section of the Groups UK pension scheme.
Costs of restructuring the Groups operations, including the cost of business closures and redundancies, in response to the decline in the oil and gas sector.
Derecognition of the bank facility arrangement fees that were incurred and capitalised in October 2015 upon the inception of the Groups new multicurrency revolving credit facility.
The unamortised balance of these fees was written off when the terms of the facility were significantly revised in July 2016.
During 2015, the following items, which did not recur in 2016, were treated as exceptional: Impairment charges to goodwill, other intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment were recognised in 2015 to reflect the protracted decline in the oil and gas sector, a prolonged period of customer fide-stocking and increased competition.
Impairments of property, plant and equipment specifically held by the Exploration and Production division were recognised in 2015.
As the valuations are subject to the frequent changes in long-term oil and gas prices, such impairments can lead to volatility in the income statement that is unrelated to the underlying performance of the business.
The tax effect of any transaction considered to be exceptional is also treated as exceptional.
Amortisation expenses for acquired intangible assets are also shown in the middle column due to the significance of these amounts and to clearly identify the effect on profits, which will arise as current balances become fully written-off, or as new acquisitions give rise to new expenses.
e Interest Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.

Principal Accounting Policies continued f Foreign Currencies i Individual Subsidiaries and Associates Accounts The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and associates are denominated in their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denominated in non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.
ii Group Consolidated Accounts The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars.
The net assets of non-US dollar denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of subsidiaries and associates are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the currency translation reserve CTR, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
Upon adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2004, accumulated exchange differences arising on consolidation prior to 31 December 2003 were reset to zero and the CTR recommenced under IFRS on 1 January 2004.
The balance on the CTR represents the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-US dollar amounts into US dollars since 1 January 2004.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the CTR relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
g Taxation The taxation recognised in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current years result before tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years results.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable arising in the current year on the current years result before tax, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax in respect of prior years results.
Deferred tax is the tax that is expected to arise when the assets and liabilities recognised in the Groups balance sheet are realised, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
When items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, the current and deferred tax relating to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Tax arising on the discharge of share options and awards is recognised directly in equity.
h Segmental Reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is disclosed in the accounts.
Operating segments are components of the Group that are engaged in providing related products.
Geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.
i Property, Plant and Equipment i General Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
With the exception of drilling tools, which are depreciated using the units of production method, and oil and gas exploration and production equipment see ii below, assets are depreciated using the straight-line method at the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 10% Leasehold buildings life of lease 1 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6% to 33 3% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 129 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 37.
Principal Accounting Policies continued ii Exploration Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves and are included in the asset category oil and gas exploration and development.
Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences.
The costs are depreciated using the unit of production method.
j Goodwill Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
k Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, orwhenthiscannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods: Customer relationships eight to ten years Patents eight to ten years Unpatented technology eight to ten years Trademarks and domain names one to five years l Impairments The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired.
An impairment review is carried out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cashflows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of a its fair value minus costs to sell: and b its value in use.
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment to goodwill is never reversed.
When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not originally been made.
m Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal inthe ordinary course of business.
The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
n Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in currentliabilities.
o Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration paid plus transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a loan or receivable is impaired and, if necessary, the carrying amount is reduced to the appropriate value.
The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Loans and receivables cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 130 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 37.
Principal Accounting Policies continued p Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group subsequently remeasures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
q Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
The measurement of a provision is based on the most likely amount and timing of the expenditures.
Payments that are expected to arise after more than one year are discounted to their present value using a risk-free interest rate that is relevant to the region in which the past event occurred.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the redemption yields of government securities.
r Post-Employment Benefits i Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
ii Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes are recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the current year, which for the funded scheme is measured using the Projected Unit method and for the unfunded scheme is equal to the contributions paid.
Net interest arising on the net assets of the schemes is also recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Curtailment gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The assets of the funded scheme, which are invested in insurance policies, have been valued using the same methodology and assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation so that, where the assets match the liabilities, the value of the assets is equal to the value of the corresponding obligation.
s Share-Based Payments The Group issues equity-settled, share-based payments HPSP awards to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
The fair value of the employees services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
The obligation to settle these awards is recognised within other components of equity.
t Share Capital The Companys share capital comprises a single class of Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are charged to equity as a deduction from the proceeds, netoftax.
u Merger Reserve The merger reserve comprises the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, in excess of the nominal value of the Ordinary shares issued by way of the share placing completed on 31 October 2016.
In accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the premium was credited to the merger reserve, instead of to the share premium account, because the share placing was pursuant to the Company securing over 90% of another entity.
The proceeds were used to pay down the Groups borrowings at that time.
The reserve is currently non-distributable and will be transferred to distributable retained earnings when the proceeds meet the definition of a qualifying consideration.
v Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as liabilities in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
All dividends are dealt with in the statement of changes in equity.
