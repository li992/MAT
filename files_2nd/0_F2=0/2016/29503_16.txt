These calls come from fraudsters operating in boiler rooms that are mostly based abroad.
While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money.
The Financial Conduct Authority FCA has found most share fraud victims are experienced investors who lose an average of 20,000, with around 200m lost in the UK each year.
