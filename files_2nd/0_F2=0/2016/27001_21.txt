Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Reporting entity Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc the Company is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The registered office is located at Victoria House, Victoria Road, Horley, Surrey RH6 7AF, United Kingdom.
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries collectively the Group.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 16 February 2017.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment properties and, from 1 January 2005, derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale which are stated at their fair values.
Hotel properties are stated at cost or deemed cost.
Deemed cost is calculated based on the hotels frozen valuation as at 1 January 2004.
Noncurrent assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identifies operating profit and other operating income and expense.
This is in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.
The financial statements are presented in the Companys functional currency of sterling, rounded to the nearest million.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Basis of accounting These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as required by EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002.
Details of the Groups accounting policies, including changes during the year, are included below.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Interests in equity-accounted investees The Groups interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in joint ventures and associates.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, and where the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
They are initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The Group applied for the first time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 81 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below.
Although these new standards and amendments applied for the first time in 2016, they did not have a material impact on the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The nature and the impact of each new standard or amendment are described below: i Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IFRS The amendments require business combination accounting to be applied to acquisitions of interests in a joint operation that constitutes a business.
The Group did not entered into such transactions during the year and thus this amendment did not impact the Groups financial statements.
ii Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle This cycle of improvements contains amendments to the following four standards: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations Changes in method for disposal IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Continuing involvement for servicing contracts Offsetting disclosures in condensed interim financial statements IAS 19 Employee Benefits Discount rate in a regional market sharing the same currency IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting Disclosure of information elsewhere in the interim financial report The Group has applied these improvements during the year.
2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies Except for the changes explained in Note 2.2, the Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
A Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and identifiable net assets acquired are measured at the acquisition date fair value.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at that date through the income statement.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Groups net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and is allocated to each of the Groups hotels that are expected to benefit from the combination.
If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
82 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information B Foreign currency The financial statements of each of the Groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
i Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to the income statement.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of related hedges are taken to translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.
C Derivative financial instruments The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if certain criteria are met.
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value: any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.
D Hedges i Cash flow hedges When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the above policy, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities When a derivative financial instrument is used as an economic hedge of the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, hedge accounting is not applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 83 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity within the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
E Property, plant and equipment and depreciation i Recognition and measurement Land and buildings other than investment properties are stated at cost, except as allowed under IFRS 1 transition rules, less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Any impairment of such properties below depreciated historical cost is charged to the income statement.
Under the transition provisions of IFRS 1, land and buildings which were previously revalued under UK GAAP were measured on the basis of their deemed cost, being their UK GAAP carrying value, including revaluations, as at 1 January 2004 being the effective date of the Groups conversion to IFRS.
ii Depreciation Freehold land is not depreciated.
All other assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Building core 50 years or lease term if shorter Building surface, finishes and services 30 years or lease term if shorter Plant and machinery 15 20 years Furniture and equipment 10 years Soft furnishings 5 7 years Computer equipment 5 years Software up to 8 years Motor vehicles 4 years No residual values are ascribed to building surface finishes and services.
Residual values ascribed to building core depend on the nature, location and tenure of each property.
iii Subsequent costs Capital expenditure on major projects is recorded separately within property, plant and equipment as capital work in progress.
Once the project is complete the balance is transferred to the appropriate fixed asset categories.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Interest attributable to funds used to finance the construction or acquisition of new hotels or major extensions to existing hotels is capitalised net of tax relief and added to the cost of the hotel core.
Operating supplies, which include china, linen, glass and silverware, were stated at their deemed costs as at 1 January 2008 and subsumed into the costs of the hotel buildings.
Subsequent renewals and replacements of such stocks and new supplies upon initial hotel opening are written off as incurred to the income statement.
F Leases i Leased assets Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The leased asset is initially recorded at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments.
The equivalent liability, categorised as appropriate, is included within current or non-current liabilities.
Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease to produce constant rates of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable by the Group under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on the same basis.
In cases where rents comprise a fixed and a variable element, the fixed element only is charged to the 84 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information income statement on a straight-line basis with the variable amounts being charged as they become due.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Rentals receivable by the Group as lessor under operating leases, including the sub-letting of retail outlets within hotel properties, are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if the receipts are not made on such a basis.
Costs, including depreciation incurred in earning the lease income, are recognised as an expense.
ii Lease premium The Group makes and receives initial payments on entering into both long and short leases of land and buildings.
Where payment for leased land is equivalent to the purchase of the freehold interest, the lease is classified as a finance lease.
All other payments for leases of land are classified as operating leases.
On the statement of financial position, finance lease payment attributable to the land is recorded as property, plant and equipment and for operating leases, the land is recorded as a lease premium prepayment.
Both lease types are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest attributable to funds to finance the purchase or lease of land is capitalised gross of tax relief and added to the cost of lease.
In the case of lease premiums received, these are reflected on the statement of financial position as deferred income, appropriately classified between current and non-current liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
G Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than investment properties, inventories, employee benefit assets and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Where permissible under IFRS, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in fair value of the asset below its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
H Investment properties Investment properties held by the Group are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are stated at fair value.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value on annual revaluation is recognised in the income statement in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
In limited circumstances, the determination of fair value is uncertain, and these properties are carried at cost.
Impairment analysis over these properties is carried out annually.
An external independent valuer, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued, values the portfolio annually.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
I Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 85 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued J Development properties Development properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
They are held for sale in the short term and are therefore classified as current assets.
The cost of development properties includes interest and other related expenditure incurred in order to get the asset ready for its intended use.
Borrowing costs payable on loans funding a development property are also capitalised, on a specific identification basis, as part of the cost of the development property until the completion of development.
Payments received from purchasers arising from pre-sales of the property units prior to the completion are included as deferred income under other financial liabilities in the statement of financial position.
K Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
L Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
M Income tax Income tax on profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: i the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and ii differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only to the extent that: i the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities: ii the Group intends to settle net: and iii the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
N Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
ii Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement.
The Group recognises remeasurement gains and losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
86 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liabilities asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the income statement.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than post-employment plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The share-based incentive schemes allow the Groups employees to acquire shares of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees for awards granted after 7 November 2002 is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in Note 23.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
All cancellations of equitysettled transaction awards are treated equally.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share further details are given in Note 11.
O Provisions A provision is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Further details on provisions are given in Note 24.
P Revenue and its recognition Revenue comprises: Income from the ownership and operation of hotels recognised at the point at which the accommodation and related services are provided: Management fees earned from hotels managed by the Group, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.
Management fees include a base fee, which is generally a percentage of hotel revenue, and or an incentive fee, which is generally based on the hotels profitability: recognised when earned on an accrual basis under the terms of the contract: Franchise fees received in connection with licensing of the Groups brand names, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.
The Group charges franchise royalty fees as a percentage of room revenue: recognised when earned on an accrual basis under the terms of the agreement: Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 87 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Income from property rental recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income: and Development property sales recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, which is usually when legal title transfers depending on jurisdictions.
The trigger for revenue recognition depends on the laws within each jurisdiction.
Q Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
R Operating segment information Disclosure of segmental information is principally presented in respect of the Groups geographical segments.
The segments reported reflect the operating information included in internal reports that the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, which is the Board, regularly reviews.
Further details are given in Note 5.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
Discrete financial information is reported to and is reviewed by the CODM on a geographical basis.
Operating segments have Chief Operating Officers COOs or equivalent who are directly accountable for the functioning of their segments and maintain regular contact with the Group Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the CODM to discuss the operational and financial performance.
The CODM makes decisions about allocation of resources to the regions managed by the COOs.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable operating segments.
Segment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items principally comprise interest-bearing loans, borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, net finance expense, taxation balances and corporate expenses.
S Non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held-for-sale.
Generally the assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to property, plant and equipment and lease premium prepayment, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
T Other financial assets and liabilities Trade investments are classified as available-for-sale assets and are included under non-current assets within other financial assets.
They are recorded at market value with movements in value taken to equity.
Any impairment to value is recorded in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material less any impairment.
Trade and other payables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material.
U Related parties For the purpose of these financial statements, parties are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Group and the party are subject to common control or common significant influence.
Related parties may be individuals or other entities.
3 Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit & Risk Committee the selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year.
The Group evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Such estimates and judgements are based upon historical experience and other factors it believes 88 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Certain critical accounting policies, among others, affect the Groups more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results could differ from the Groups estimates and assumptions.
Key estimates and judgements have been made in the following areas, of which the most significant are listed first: Asset carrying values Management performs an assessment at each balance sheet date of assets across the Group where risk of impairment has been identified.
Key judgement areas include the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and investment properties, investment in and loans to joint ventures and associates, and development properties.
The recovery of these assets is dependent on future cash flows being receivable and the provision of future services or goods by third parties.
Where risk of impairment has been identified an impairment review has been performed on property, plant and equipment, lease premium prepayments and investments in and loans to joint ventures and associates held across the Group on a cash generating basis.
Where appropriate, external evaluations are also undertaken.
The impairment review is performed on a value in use basis which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and appropriate growth rates.
The discount rates used reflect appropriate sensitivities involved in the assessment.
Discount rates used for impaired properties and investment properties are disclosed in Notes 12 and 14.
Investment properties The Group holds a number of investment properties and accounts for such properties in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.3H.
The Group owns assets which are leased to external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to the agreement involved.
The Group accounts for such assets in its financial statements in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.3H.
Where the indicators are such that on balance the Group is shown to be a passive investor, the relevant property is accounted for in accordance with IAS 40 and the Group accounts for the fair value change through the income statement as other operating income or expense.
Indicators considered include 1 party that has the power to make the significant operating and financing decisions regarding the operations of the property in a management contract, 2 calculation of the lessors return, 3 lessors power of intervention under the management contract, and 4 duration of the contract.
Consolidation of entities in which the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights fide facto control In 2014, the new consolidation accounting standard, IFRS 10 introduced a new control model that focuses on whether the Group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns.
This required the Group to consider whether it has fide facto control over its investees, particularly when it owned less than 50% of the voting rights.
In 2014, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 10, the Group reassessed the control conclusion for its investees and changed its control conclusion in respect of its investment in CDL Hospitality Trusts CDLHT, which was previously accounted for as an associate using the equity method.
Although the Group owns less than half of the voting power of the investee, management determined that, under IFRS 10, the Group has had control over the investee since its inception.
This is because a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group, M&C REIT Management Limited acts as REIT Manager with its fees having a performance-based element and therefore the Group has exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee.
Accordingly, in 2014, the Group applied acquisition accounting to the investment from the year it was first established in 2006, and restated the relevant amounts as if the investee had been consolidated from that year.
This judgement was reconsidered this year and continues to be appropriate.
Business combination For each acquisition, the Group has to make a judgement whether to account the transaction as an asset purchase or a business combination, which results in a different accounting treatment.
In particular, under business combination accounting, goodwill and additional intangible assets may arise and the valuation of acquired assets is complex.
In addition, transaction costs can be capitalised in an asset acquisition, but have to be charged through the income statement for a business combination.
The classification of each acquisition and related accounting is highly judgemental.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 89 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Taxation The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement, particularly when tax treatment for certain items cannot be determined until a final resolution.
In addition, recognition of deferred tax assets is judgemental as it depends on expected timing and level of future taxable income.
Provisions for tax accruals require judgements on the interpretation of tax legislation, developments in tax case law and the potential outcomes of tax audits and appeals.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material income statement and or cash flow variances.
Land leases classification The Group holds a number of hotels with leases of land that are determined to have an indefinite economic life.
These are classified as a finance lease, even if at the end of the lease term title does not pass to the lessee.
In determining whether the lease of land should be accounted for as a finance or an operating lease, the following factors were considered: transfer of ownership purchase options present value of minimum lease payments in comparison to fair value of land.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 30.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report Financial performance on pages 10 to 11 and in the key performance indicators on page 9.
In addition, Note 22 of the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and plans for refinancing maturing facilities are under way.
Cash flow forecasts for the Group have been prepared for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements.
These forecasts reflect an assessment of current market conditions.
The forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the financial covenants.
In addition, management has considered various mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that market conditions are worse than their current assessment.
Such measures include further reduction in costs and in capital expenditure.
On the basis of the exercise as described above and the available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the signing of this annual report.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
In assessing whether the Group is a going concern, the Directors follow a review process which is consistent with the principles set out in the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting 2014 published by the Financial Reporting Council.
Defined benefit pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans.
As set out in Note 23, the calculation of the present value of the Groups defined benefit obligations at each period end is subject to significant estimation.
An appropriately qualified, independent actuary is used to undertake this calculation.
The assumptions made by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The valuation of scheme assets is based on their fair value at the balance sheet date.
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short term, their values may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
In reviewing the work of the independent actuary, management is required to exercise judgement to satisfy themselves that appropriate weight has been afforded to macro economic factors.
Details of the assumptions used are set out in Note 23.
Measurement of fair values A number of the Groups accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non financial liabilities.
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values.
Management reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuations adjustments.
If third party information is used to measure fair values, then management assesses the evidence obtained from third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in their fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.
Significant valuation issues are reported to the Group Audit & Risk Committee.
90 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information When measuring fair values, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuations techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices led in Level 1 that are observable for an asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for an asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in Note 14 Investment Properties and Note 23 Employee Benefits.
4 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB, become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IFRIC Effective date IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and measurement 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from implementation of these standards.
5 Operating segment information Disclosure of segmental information is principally presented in respect of the Groups geographical segments.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items principally comprise: interest-bearing loans, borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, net financial expense, taxation balances and corporate expenses.
Geographical segments The hotel and property operations are managed on a worldwide basis and operate in seven principal geographical areas as follows: New York Regional US London Rest of Europe including the Middle East Singapore Rest of Asia Australasia The segments reported reflect the operating segment information included in the internal reports that the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, which is the Board, regularly reviews.
The reportable segments are aligned with the structure of the Groups internal organisation which is based according to geographical region.
Operating segments have Chief Operating Officers COOs or equivalent who are directly accountable for the functioning of their segments and who maintain regular contact with the Group Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the CODM to discuss the operational and financial performance.
The results of CDLHT have been incorporated within the existing geographical regions.
In addition, CDLHT operations are reviewed separately by its board on a monthly basis.

a Revaluation gain deficit of investment properties At the end of the financial year, in accordance with the Groups policy its investment properties were subject to external professional valuation on an open-market existing use basis.
Based on these valuations, the revaluation gain or deficit was recorded as considered appropriate by the Directors.
Further details on these valuations are provided in Note 14. b Impairment The Directors undertook their annual review of the carrying value of hotels and property assets for indication of impairment and where appropriate, external valuations were also obtained.
As a result of this review, the total impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 24m consisting of 15m in New York, 5m in Rest of Europe, 2m in Rest of Asia and 2m for Regional US.
For 2015, a total impairment charge of 76m was recognised in relation to 23m in New York, 15m in Rest of Europe, 37m in Rest of Asia and 1m for New Zealand.

The effective tax rate has been affected by a number of factors which include the following items: Other income and expense of the Group: Reduced tax rates applied to brought forward net deferred tax liabilities in the UK: and Tax adjustments in respect of previous years.
Excluding the impact of the items noted above, the Groups underlying effective tax rate is 15.4% 2015: 18.4%.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, a charge of 3m 2015: 6m relating to joint ventures and associates is included in the profit before tax.
With regard to the UK, a reduction to 17% in the rate applicable from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted during the year.
This has reduced the deferred tax liability as at 31 December 2016.
Adjustments in respect of settlement of prior years tax liabilities The Groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The geographical complexity of the Groups structure makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and it is often dependent on the efficacy of the legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

100 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information a Impairment Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating unit CGU.
The CGUs are individual hotels.
The carrying value of individual hotels was compared to the recoverable amount of the hotels, which was predominantly based on value-in-use.
For 2016, where indicators of impairment were present, the Group estimated value-in-use through creation of discounted cash flow models, based on future trading performance expected by management.
The underlying basis for the impairment model involves each hotels projected cash flow for the financial year ending 31 December 2017, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions in respect of revenue growth principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth and major expense lines.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area, as well as internal business plans.
These plans and forecasts include managements most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market.
The forecasts cover a five to ten year period, and cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate ranging between 2% and 3%, which is based upon the expected trading growth for each hotel and inflation in the country.
Where appropriate, the Directors sought guidance on value from a registered independent appraiser with an appropriately recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the hotel being valued.
On the basis of external valuations in 2016, the Group recorded an impairment charge of 28m including the impairment of a REIT property of 4m consisting of 15m in relation to a New York hotel, 2m for a hotel in Regional US, 5m for three hotels in Rest of Europe and 6m for two hotels in Rest of Asia.
For 2015, a total impairment charge of 76m was recognised in relation to 23m in relation to a New York hotel, 15m for three hotels in Rest of Europe, 37m for two hotels in Rest of Asia and 1m for a hotel in New Zealand.
This reflected the challenging trading conditions in those regions.
Circumstances and events that led to the impairment are disclosed in the Financial Performance review on page 10. b Key assumptions used by the external appraisers The key assumptions used were as follows: Pre-tax discount rate The discount rate is based on the country in which the hotel is located and is adjusted for risks associated with the hotel.
Discount rates ranged from 8% to 12% in the US, 7% to 11% in Europe and 8% to 9% in Asia.
Occupancy rate The occupancy growth rates ranged from 0% to 7% in the US, 0% to 8% in Europe and 0% to 3% in Asia.
Average room rate The average room rate growth ranged from 0% to 5% in the US, 0% to 9% in Europe and 0% to 8% in Asia.
c Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and revenue growth assumptions.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonably possible change in a single factor could result in impairment in certain hotels in London, Regional UK, Regional US, Asia and Australasia as their fair value currently exceeds their carrying value only by a small percentage.
d Land and buildings Land and buildings includes long leasehold building assets with a book value of 645m 2015: 606m.
The net book value of land and buildings held under short leases was 109m 2015: 96m, in respect of which depreciation of 2m 2015: 2m was charged during the year.
No interest was capitalised within land and buildings during the year 2015: nil.
The cumulative capitalised interest within land and buildings is 5m 2015: 5m.
e Pledged assets At year-end, the net book value of assets pledged as collateral for secured loans was 526m 2015: 263m.
The security for the loans is by way of charges on the properties of the Group companies concerned.

Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 107 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: and market risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, with credit checks performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through consultation with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current creditworthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.
Investments are allowed only in liquid short-term instruments within approved limits, with investment counterparties approved by the Board, such that the exposure to a single counterparty is minimised.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset on the balance sheet, these being spread across the various currencies and jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying value 2016 2015 m m Cash at bank and in hand see Note 20 223 235 Short-term deposits see Note 20 194 118 Trade receivables see Note 19 39 35 Other receivables see Note 19 27 23 483 411 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying value 2016 2015 m m New York 6 5 Regional US 4 3 Rest of Europe 7 7 Singapore 8 7 Rest of Asia 8 10 Australasia 6 3 39 35 108 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross receivable Impairment allowance Carrying value 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m m m Not past due 21 22 21 22 Past due 0 30 days 10 4 10 4 Past due 31 60 days 3 3 3 3 Past due 61 90 days 3 2 3 2 More than 90 days 4 6 2 2 2 4 41 37 2 2 39 35 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2016 2015 m m Balance at 1 January 2 2 Impairment released Balance at 31 December 2 2 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 109 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Contractual maturities of financial assets 2016 6 months 6 months 1 - 5 More than Total or less - 1 year years 5 years m m m m m Financial Assets Fixed Rate Sterling 24 24 US dollar 24 24 Korean Won 5 5 Singapore dollar 87 87 New Taiwan dollar 12 12 Australian dollar 4 4 New Zealand dollar 55 55 Malaysian Ringgit 15 15 Euro 3 3 Chinese Renminbi 17 17 Non Interest Bearing Sterling 21 21 US dollar 22 22 Singapore dollar 21 21 Malaysian Ringgit 1 1 Euro 14 14 Japanese Yen 11 11 Others 11 11 Interest Bearing Cash Pool deposits Singapore dollar 70 70 Total cash and other financial assets 417 417 Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 33 33 Euro 6 6 Hong Kong dollar 28 28 Non Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 13 13 Total overdrafts Note 20 80 80 337 337 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents Note 20 337 337 110 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Contractual maturities of financial assets 2015 6 months 6 months 1 - 5 More than Total or less - 1 year years 5 years m m m m m Financial Assets Fixed Rate US dollar 14 14 Korean Won 2 2 Singapore dollar 37 37 New Taiwan dollar 8 8 Australian dollar 7 7 New Zealand dollar 36 36 Malaysian Ringgit 11 11 Euro 11 11 Chinese Renminbi 15 15 Non Interest Bearing Sterling 39 39 US dollar 36 36 Singapore dollar 21 21 Malaysian Ringgit 1 1 Euro 4 4 Japanese 12 12 Other 8 8 Interest Bearing Cash Pool deposits Singapore dollar 91 91 Total cash and other financial assets 353 353 Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 33 33 Euro 5 5 Japanese Yen 13 13 Hong Kong dollar 28 28 Non Interest Bearing Cash Pool Overdrafts Sterling 28 28 Japanese Yen 8 8 Total overdrafts Note 20 115 115 238 238 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents Note 20 238 238 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 111 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments using the interest rates prevailing as at the reporting date.

Plans for refinancing the facilities are underway.
c Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below.
i Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective Group entities.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, New Taiwan dollars, Korean won, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen and Euro.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets are designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
Net investment hedging The Group has US$162m 2015: US$167m US dollar loans and overdrafts, 61m 2015: 61m Euro loans and overdrafts, and JPYnil 2015: JPY3,704m Japanese yen overdrafts designated as hedges of corresponding respective proportions of its net investment in foreign operations whose functional currencies are US dollars, Euros and Japanese yen.
The risk being hedged is the foreign currency exposure on the carrying amount of the net assets of the foreign operation upon consolidation.
The fair value of the hedging instruments as at 31 December 2016 was 188m 2015: 178m.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement that arose from hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 113 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued An analysis of borrowings by currency and their fair values as at 31 December is given below: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Sterling 66 66 64 64 Singapore dollar 240 240 199 199 Australia dollar 55 55 46 46 US dollar 415 415 303 303 New Zealand dollar 37 37 34 34 Chinese renminbi 34 34 33 33 Japanese yen 117 117 94 94 New Taiwan dollar 11 11 10 10 Korean Won 23 23 20 20 Euro 46 46 40 40 1,044 1,044 843 843 Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short-term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate.
There are no foreign exchange derivatives in place at 31 December 2016.

ii Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floating rates presently as this flexibility is considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Groups consolidated statement of financial position.
Further details of interest rate derivatives in place at 31 December 2016 are provided hereafter.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a change of one percentage point in the average interest rates applicable to variable rate instruments for the year would have increased decreased the Groups profit before tax for the year as shown below: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 1% increase 1% decrease 1% increase 1% decrease m m m m Variable rate financial assets 2 2 2 2 Variable rate financial liabilities 11 11 9 9 Cash flow sensitivity net 9 9 7 7 d Fair value Set out below is a comparison of the fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments by category.
Fair values are determined by reference to market values, where available, or calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
116 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Fair value hierarchy As at 31 December 2016, the Group held certain financial instruments measured at fair value.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques that use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value m m m m Investment properties 525 525 525 525 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value m m m m Investment properties 499 499 499 499 During the year ended 31 December 2016 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measures.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Companys objective for managing its capital is to ensure that Group entities will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders, as well as sustaining the future development of its business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may alter the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, draw down additional debt or reduce debt.
The Groups capital structure consists of debt, which includes the loans and borrowings disclosed in Note 21, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in Note 20 and the equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
One of the Groups subsidiaries, CDLHT which is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust H-REIT and CDL Hospitality Business Trust HBT, a business trust, is required to maintain certain minimum base capital and financial resources.
H-REIT is subject to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Property Fund Appendix of the Code on Collective Investment Schemes CIS Code issued by Monetary Authority of Singapore.
The CIS Code stipulates that the total borrowings and deferred payments together the Aggregate Leverage of a property fund should not exceed 35.0% of its Deposited Property except that the Aggregate Leverage of a property fund may exceed 35.0% of its Deposited Property up to a maximum of 60.0% if a credit rating of the property fund from Fitch Inc. Moodys or Standard and Poors is obtained and disclosed to the public.
The property fund should continue to maintain and disclose a credit rating so long as its Aggregate Leverage exceeds 35.0% of its Deposited Property.
For this financial year, H-REIT has a credit rating of BBBfrom Fitch Inc.
The Aggregate Leverage of H-REIT as at 31 December 2016 was 36.8% 2015: 36.4% of H-REITs Deposited Property.
This complied with the aggregate leverage limit as described above.
HBT, H-REIT and CDLHT have complied with the borrowing limit requirements imposed by the relevant Trust Deeds and all externally imposed capital requirements for the financial years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015.
Except for the above, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 117 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Employee benefits Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most significant funds are described below.
United Kingdom The pension arrangements in the United Kingdom operate under the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan, which was set up in 1993.
The plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan, both with different categories of membership.
The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time rights to a guaranteed minimum pension GMP under the defined contribution scheme also ceased.
The plan entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2014 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2016.
The contributions of the Group during the year were 24% 2015: 24% of pensionable salary.
As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
South Korea The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in South Korea.

Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.
The contributions of the Group were 6% 2015: 6% of the employees earnings.
The defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group.
The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.
These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
The above plans are substantially funded by the Groups subsidiaries.
The funding requirements are based on the pension funds actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 UK South Korea Taiwan UK South Korea Taiwan Inflation rate 3.5% 3.0% 3.2% 3.0% Discount rate 2.7% 2.8% 1.0% 3.6% 2.8% 1.6% Rate of salary increase 4.0% 4.0% 3.0% 3.7% 4.0% 3.0% Rate of pension increases 3.5% 3.2% Rate of revaluation 2.5% 2.2% Annual expected return on plan assets 2.7% 2.8% 1.0% 3.6% 2.8% 1.6% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
