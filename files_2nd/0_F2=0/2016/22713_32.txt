ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 1.5 Financial instruments Fair value measurement of financial instruments The Company has adopted IAS 39 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments.
Financial assets Financial assets which primarily represent loans to subsidiary companies and cash are initially recognised at fair value.
Borrowings Interestbearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the instrument.
Finance costs associated with each individual drawdown are expensed over the period of that drawdown.
Borrowings are classified as noncurrent liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability until the end of the term ofthe agreement.
Further details of the Companys bank loans can be found in Note 23 of the Group financial statements.
1.6 Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
1.7 Taxation Current taxation Income tax for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible.
TheGroups liability for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
1.8 Dividend Dividend distributions to Countryside Properties PLC shareholders are recognised in the Companys financial statements in the periods in which the final dividends are approved in the annual general meeting, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, from the proceeds.
1.10 Related parties The Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned within the same Group.
Where appropriate, transactions of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the transactions on the Group financial statements.
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have had significant impact upon the financial information, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
This approach forms the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value ofassets and liabilities are described below.
IPO costs As permitted by section 610 2b of the Companies Act 2006, 4.6m of transaction costs in relation to the Groups IPO were offset against the share premium of 293.6m created on the issue of new ordinary shares.
Management has exercised judgement inassessing the allocation of costs incurred between share premium and the current period income statement.
Impairment of fixed asset investments Determining whether fixed asset investments are impaired requires judgement and estimation.
The Directors periodically review fixed asset investments forpossible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgement, that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Such indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology and expectations offuture operating losses or negative cash flows.
The Company did not record any impairment charges during the period ended 30 September 2016.
