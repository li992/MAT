Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The difference between initial fair value and the redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
177 Financial Statements Notes to the ITV plc Company Financial Statements continued Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the profit and loss account within net financing costs, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of cash flow hedge is recognised in retained profits within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the profit and loss account in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Companys derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss the fair value change and interest income expense are not separated.
Deferred tax The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement or directly in equity according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore involves judgement regarding timing and level of future taxable income.
Share-based compensation The Company utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award DSA, Performance Share Plan PSP, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Save As You Earn SAYE schemes.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Company receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
If the Company incurs a liability based on the price or value of the shares then this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
The Company recognises the retained earnings impact of the share-based compensation for the Group as awards are settled in ITV plc shares.
The cost of providing those awards is recharged to subsidiaries that receive the service from employees.
The fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions.
For performance-based schemes, the relevant performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order to determine the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate is then used to determine the option fair value, discounted to present value.
The Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, are recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new shares.
No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA.
During the year all exercises were satisfied by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees Benefit Trust.
Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date.
Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate or vice-versa or one type of floating interest rate for another and are used to manage interest rate risk.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps are derivative instruments used to exchange the principal and interest coupons in a debt instrument from one currency to another.
Cash flow hedges The Group applies hedge accounting for certain foreign currency firm commitments and highly probably cash flows where the underlying cash flows are payable within the next two to seven years.
In order to fix the sterling cash inflows and outflows associated with the commitments and interest payments which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest swaps for the same foreign currency amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow.
On issuing the 2023 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfolio of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which swapped the euro principal and fixed rate coupons into sterling.
In result the Group makes sterling interest payments at a fixed rate.
