An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 24 December 2016 26 December 2015 m m Balance at start of period 8.3 7.3 Increase in allowance recognised in the income statement 0.4 1.0 Balance at end of period 8.7 8.3 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 26.
We have no significant concentration of credit risk, as our exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
We charge interest at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, we obtain a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then we set credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
We review credit limits regularly, and adjust them if circumstances change.
In the case of one-off customers, our policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report 102 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result we consider the credit quality of period end trade receivables to be high.
We regularly review trade receivables which are past due but not impaired, and we consider, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable.
We maintain regular contact with all such customers and, where necessary, we take legal action to recover the receivable.
We make an allowance for impairment for any specific amounts which we consider to be irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
We also have a separate general allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales and is based on historical default rates.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 8.7m 2015: 8.3m consists of a specific provision of 3.5m 2015: 3.3m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 4.5m 2015: 4.2m, and a general provision of 5.2m 2015: 5.0m.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, we have recorded impairment charges in the consolidated income statement and have written carrying values down to their estimated recoverable amounts.
We wrote off 5.0m of debts in the period 2015: 4.7m.
Included within our aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 18.9m before bad debt provision 2015: 19.4m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
We have assessed these balances for recoverability and we believe that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is as follows: 24 December 2016 26 December 2015 m m 130 days past due 9.3 10.5 3160 days past due 2.2 1.9 6190 days past due 1.1 1.3 90 days past due 6.3 5.7 Total overdue amounts, excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 18.9 19.4 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short-term deposit, and is available on demand.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in short-term UK Gilts.
They have maturity dates ranging between 1 and 3 months from the balance sheet date.
They return a fixed rate of interest.
The weighted average effective interest rate on the Gilts held at the balance sheet date is 0.1% pa.
These investments are classified as held-to-maturity, and are held at amortised cost.
The Directors estimate that the fair value of these investments at the current period end is equal to their carrying value.
Assets pledged as security In the event that the Group were to use its bank facility, it has pledged its trade receivables as security for any borrowing under the facility.
