The expected rate is the weighted average rate taking into account the Groups profits in these jurisdictions.
The expected rate has decreased in 2016 due to the change in mix of the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The tax charge for the year is higher 2015: lower than the expected tax charge due to the following factors: 2016 2015 $m $m Profit before taxation from continuing operations excluding profits from and impairment of joint ventures 119.3 249.2 Profit before taxation from discontinued operations - 10.4 Total profit before taxation 119.3 259.6 Profit before tax at expected rate of 24.7% 2015: 25.4% 29.5 65.9 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior years 6.2 13.5 Non-recognition of losses and other attributes 10.0 12.6 Effect of foreign taxes 8.0 9.1 Other permanent differences 9.7 15.2 Total tax charge 31.6 58.9 Other permanent differences include adjustments for share based charges, research and development allowances, changes in unrecognised tax attributes and expenditure which is not tax deductible.
Tax losses are recognised where there is reasonable certainty that they can be utilised in future years.
Net income tax liabilities in the Group balance sheet include $101.0m relating to uncertain tax positions where management has had to exercise judgement in determining the most likely outcome in respect of the relevant issue.
The larger amounts relate to tax payable in relation to divestments $27.9m, recoverability of withholding taxes $25.3m, and utilisation of tax losses $11.8m.
Where the final outcome on these issues differs to the amounts provided, the Groups tax charge will be impacted.
Where corporate tax assets and liabilities are in the same jurisdictions, amounts are netted in the Group balance sheet.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to owners of the parent divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Groups employee share trusts.
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Groups dilutive ordinary shares comprise share options granted to employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Retention Plan, shares and share options awarded under the Groups Long Term Plan and shares awarded under the Groups Employee Share Plan.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are disclosed to show the results excluding the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax.
The impairment tests were carried out by Cash Generating Unit CGU.
Following the change to a service defined structure during the year, the Group has updated its CGUs accordingly and now has three CGUs, Asset Life Cycle Solutions East ALCS East, Asset Life Cycle Solutions West ALCS West and Specialist Technical Solutions STS.
These replace the seven CGUs that existed previously, comprising WG Mustang, WG Kenny and WG PSN which was split into five regional CGUs.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 91 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash flow projections included in the financial budgets prepared by management and approved by the Board for 2017 and 2018.
The budgets are based on various assumptions including market outlook, resource utilisation, contract backlog, contract margins and assumed contract awards.
Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for ALCS East and STS and 2% for ALCS West for a further three year period.
A terminal value is applied thereafter in order to calculate long term estimated cash flows using the same anticipated growth rates.
The growth rates used do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates appropriate for each CGU, 12.1% for ALCS East, 12.0% for ALCS West and 12.8% for STS the equivalent post-tax rates are 10.5%, 10.25% and 11.0% respectively.
The carrying value of the goodwill for each CGU is shown in the table below.
No goodwill has been written off during the current or prior year.
Cash Generating Unit Goodwill carrying value $m ALCS East 782.0 ALCS West 773.7 STS 149.5 A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long term growth rate falls by 1% and that the discount rates are 1% higher than those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
This analysis did not identify any impairment.
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations.
As part of the impairment review, the Group has reviewed these contracts and relationships and no impairment was identified.
Amounts reclassified to PP&E in the period relate to expenditure initially recorded in current assets and subsequently capitalised when the assets were available for use.

Trading for the joint venture continued to be challenging in 2016 and management have carried out an impairment review at 31 December 2016.
The recoverable amount is supported by third party market data.
EthosEnergy has also recorded impairment losses of $29.9m Wood Group share relating to the restructuring of its major maintenance business, closure of its power solutions business and the write down of engines and turbine parts.
The charge is reflected in the exceptional expense line in the table above.
In arriving at the post impairment carrying value of EthosEnergy, the directors have calculated a value in use based on the Groups share of the joint ventures future expected cash flows.
These have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 14.7%, which is higher than the Groups weighted average cost of capital to reflect the risks inherent in this business, and the discounted value has been compared to the carrying value of the investment.
In calculating the value in use, management has assumed modest future revenue growth of 2.5%, margins remaining below those achieved by the continuing business in 2016, overheads remaining flat and some modest working capital outflows.
If the assumptions used in the value in use calculation are not met then a further impairment may require to be recorded in future periods.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the basis that the expected long term growth rate falls by 1% and the discount rate is increased by 1% in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
The sensitivity analysis showed that a 1% reduction in the terminal growth rate would have resulted in an additional impairment of $7.4m and a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an additional impairment of $10.4m.
A further sensitivity calculation was performed assuming a 10% reduction in revenue each year from 2017-2021, slightly reduced gross profit margins due to the impact of a partial fixed cost base, overheads at a fixed percentage of revenue and working capital inflows as a result of declining activity.
This calculation resulted in an additional impairment of $16.0m.
The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, nor has the Group any significant contingent liabilities in relation to its interest in the joint ventures.

17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups BUs identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geopolitical uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in equity.
The Group does not have any financial instruments in place to hedge foreign currency movements in its balance sheet.
However, strategies such as payment of intercompany dividends are used to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
100 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued The Groups largest foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
The potential impact of changes in the sterling US dollar exchange rate is summarised in the table below.
As the Group reports in US dollars a weakening of the pound has a negative impact on translation of its sterling companies profits and net assets.
2016 2015 $m $m Impact of 10% change to average $ exchange rate on profit after tax 2.4 6.0 Impact of 10% change to closing $ exchange rate on equity 67.1 75.2 10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
The Group also has foreign exchange risk in relation a number of other currencies, in particular, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Norwegian kroner.
ii Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and debt.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at a mixture of fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2016, 53% 2015: 42% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits and where possible, deposit cash with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better.
If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2016 2015: 1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $0.7m lower or higher respectively 2015: $0.2m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
Responsibility for managing credit risk lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A new Group credit risk policy was introduced during 2016 in order to enhance and improve existing controls.
There remains significant management focus on customers that are classified as high risk in the current challenging market although in 2016 the Group had only minimal write offs.
Where required, a customer evaluation is obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency and an assessment of credit risk is carried out for all material customers.
Appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance are used to manage credit risk where appropriate.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
c Liquidity risk With regard to liquidity, the Groups main priority is to ensure continuity of funding.
At 31 December 2016, 100% 2015: 100% of the Groups long term borrowings including senior loan notes were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
The Group has $375m of unsecured senior loan notes issued in the US private placement market.
The notes have a mix of 7, 10 and 12 year maturities.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 101 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
These ratios are calculated using the proportionally consolidated figures used for management reporting.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing total EBITA by net finance expense.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2016 was 14.1 times 2015: 20.3 times.
The ratio of net debt to total EBITDA at 31 December 2016 was 0.79 2015: 0.55.
Financial liabilities The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Drawdowns under the bilateral bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and therefore loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Drawdowns under long term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
There are three valuation methods used to fair value financial instruments as follows X Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 X Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 2 X Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs Level 3 Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.
102 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 17 Financial instruments continued Deferred and contingent consideration Deferred and contingent consideration is payable on the acquisition of businesses based on earn out arrangements and is initially recognised at fair value.
The amount payable is dependent on the post-acquisition profits of the acquired entities and the provision made is based on the Groups estimate of the likely profits of those entities based on the relevant Acquisition Approval Paper submitted to the Group Board.
Where actual profits are higher or lower than the Groups estimate and the amount of contingent consideration payable is consequently different to the amount estimated then the variance is charged or credited to the income statement.
Where deferred and contingent consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
The fair value of contingent consideration is not based on observable market data and as such the valuation method is classified as level 3 as per above.
The process for valuation is consistently applied to all acquisitions.
The table below presents the changes in level 3 financial instruments during the year: Contingent consideration arising from business combinations $m At 1 January 99.6 Exchange movements 3.8 Amounts provided in relation to new acquisitions 8.2 Interest relating to discounting of contingent consideration 2.6 Payments during the year 1.0 Amounts released to the income statement 12.9 At 31 December 92.7 18 Provisions Warranty Other provisions provisions Total $m $m $m At 1 January 2016 28.0 66.8 94.8 Exchange movements 1.3 5.8 7.1 Charge to income statement - 16.6 16.6 Released to income statement 14.0 19.7 33.7 At 31 December 2016 12.7 57.9 70.6 Warranty provisions These provisions are recognised in respect of guarantees provided in the normal course of business relating to contract performance.
They are based on previous claims history and it is expected that most of the costs in respect of these provisions will be incurred over the next two years.
Other provisions At 31 December 2016, other provisions of $57.9m 2015: $66.8m have been recognised.
This amount includes provisions for onerous leases, provisions for legal claims, including claims in relation to inspection and maintenance services in the US and provisions relating to the divestment of businesses.
It is expected that any payment required in respect of these provisions would be made within the next two years.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 103 Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements 19 Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate applicable to the territory in which the asset or liability has arisen.
The UK rate of corporation tax, currently 20%, will reduce to 19% in April 2017 and 18% in April 2020.
The Group has provided deferred tax in relation to UK companies at 19.5% 2015: 19.5%.

As these earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $164.3m 2015: $140.6m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP, the Long Term Plan LTP and the Employee Share Plan.
The charge to operating profit for these schemes amounted to $10.7m 2015: $12.3m.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below.
ESOS and LTRP For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of 20% for ESOS and 25% for LTRP.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk free rate of return is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
Long Term Plan The Groups Long Term Plan LTP was introduced during 2013.
There are two distinct awards made under the LTP.
Nil value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under the LTRP see above.
In addition, awards to senior management are made based on achievement of performance measures, these being total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Participants may be granted conditional share awards or nil cost options at the start of the cycle.
Performance is measured over a three year period and up to 80% of an award may vest based on the performance over that period.
The vesting of at least 20% of any award is normally deferred for a further period of at least two years.
Performance based awards Details of the LTP awards are set out in the table below.
The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
Further details of the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Cycle 4 5 6 7 8 9 Performance period 2011-13 2012-14 2013-15 2014-16 2015-17 2016-18 Fair value of awards 5.10 6.18 7.53 7.26 5.95 5.82 Type of award Shares options Shares options Options Options Options Options Outstanding at 31 12 16 30,911 94,086 97,773 2,091,395 2,808,245 2,965,298 The awards outstanding under cycles 4, 5 and 6 represent 20% of the award at vesting which is deferred for two years.
Further details on the LTP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Share options A summary of the basis for the charge for ESOS, LTRP and LTP options is set out below together with the number of options granted, exercised and lapsed during the year.
Long Term Retention Plan The following options granted under the Groups LTRP were outstanding at 31 December: Number of ordinary shares under option Exercise price Year of Grant 2016 2015 per share Exercise period 2 2011 - 111,000 4 p 2015-2016 7 2 2012 48,875 459,469 4 p 2016-2017 7 2 2013 433,187 536,517 4 p 2017-2018 7 482,062 1,106,986 Options are granted under the Groups LTRP at par value.
There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of options under the LTRP.
Employee share plan The Group introduced an Employee Share Plan during 2016.
Under the plan employees contribute regular monthly amounts which are used to purchase shares over a one year period.
At the end of the year, the participating employees are awarded one free share for every three shares purchased, providing they remain in employment for a further year.
At 31 December 2016, it is estimated that 195,414 shares will be awarded under the scheme.
There are performance criteria relating to the creation of the pool available but none relating to the exercise of the options.

27 Acquisitions The assets and liabilities acquired in respect of business combinations were as follows: $m Property plant and equipment 1.1 Intangible assets recognised on acquisition 6.4 Other intangible assets 0.1 Trade and other receivables 3.6 Cash and cash equivalents 1.0 Trade and other payables 4.9 Total identifiable net assets acquired 7.3 Goodwill 18.3 Consideration 25.6 Consideration satisfied by: Cash 18.4 Deferred and contingent consideration 7.2 25.6 The Group has used acquisition accounting for the purchases and, in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the goodwill arising on consolidation of $18.3m has been capitalised.
The table reflects payments in respect of deferred and contingent consideration made in relation to acquisitions in prior periods.
In April 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of SVT Holdings Pty Ltd for an initial consideration of $9.1m, net of $1.0m cash acquired.
SVT provides piping and rotating equipment vibration, noise, integrity engineering and asset integrity services to the oil and gas, power, mining and utilities sectors.
SVT, which is based in Perth, Australia is reported in the STS segment.
Also in April, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ingenious Inc for an initial consideration of $3.1m with a further $8.2m of estimated contingent consideration provided.
Ingenious provides proprietary software and consulting services to the global chemical, oil and gas, and energy industries.
Ingenious, which is based in Houston, Texas is reported in the STS segment.
110 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 27 Acquisitions continued Contingent consideration has been provided in relation to the Ingenious acquisition and is payable over the next three years.
The amount payable is dependent on post-acquisition profits and the provision made is based on the Groups estimate of the likely profits of the entity.
Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Neither acquisition is considered material in its own right and amounts have therefore been aggregated in the table above.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups resources to further grow and develop their businesses.
The acquisitions expand the Groups existing service lines and provide increased diversification and entry into new markets.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions.
Intangible assets of $6.4m, representing the fair value of customer contracts and relationships, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in the year.
Trade and other receivables acquired of $3.6m are expected to be recovered in full.
The accounting for these acquisitions will be finalised in the next accounting period.
Acquisition costs incurred in relation to the companies acquired during the year are included in administrative expenses in the income statement.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents in respect of acquisitions is analysed as follows: $m Cash consideration 18.4 Cash acquired 1.0 Cash outflow 17.4 Included in the cash outflow above are contingent consideration payments of $5.2m made during the year in respect of acquisitions made in prior periods.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments were reassessed during the year resulting in the release of $12.9m to the income statement.
Total deferred and contingent consideration outstanding at 31 December amounted to $92.7m 2015: $99.6m.
The results of the Group, as if the above acquisitions had been made at the beginning of period, are presented in the table below.

112 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 29 Retirement benefit scheme surplus deficit The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, and a number of defined contribution plans.
The assets of the defined benefits scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
On 30 June 2014, the scheme was closed to future accrual.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2016 by a professionally qualified actuary.
The Group has agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of 1.7m per annum until 2021, although this is currently under review following the recent actuarial valuation.
At 31 December 2016, there were no active members 2015: nil, 397 pensioners 2015: 370 and 724 deferred members 2015: 774 of the scheme.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2016 2015 % % Discount rate 2.60 3.90 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.55 3.20 Rate of retail price index inflation 3.55 3.20 Rate of consumer price index inflation 2.55 2.20 At 31 December 2016, the mortality assumption used to determine pension liabilities is based on the most recent mortality tables which consider UK wide mortality data relevant to the Groups pension scheme.
The mortality rates are then adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in mortality using up to date projections.
The mortality assumption used a base table of S2NA with CMI 2015 projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.25% pa.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2016 2015 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 246.3 249.7 Fair value of scheme assets 239.3 254.2 Net deficit surplus 7.0 4.5 The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 $m % $m % Equity securities 188.8 78.9 206.9 81.4 Corporate bonds 25.6 10.7 24.9 9.8 Gilts 14.1 5.9 13.2 5.2 Annuity policies 6.0 2.5 6.4 2.5 Cash 4.8 2.0 2.8 1.1 239.3 100.0 254.2 100.0 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2016 2015 $m $m Interest cost 8.8 10.1 Interest income on scheme assets 9.0 9.2 Total included within finance income expense 0.2 0.9 There is no current service cost included in employee benefit expense following the closure of the scheme to future accrual 30 June 2014.

114 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 29 Retirement benefit scheme surplus deficit continued Scheme risks The retirement benefit scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are Volatility The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will create a deficit, all other things being equal.
The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation.
This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding increase in the value of the schemes bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase the defined benefit obligation.
Life expectancy The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members life expectancies will increase the defined benefit obligation, all other things being equal.
Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below.
The sensitivity is based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
Assumption Approximate effect on liabilities Discount rate - Minus 0.5% $26.9m - Plus 0.5% $ 23.4 m Inflation - Plus 0.25% $6.4m - Minus 0.25% $ 6.2 m Life expectancy - Plus 1 year $6.4m - Minus 1 Year $ 6.2 m Defined contribution plans Pension costs for defined contribution plans were as follows: 2016 2015 $m $m Defined contribution plans 68.3 78.8 There were no material contributions outstanding at 31 December 2016 in respect of defined contribution plans.
The Group operates a pension arrangement in the US for certain employees.
During the year, the Group made contributions of $0.6m 2015: $0.8m to the arrangement.
Contributions are invested in a portfolio of US funds and the fair value of the funds at the balance sheet date are recognised by the Group as a long term receivable.

The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group also leases vehicles, plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
31 Contingent liabilities At the balance sheet date, the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to subsidiaries.
From time to time, the Group is notified of claims in respect of work carried out.
Where management believes we are in a strong position to defend these claims no provision is made.
The Group is aware of challenges to historic employment practices which may have an impact on the Group, including the application of National Insurance Contributions to workers in the UK Continental Shelf.
In addition, recent court cases have challenged the UKs historic interpretation of EU legislation relating to holiday pay and this may have an impact on all companies who have employees in the UK, including Wood Group.
At this point, we do not believe that it is probable that a liability, if any, will arise from any of these claims and therefore no provision has been made.
32 Capital and other financial commitments 2016 2015 $m $m Contracts placed for future capital expenditure not provided in the financial statements 8.1 5.0 The capital expenditure above relates to property plant and equipment.
