A definition of the alternative performance measures included in the Annual Report and a reconciliation to the closest IFRS equivalent are disclosed below.
Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit excludes the amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and costs associated with acquisitions.
A reconciliation between operating profit as reported under IFRS and adjusted operating profit is given below.

ROCE measures effective management of fixed assets and working capital relative to the profitability of the business.
ROCE is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by average capital employed.
Average capital employed is based on capital employed at 31st December 2016 and 31st December 2015 at reported exchange rates.
More information on ROCE can be found in the Capital Employed and ROCE sections of the Financial Review on page 50.

These strip out the effects of the movement of foreign currency exchange rates and of acquisitions and disposals.
The Board believe that this allows users of the accounts to gain a further understanding of how the Group has performed.
The exchange movement is calculated as the difference between the prior period reported value translated at prior period exchange rates and translated at current period exchange rates.
Any acquisitions and disposals that occurred in either the current period or prior period are excluded from the results of both the prior and current period at current period exchange rates.
A reconciliation of the movement in revenue and adjusted operating profit compared to the prior period is given below.

The blended tax rate is calculated using each company's headline tax rate as a proportion of its respective profit.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on 1st April 2015.
Further reductions to 19% effective from April 2017 and then 17% effective from 1st April 2020 were substantively enacted on 15th September 2016.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2016 have been calculated based upon rates of 20%, 19% and 17% in respect of deferred tax expected to reverse before 1st April 2017, 1st April 2020 and after this date respectively.
No UK tax after double tax relief for underlying tax is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
The effective tax rate is calculated as a percentage of profit before tax and share of profit of Associates.

These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed five year forecasts.
This information has been approved by the Board: the key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows: pre-tax discount rates range from 1117% 2015: 1017% : short-term growth rates vary between 226% depending on detailed forecasts 2015: 230%.
The short-term is defined as not more than five years.
The 26% rate is in respect of Spirax-Sarco Colombia SAS: long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts and vary between 0.85.0% 2015: 0.85.0% : and no impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest goodwill balances were as follows: Pretax Shortterm Longterm Cashgenerating unit discount rate growth rate growth rate Aflex 11.2% 5-11% 2.5% Flexicon A S Denmark 11.1% 3.0% 2.0% Spirax-Sarco Mexicana 14.8% 4.0% 2.8% Sensitivity analysis shows that if long-term revenue growth assumptions are lowered by 1% and pre-tax discount rates raised by 1%, no impairment would arise.
The 1% sensitivity threshold is considered a reasonable estimate of possible change.

144 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information 24 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting Income Statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the Income Statement totalled 9.3m 2015: 8.0m.
In the UK, following the closure ofthe defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements The Group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees length of service.
Whilst the Groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the USA as well as less material schemes elsewhere.
In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately half of the Groups net balance sheet liability for defined retirement benefit schemes.
Spirax-Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax-Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax-Sarco Executives' Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Watson-Marlow Pension Fund.
These are all final salary pension schemes.
The UK schemes are closed to new members but are open to future accrual.
There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases in payment and deferment which vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of.
All three schemes have been setup under UK law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the schemes investments, administration and management.
A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries.
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax Sarco.
Further information on the contribution commitments is shown in the Financial Review on pages 50 to 51.
US defined benefit schemes The Group operates a pension scheme in the USA which is closed to new entrants but open to future accrual and defines the pension in terms of the highest average pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement.
No pension increases in payment and deferment are offered by this scheme.
It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the USA, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal risks The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures.
Annual increase in benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and the actual longevity of the membership.
Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms.
A key risk is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension schemes.
All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions.
These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that are subject to change and may impact on the Groups pension schemes.
The IAS 19 liability measurement known as Defined Benefit Obligation DBO and the Service Cost are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit payments, the most important of these assumptions being the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life expectation.
The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the projected benefit payments.
The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Investment strategies are set with funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of DBO.
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 148.

Share-based payments Disclosures of the share-based payments offered to employees are set out below.
More detail on each scheme is given in the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016 on pages 91 to 92.
The charge to the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments is made up as follows: 2016 2015 m m Performance Share Plan 1.0 2.5 Employee Share Ownership Plan 0.9 0.8 Total expense recognised in Income Statement 1.9 3.3 Share Option Scheme The Group operates equity settled share option schemes for employees, although no grants have been made since 2011 because awards have been made using the Group's Performance Share Plan instead.
Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective was to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted before 2007 the performance condition is an increase in earnings per share EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three-year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.
The relevant disclosures in respect of the share option scheme grants are set out on the following page.

The weighted average share price during the period was 37.99 2015: 32.07.
Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
The performance criteria is split into two separate parts.
For awards granted from 2014 40% of the award is based on a TSR measure where the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
For awards granted from 2014 the second part, amounting to 60% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
Awards made prior to 2014 had a weighting of 60% TSR and 40% EPS.
From 2015 a change has been made to measure EPS on a point to point basis over the three-year performance period.
From 2016 EPS growth is measured against the growth of global industrial production IP, as published by CHR Economics with thresholds of plus 2% and plus 8%.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology.

The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions.
Employees are invited to join the ESOP when an offer is made each year.
Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules.
The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

6 0.5m of acquisition costs were incurred in relation to these acquisitions.
The acquired intangibles relate to customer relations, technology based assets and marketing based assets.
28 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and shortterm deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans, facilities and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its Balance Sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Financial instruments fair value disclosure Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2.

All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt within the Statement of total Comprehensive Income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the Income Statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December 2016 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary asset of 3.4m 2015: 2.3m net monetary asset and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 16.6m 2015: net monetary asset 5.5m.
At 31st December 2016, the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 3% 2015: nil for the Chinese renminbi, 1% 2015: 1% for Japanese yen, nil 2015: nil for the euro and nil 2015: nil for theUS dollar.
Maturity of financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities at 31st December mature in the following periods: Trade and other Shortterm Finance Longterm payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 2016 m m m m m m In six months or less, or on demand 65.6 0.4 27.2 0.1 0.1 93.4 In more than six months but no more than 12 0.8 5.8 0.1 0.1 6.8 In more than one year but no more than two 0.1 0.1 58.2 58.4 In more than two years but no more than three 0.1 0.1 In more than three years but no more than four In more than four years but no more than five In more than five years Total contractual cash flows 66.5 0.4 33.0 0.4 58.4 158.7 Balance sheet values 66.5 0.4 33.0 0.4 58.0 158.3 Trade and other Short-term Finance Long-term payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 2015 m m m m m m In six months or less, or on demand 51.0 0.2 4.2 0.2 55.6 In more than six months but no more than 12 0.4 3.7 5.9 0.2 10.2 In more than one year but no more than two 0.1 0.1 80.6 80.8 In more than two years but no more than three In more than three years but no more than four In more than four years but no more than five In more than five years Total contractual cash flows 51.5 3.9 10.1 0.5 80.6 146.6 Balance sheet values 51.5 3.9 10.1 0.5 80.5 146.5 Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship.
At 31st December 2016 the Group had contracts outstanding to purchase nil 2015: 7.3m, and nil 2015: 2.4m with US dollars, 1.0m 2015: 1.0m with Danish krone, 8.4m 2015: 13.1m with euros, 0.3m 2015: 0.7m with Japanese yen, 0.2m with Korean won, 0.1m with Canadian dollars and 0.1m with Czech koruna.
The fair values at the end of the reporting period were an asset of 0.2m 2015: 0.2m liability.
The fair value of cash flow hedges falls into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available market data.
The contractual cash flows on forward currency contracts at the reporting date are shown on page 157, classified by maturity.
The cash flows shown are on a gross basis and are not discounted.

At this time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss.
All forecast transactions which have been subject to hedge accounting during the year have occurred or are still expected to occur.
A profit on derivative financial instruments of 0.4m 2015: nil was recognised in other comprehensive income during the period.
No amount 2015: nil was removed from equity during the period and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability whose acquisition or incurrence was a hedged highly probable forecast transaction.
As at 31st December 2016 no ineffectiveness has been recognised in profit or loss arising from hedging foreign currency transactions.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which allconditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2016 2015 m m Expiring in one year or less 14.6 14.9 Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years 52.0 30.0 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years Expiring in more than three years Total Group undrawn committed facilities 66.6 44.9 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2016 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market by discounting the future contracted cash flows using readily available market data.
Interestbearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
156 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2016 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2016 157 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At the year end borrowings totalled 91.8m 2015: 95.0m.
At 31st December 2016, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately nil 2015: 0.6m reduction.
For the year ended 31st December 2016, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.5m 2015: 1.5m.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
The credit risk profile of trade receivables The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m m Not past due date 124.1 0.3 89.7 0.2 030 days past due date 35.5 30.2 3190 days past due date 19.1 0.4 17.8 0.3 91 days to one year past due date 10.8 3.3 16.1 1.2 More than one year 8.2 8.2 8.6 8.6 Group total 197.7 12.2 162.4 10.3 Based on past experience, the Group believes no further impairment allowance is required for receivables that are past their due date.
