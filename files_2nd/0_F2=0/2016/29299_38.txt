Dividend tax allowance In respect of UK shareholders, from April 2016 dividend tax credits were replaced by an annual 5,000 tax-free allowance on dividend income across an individuals entire share portfolio.
Above this amount, individuals will pay tax on their dividend income at a rate dependent on their income tax bracket and personal circumstances.
The Company will continue to provide registered shareholders with a confirmation of the dividends paid by SIG plc and this should be included with any other dividend income received when calculating and reporting total dividend income received.
It is the shareholders responsibility to include all dividend income when calculating any tax liability.
If you have any tax queries, please contact a financial advisor.
