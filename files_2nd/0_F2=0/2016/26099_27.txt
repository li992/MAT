Our audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ISAs UK & Ireland.
In our opinion: The consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of its profit for the year then ended The consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and The consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Jersey Law 1991 2.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of a material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we considered areas where the directors were required to make subjective judgments and assumptions and to consider future events that are inherently uncertain.
We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias in those judgments that created a risk of misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement detailed in this section of this report are those that we deemed to have had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in our audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Our audit procedures relating to these risks were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and our report is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of these risks, and we do not express an opinion on these individual risks.
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the consolidated financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our Group audit was the valuation of the investment property and property, plant and equipment portfolio 2,814.6 million December 2015: 2,613.5 million.
i The risks The valuation of the Groups investment properties and property, plant and equipment involves significant management judgments, particularly those relating to current and expected market conditions.
In recent times, macroeconomic conditions in Europe have been characterized by lower growth and inflation expectations, accommodative monetary policies by central banks and generally lower interest rates, all of which have provided a supportive backdrop for many real estate investments.
Local market conditions also have a great bearing on real estate valuations and can differ significantly across markets, property types and over time.
For development properties, additional subjective factors include projections of the amount and timing of the costs required to complete a project.
To assist in determining the value of the Groups portfolio, the directors engaged external valuers, CBRE and Colliers.
The directors estimates of the value of the portfolio were developed using the advice and input of the Valuers.
Unreasonable or outdated inputs used in these judgments, such as those in respect to estimated rental value or yield, could result in material misstatement of the income statement and balance sheet.
There is also a risk that management could influence these judgments to report valuations that assist in meeting market expectations or performance targets.
ii How our audit work addressed these risks Among other procedures: We read the valuation reports for all properties and confirmed that the valuation approach for each was in accordance with Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation Professional Standards RICS and suitable for use in determining the carrying value for the purpose of the financial statements We assessed the qualifications, independence and objectivity of the Valuers by reviewing their terms of engagement, fee arrangements, and the existence of any potential conflicts created if they had advised on a transaction that they were subsequently valuing.
We obtained confirmation from the Valuers that they had not been subject to influence from management and we found no evidence to suggest their objectivity was compromised We held several discussions with the Valuers to understand their view of market dynamics, the valuation techniques used, the performance of the portfolio, and the significant assumptions including future expected rental income and likely yields We included a Chartered Surveyor on our team who considered the Valuers qualifications and together, we discussed with the Valuers, the valuation approaches and assumptions We considered the yield assumptions used in performing the valuations to assess their reasonableness in comparison to relevant market evidence, benchmarking expected rental values and yields against comparables and other external data We performed analytical procedures by reference to external market data to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuations adopted by the Group, and investigated further the valuation of those properties that were outside of our expectations We conducted site visits on major properties to corroborate certain details of the external valuation reports We evaluated whether sufficient disclosures were provided in relation to risks inherent in the asset valuations 82 Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financials Additional information 3.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit We apply a concept of materiality in planning and performing our audit, and also in evaluating the effects of misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements.
In considering whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, we consider the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a knowledgeable member, relying on the financial statements, would be altered or influenced.
We then use this materiality to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole to an appropriately low level.
The materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole was set at 33.0 million 2015: 30.0 million, or 1% of total assets.
Because real estate investments represent almost 88% of total assets, we consider total assets to be one of the principal measurements for members of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
In addition, a number of key performance indicators are driven by income statement items and, accordingly, we applied a lower specific materiality of 9.2 million 2015: 7.4 million based on profit before tax, valuation movements, and finance costs, for testing other account balances.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to them corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess of 1.65 million 2015: 1.5 million in respect of investment property and property, plant and equipment, as well as those with a value in excess of 0.46 million 2015: 0.37 million for other account balances.
We also agreed to report other audit misstatements below these thresholds that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The structure of the Groups finance function is such that transactions and balances are accounted for by a central group finance team.
We performed audit procedures, including those in relation to the risks set out above, on those transactions and balances accounted for at group level.
Our audits covered 100% of total consolidated revenue, 100% of consolidated profit before tax and 100% of consolidated total assets.
We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: The Directors statement in the annual report concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the directors assessment and expectations of the Group continuing in operation over the three year period to 2019, or The disclosures in the Directors statement in the annual report concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting 5.
We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception Under the ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if: We have identified any inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors statement that they consider the annual report and the financial statements as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess the entitys position and performance, business model and strategy, or The report from the Audit Committee does not appropriately disclose those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee The Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority require us to review: The Directors statement in the annual report in relation to going concern and longer term viability The part of the Corporate Governance Statement in the annual report relating to the Companys compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review, and Certain elements of remuneration disclosures in the report to shareholders by the directors 6.
Our conclusions on other matters on which we are required to report by the Companies Jersey Law 1991 are set out below We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Jersey Law 1991 which requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company Returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us The financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records, or We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 83 Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Independent auditors report to the members of Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc continued Basis of our report, responsibilities and restrictions on use As explained more fully in the Directors responsibilities statement set out in the annual report the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Financial Reporting Councils Ethical Standards for Auditors.
An audit undertaken in accordance with ISAs UK & Ireland involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited consolidated financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
While an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK & Ireland is designed to provide reasonable assurance of identifying material misstatements or omissions it is not guaranteed to do so.
Rather, the auditor plans the audit to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not exceed materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
This testing requires us to conduct significant audit work on a broad range of assets, liabilities, income and expense as well as devoting significant time of the most experienced members of the audit team, in particular the engagement partner responsible for the audit, to subjective areas of the accounting and reporting.
Our report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
