Annual Report and Accounts 2016 111 James Fisher and Sons plc Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Explanatory Notes Resolution 1 Annual Report The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors of a public company to lay its Annual Report before the Company in general meeting, giving shareholders the opportunity to ask questions on the contents.
The Annual Report comprises the accounts, the auditors report, the Directors report, the Directors remuneration report and the Strategic report.
The Company proposes, as an ordinary resolution, a resolution on its Annual Report in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code Code.
Resolution 2 Approval of the Annual statement by the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Annual report on remuneration The Company proposes an ordinary resolution to approve the Annual Statement by the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Annual report on remuneration for the financial year ended 31December 2016.
The Annual statement and the Annual report on remuneration are set out on pages 38 and 39 and on pages 45 to 52 of the Annual Report.
The vote on this Resolution is advisory only and the Directors entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on its being passed.

In accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006 CA 2006, a separate resolution on the remuneration policy Policy part of the Directors remuneration report must be approved by shareholders at least every three years, unless during that time it is to be changed.
The current Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM and the Directors do not propose any changes to the Policy this year.
The Policy is therefore not required to be approved at this years AGM.
Resolution 3 Declaration of final dividend A final dividend can only be paid after it has been approved by the shareholders in general meeting and may not exceed the amount recommended by the Board.

Following performance reviews the Chairman and the Board believe that each of the Directors standing for re-election continue to perform effectively and with commitment to their role including commitment of time for Board and Committee meetings and other duties.
The Board also considers that each of the Non-Executive Directors is independent in character and judgement.
Each of Resolutions 4 to 10 shall be proposed as ordinary resolutions.
Biographical details of each of our Directors appear on page 27 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 11 and 12 Re-appointment of auditor auditors remuneration The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company, to hold ofce until the conclusion of the next such meeting.

The authority will expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2018, or, if earlier, on 30June 2018 and replaces an authority granted on 28April 2016 which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
At 28February 2017, the Company does not hold any treasury shares.
112 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Resolutions 14 and 15 Permission to allot a limited number of shares other than to existing shareholders Resolution 14, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks to renew the authority conferred on the Directors at last years AGM to issue equity securities of the Company for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
Other than in connection with a rights or other similar issue or scrip dividend where difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of 627,157 representing 2,508,627 ordinary shares which represents approximately 5% of the Companys issued equity share capital as at 28February 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice.
In line with best practice, the Company has not issued more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a non-pro rata basis over the last three years and the Directors confirm their intention to follow the best practice set out in the Pre-Emption Groups Statement of Principles which provides that companies should not issue shares for cash representing more than 7.5% of the Companys issued share capital in any rolling three-year period, other than to existing shareholders, without prior consultation with shareholders.
Resolution 15 is in addition to Resolution 14 and is also a special resolution.
As supported by the Pre-Emption Groups Statement of Principles, as updated in March 2015, Resolution 15 will enable the Directors to allot shares for cash or sell shares out of treasury up to a further nominal amount of 627,157 representing 2,508,627 ordinary shares representing approximately 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 28February 2017, being the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice, without first having to offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
In respect of the authority under Resolution 15, the Board confirms that it will only allot shares or sell shares out of treasury pursuant to this authority where the relevant acquisition or specified capital investment is announced contemporaneously with the allotment, or has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
The Directors have no current intention of exercising this authority.
If this authority is used, the Company will publish details of the placing in its next Annual Report and Accounts.
The authorities under Resolutions 14 and 15 will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2018 or on 30June 2018, whichever is earlier.
Resolution 16 Authority to purchase own shares This special resolution, gives the Company authority to purchase in the market up to 2,508,627 of its ordinary shares of 25p each representing approximately 5% of the Companys total issued ordinary share capital.
The minimum and maximum prices at which such shares can be purchased is as stated in the resolution.
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2018, or on 30June 2018, whichever is earlier, and replaces a similar authority granted on 28April 2016 which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are not held by the Company as treasury shares then such shares would be immediately cancelled in which event the number of ordinary shares in issue would be reduced.
As at 28February 2017, being the latest practical date before publication of this Notice, there were options over ordinary shares in the capital of the Company representing 2.07% of the Companys total issued share capital.
If the authority to purchase the Companys ordinary shares was exercised in full and those shares were subsequently cancelled, these options would represent 2.18% of the Companys total issued share capital.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise this authority and in reaching their decision to purchase ordinary shares will take into account, amongst other things, the Companys cash resources and capital requirements, the effect of any purchase on earnings per share and whether it is in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Resolution 17 Authority to hold general meetings other than an AGM on 14 clear days notice.
This special resolution renews an authority given at last years AGM and is required as a result of section 307A of the 2006 Act.
The Company is currently able to call general meetings other than an AGM on 14 clear days notice.
In order to be able to preserve this ability, shareholders must have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days notice.
Resolution 17, which is proposed as a special resolution, seeks such approval.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next AGM, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for general meetings, but only where the exibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation The Directors consider that the proposed resolutions set out in the Notice of AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of them, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own holdings of shares in the Company.
