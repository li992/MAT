Market risk Interest rate risk Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The companys principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below shows the repricing profile of the companys financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

A 10% strengthening of the US dollar would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Price risk The group's exposure to price risk, all of which is through the company's holdings of equity investment securities, is described in note 31.
Fair values The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2015: none.
Details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
In the current year, there were no gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments categorised as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
In 2015, a loss of 1,030,000 was recognised in profit or loss in relation to derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of the companys financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of equity investments in subsidiaries, which are carried at historical cost note 43.
52 Capital management The companys objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the companys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
For monitoring purposes, the company defines capital as distributable reserves see note 42.
The company monitors the level of distributable reserves on a monthly basis and compares this to forecast dividends.
Capital is distributed to the company from opera ting subsidiaries on a timely basis to ensure sufficient capital is maintained.
The board of directors considers the level of capital held in relation to forecast performance, dividend payments and wider plans for the business, although formal quantitative targets are not set.
There were no changes in the companys approach to capital management during the year.
