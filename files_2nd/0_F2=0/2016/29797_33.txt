Explanation for transition to FRS 101 from UK GAAP This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101.
The last financial statements were prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2015.
This note explains the principal adjustment made by the Company in restating its balance sheet as at 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2015.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of paragraphs 6-33 of IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Reporting Standards.
As previously Effect on As restated As previously Effect on As restated stated transition under FRS 101 stated transition under FRS 101 1 April 2014 1 April 2014 1 April 2014 31 March 2015 31 March 2015 31 March 2015 m m m m m m Fixed assets Tangible assets 13 9 4 18 14 4 Intangible assets 9 9 14 14 Investments in subsidiary undertakings 999 999 1 003 5 1 008 Investment in associate 1 1 1 1 Total 1 013 1 013 1 022 5 1 027 Current assets Debtors 1 501 1 501 1 586 1 586 Cash at bank 1 1 1 1 1 502 1 502 1 587 1 587 Creditors amounts falling due within one year 1 533 1 533 1 635 1 635 Net current assets 31 31 48 48 Total assets less current liabilities 982 982 974 5 979 Creditors amounts falling due after more than one year 2 2 2 2 Net assets 980 980 972 5 977 Capital and reserves Called up share capital 117 117 117 117 Share premium account 406 406 406 406 Capital redemption reserve 8 8 8 8 Profit and loss account 449 449 441 5 446 Total shareholders funds 980 980 972 5 977 Under its previous UK GAAP accounting policy, an investment in an overseas subsidiary undertaking or associate was retranslated if it was financed by foreign currency borrowings and the borrowings were designated as a hedging instrument in relation to the investment.
If this were the case, the resulting translation gain or loss on the investment was recognised directly in reserves where, to the extent that the hedge was effective, it would be offset by the translation gain or loss on the related borrowings.
However, under FRS 101 non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and translation gains or losses on the related borrowings are recognised in profit and loss.
On transition to FRS 101, the deemed cost for the investments has been based on the carrying value as at the transition date.
The impact of this GAAP difference is a 5 million gain for the 31 March 2015 balance sheet.
The transition to FRS 101 has also resulted in a re-classification of computer software from tangible assets to intangible assets.
