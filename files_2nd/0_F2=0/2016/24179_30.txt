Accordingly, the Groups profits for the accounting period to 30 June 2015 were taxed at a blended standard rate of 20.75%: and for the period to 30 June 2016 are taxed at the standard rate of 20.0%.
Further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the July 2015 UK Budget Statement.
The main rate of corporation tax will reduce to 19% from April 2017 and was scheduled to reduce to 18% from April 2020.
These rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A further reduction to 17% from April 2020 was announced in the March 2016 UK Budget Statement but this rate reduction had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, the relevant deferred tax balances have not been remeasured.
Due to the uncertainty of the rate that will apply from April 2020, deferred tax has been recognised at 19%.
The effect on the deferred tax balances, had the new rates been applied at 30 June 2016, would not have been significant.

8 Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held by the Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option in the period.
The dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option price.
Only shares that have met their cumulative performance criteria are included in the dilution calculation.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.
A loss per share cannot be reduced through dilution, hence this dilution is only applied where the Group has reported a profit.
The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

This was allocated to the Building and Linden Homes segments respectively.
102 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10 Goodwill continued Goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs identified according to business segment.
The goodwill is attributable to the following business segments: 2016 2015 m m Linden Homes 52.5 52.5 Partnerships & Regeneration 5.8 5.8 Building 40.0 40.0 Infrastructure 37.2 37.2 135.5 135.5 Impairment review of goodwill and key assumptions Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on future financial budgets approved by the Board, based on past performance and its expectation of market developments.
The key assumptions within these budgets relate to revenue and the future profit margin achievable, in line with our strategy as set out in the Strategic Report.
Future budgeted revenue is based on managements knowledge of actual results from prior years and latest forecasts for the current year, along with the existing secured works, managements expectation of the future level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices for completed houses.
In establishing future profit margins, the margins currently being achieved are considered in conjunction with expected inflation rates in each cost category and to reflect the current market value of land being acquired.
Cash is monitored very closely on a daily, weekly and monthly basis for the purposes of managing both treasury and the business as a whole.
Details of the Groups treasury management are included within the financial review in the Strategic Report of the Annual Report.
The assumptions used are reviewed regularly and differences between forecast and actual results are closely monitored with variances being investigated fully.
The knowledge gained from this past experience is used to ensure that the future assumptions used are consistent with past actual outcomes and are managements best estimate of the future cash flows of each business unit.
Cash flows beyond the budgeted three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum within each segment.
The growth rate used is the Groups estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the market sectors in which the CGU operates.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.7% 2015: 12.1% in Linden Homes, 10.1% 2015: 9.9% in Partnerships & Regeneration, 10.1% 2015: 9.3% in Building and 11.6% 2015: 10.1% in Infrastructure has been applied to the future cash flows, based on a estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of each division.
Sensitivities The recoverable value of all CGUs are substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU.
Taking into account current market conditions within the construction and housebuilding markets, none of these sensitivities, either individually or combined, resulted in the recoverable amount of the goodwill being reduced to below its current carrying value.
The detailed sensitivity analysis indicates that an increase of more than 22% 2015: 17% in the pre-tax discount rate or a reduction of 27% 2015: 21% in the forecast operating cash flows of the Linden Homes CGU could give rise to an impairment.
The goodwill in the other segments is less sensitive to the detailed assumptions used and hence no additional disclosure is considered necessary.
Fixed assets included 0.9 million net book value, and 0.6 million depreciation, for assets held under finance leases 2015: 1.5 million and 0.5 million, respectively.
The Company has no property, plant or equipment.

The shared equity receivables largely have repayment dates that can vary and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of the sales transaction and are secured by a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future receivable by the Group, discounted back to present values.
The fair value of the future anticipated receipts takes into account the directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and credit risk.
These assumptions are reviewed at the end of each financial reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk, which is largely mitigated by holding a second charge over the property, is accounted for in determining the fair values and appropriate discount rates that are applied.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.
The Group has sold the majority of its shared equity portfolio.
During the year the Groups net investment in shared equity receivables decreased by 0.1 million 2015: 21.5 million.
There was Nil million new shared equity receivables in the period and Nil million 2015: 0.8 million arose on the unwind of the discount applied on initial recognition of the receivables at fair value, which has been shown as finance income in the income statement.
An impairment of Nil million 2015: 0.5 million arose due to the variation in current assumptions compared to the original calculations.
There were disposals in the year of 0.1 million 2015: 21.8 million, relating to the repayment of shared equity receivables and the sale of the portfolio, generating a profit on disposal of 0.1 million 2015: 0.4 million.

Amounts charged to the impairment provision are generally written off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
Provisions for amounts due from joint venture undertakings are set out in note 13.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the book value of each class of receivable mentioned above, along with the Groups investment in shared equity receivables note 14 and its cash and cash equivalents.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
Management believes that the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Major water industry customers accounted for in total 3% 2015: 4% of Group revenue in the year.
However, the customers involved comprise a variety of entities including those both in the public and commercial sectors.
In addition, within the commercial sector each customer has an unrelated ultimate parent company.

The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 599.8 million of bank accounts in credit offset against 433.5 million overdrafts with the same counterparty 2015: 578.1 million and 413.2 million respectively.
The Group and Company operate within financial risk policies and procedures approved by the Board.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
The Groups and Companys financial instruments principally comprise bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, available for sale financial assets and interest rate swaps that arise directly from its operations and its acquisitions.
Capital risk management The Group is funded by ordinary shares, retained profits and a single bank facility.
The Groups and Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital requirements of the Groups divisions differ, with housebuilding including Linden Homes and the mixed-tenure developments of Partnerships & Regeneration typically requiring debt and construction typically being cash generative, and the economic cycle of each business is also different.
The Group manages its capital taking these differing requirements into account.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group and Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
In 2016, the Group increased its bank facilities to 450 million, following a review of its future capital requirements undertaken in the context of the Groups strategy to 2018, and the Group is targeting period-end gearing of no more than 30%.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group held net debt at 30 June 2016 and had gearing of 1%.
The Group also held net debt at 30 June 2015, with gearing of 3%.
The Group also has capital requirements in the covenants in its bank facilities, as set out later in this note.
The Group has complied with all bank covenants during the year.
Financial risk factors a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk All material activities of the Group take place within the UK and consequently there is little direct exchange risk other than payments to overseas suppliers who require settlement in their currency.
If there is any material foreign exchange exposure, the Groups policy is to enter into forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group and Company have no material currency exposure at 30 June 2016 2015: Nil.
ii Price risk The Group is affected by the level of UK house prices.
These are in turn affected by factors such as mortgage availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and availability of land with planning.
While it is not possible to fully mitigate such risks the Group continues to monitor its geographical spread within the UK concentrating its operations in areas that management believes minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
As at 30 June 2016, the Groups house price linked financial instruments consisted entirely of shared equity receivables held as available for sale financial assets and the sensitivity to house price inflation and discount rates was not significant.
The concentration of the financial risk lies within price risk as a result of these financial instruments being linked to house prices.
The Group has no quoted investments that are exposed to equity securities price risk.
The Group and Company are not exposed to commodity price risk.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from movement in cash and cash equivalents and long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk as long as the effect of various changes in rates remains within prescribed ranges.
Details of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group are set out below.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
On a regular basis the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift on the Groups borrowing position.
Based on the forecasts performed, the impact on post tax profit and equity of a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates for a year would be a maximum increase of 0.8 million 2015: 0.7 million or decrease of 1.0 million 2015: 0.8 million, respectively.
Our Business Governance Financial Information Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 113 25 Financial Instruments continued Financial risk factors continued b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits and borrowings with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables including shared equity receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a credit risk exposure to the providers of its banking facilities.
These are primarily provided by HSBC Bank plc, Abbey National Treasury Services plc Santander, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Barclays Bank plc, being four of the UKs leading financial institutions.
Further details of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 18.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period, and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of any counterparties, including in respect of receivables not yet due.
c Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The contracting operations of the Group generally generate cash.
The housebuilding operations, however, utilise cash and any future downturn in the housebuilding market may require additional borrowings, in addition to retained earnings, to finance the maintenance of the landbank and associated work in progress.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity reserve, which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities see below and cash and cash equivalents note 19 on the basis of expected cash flow.
This is generally carried out at local level in the operating companies of the Group, in accordance with practices and limits set by the Group.
These limits vary by location to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates.
On a daily basis throughout the year, the bank balances or borrowings in all the Groups operating companies are aggregated into a total cash or borrowings figure, in order that the Group can obtain the most advantageous interest rate.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
No such embedded derivatives have been identified.
Financial liabilities derivative financial liabilities The fair value of interest rate swaps is detailed below: 2016 2015 Group and Company m m At 30 June 2015 Non-current liabilities 4.5 0.3 During the year ending 30 June 2012 the Group entered into a five-year interest rate swap contract that expires in May 2017.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 30 June 2016 was 75 million 2015: 75 million and the fixed interest rate is 1.5% 2015: 1.5%.
During the year ending 30 June 2015 the Group entered into a five-year interest rate swap contract that expires in February 2020.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract at 30 June 2016 was 100 million 2015: 100 million and the fixed interest rate is 1.4% 2015: 1.4%.
Each swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and changes in fair value are recognised directly in reserves.
A loss of 4.2 million 2015: 0.3 million was recognised in other comprehensive income in the period.
Gains and losses recognised in reserves will be released to the income statement within finance costs over the period to maturity of the contract, and 1.2 million 2015: 0.1 million was recognised in the current year.
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at the prevailing interest rate.
The fair value of current borrowings equals their carrying amounts as the impact of discounting is not significant.

A maturity analysis of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilties is given in note 23.
There is no difference between the book value and the fair value of the Companys other financial assets and financial liabilities.
Borrowing facilities The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 30 June: 2016 2015 Floating rate Floating rate m m Expiring: In more than two years 259.7 211.4 259.7 211.4 In February 2014 the Group agreed a five-year 400 million unsecured revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc, Abbey National Treasury Services plc Santander, Barclays Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
In February 2015, the Group agreed a one-year extension on the facility, to 2020, and in March 2016 agreed an increase in the facility to 450 million.
The facility provides long-term finance and bonding facilities and is subject to covenants over interest cover, gearing adjusted to take account of development land payables and minimum consolidated tangible net assets.
Interest is calculated by aggregating margin, LIBOR and relevant costs.
Our Business Governance Financial Information Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 115 25 Financial Instruments continued Fair value estimation Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments are defined as: Level 1 quoted market prices or dealer quotes in active markets for similar instruments.
Level 2 the fair value of equity securities and interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, based on observable yield curves, as set out in note 14.
Level 3 other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of available for sale financial assets is set out in note 14.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 30 June: 30 June 2016 30 June 2015 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m Assets Available for sale financial assets Shared equity receivables 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 Equity securities 16.2 16.2 10.2 10.2 Total 16.2 0.7 16.9 10.2 0.8 11.0 Liabilities Liabilities at fair value through income statement Derivatives used for hedging 4.5 4.5 0.3 0.3 There we no transfers between levels during the period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The Companys only liabilities that are measured at fair value are derivatives used for hedging, as shown in the table above.

The typical repayment period is 10-15 years and the timing of receipts is based on historical data.
The discount rate of 5.5% and future house price movements used to compute the fair value typically 2.5% are based on local market conditions.
The sensitivity to house price inflation and discount rates is set out earlier in this note.
If receipts were to occur earlier than expected, the fair value would increase.
The total impact in the period of Level 3, taken to the income statements, is a net charge of Nil million 30 June 2015: 0.1 million in cost of sales and Nil million 30 June 2015: 0.8 million finance income.

Savings related share options The Company operates an HMRC approved sharesave scheme under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at grant, in either three or five years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
This scheme is open to all employees meeting the minimum employment period.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of sharesave options.
The options were valued using the binomial option-pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Employee turnover Share price Exercise Contract Expected Option life Risk free Dividend before Fair value Grant date at grant date price date volatility years rate yield vesting per option 19.11.10 280p 271p 01.01.11 47% 5 2.4% 4.5% 10% 90.0p 14.11.12 711p 657p 01.01.13 31% 3 0.5% 4.2% 10% 135.5p 14.11.12 711p 657p 01.01.13 46% 5 0.9% 4.2% 10% 222.2p 10.11.14 1175p 931p 01.01.15 23% 3 1.2% 4.5% 10% 214.4p 10.11.14 1175p 931p 01.01.15 28% 5 1.6% 4.5% 10% 254.5p 21.10.15 1562p 1372p 01.01.16 22% 3 0.8% 4.4% 10% 217.6p 21.10.15 1562p 1372p 01.01.16 25% 5 1.2% 4.4% 10% 259.2p Our Business Governance Financial Information Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 117 27 Share-based payments continued Savings related share options continued The expected volatility is based on historical volatility in the movement in the share price over the last three or five years up to the date of grant depending on the option life.

Our Business Governance Financial Information Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 119 30 Retirement benefit obligations All employees are entitled to join the Galliford Try Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme established as a stakeholder plan, with a company contribution based on a scale dependent on the employees age and the amount they choose to contribute.
Since 1 July 2013 all non-participating and newly employed staff have been auto-enrolled into the separate stakeholder plan and are entitled to increase their contribution rates in line with existing members.
Since 1 April 2009, the Group has operated a pension salary sacrifice scheme which means that all employee pension contributions are paid as employer contributions on their behalf.
The Group also operates three defined benefit pension schemes, as detailed below.
Pension costs for the schemes were as follows: 2016 2015 m m Defined benefit schemes expense recognised in the income statement 0.2 0.2 Defined contribution schemes 17.1 14.2 Total included within employee benefit expenses note 3 17.3 14.4 Of the total charge for all schemes 6.7 million 2015: 8.0 million and 10.4 million 2015: 6.2 million were included, respectively, within cost of sales and administrative expenses.
0.2m 2015: 0.2 million was included within net finance costs.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes under the UK regulatory framework that pay out pensions at retirement based on service and final pay, each with assets held in separate trustee administered funds: the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme, the Galliford Group Special Scheme and the Kendall Cross Holdings Ltd Assurance & Pension Scheme.
The financial statements include all three of these arrangements.
The Groups principal funded pension scheme is the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme which was closed to all future service accrual on 31 March 2007.
The Trustees of each scheme are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries and responsible for the investment strategy of the Scheme.
For the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme the Trustee is Galliford Try Pension Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
Currently the Trustee Board includes member-nominated, Company-nominated and independent directors.
The Group is ultimately responsible for making up any shortfall in the Scheme over a period agreed with the Trustees.
To the extent that actual experience is different to that assumed, the contributions required by the Group could vary in the future.
The two key risks faced by pension schemes are longevity i. e. members living longer than expected and investment risk i. e. the schemes assets perform poorly relative to the liabilities.
An independent actuary performs detailed triennial valuations together with periodic interim reviews.
The most recent completed formal actuarial valuation for the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme was as at 1 July 2012 and was prepared by Mercer the scheme actuary.
The latest valuation, as at 1 July 2015, is ongoing.
The Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme closed to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2007.
In June 2016 the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme completed a 95 million insurance buy-in transaction.
The IAS 19 accounting result for the Galliford Try Final Salary Pension Scheme has been calculated using a roll forward approach based on the liabilities calculated for the 1 July 2012 actuarial valuation, and incorporates the insurance buy-in referred to above.
The deficit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees in 2013 requires the Company to pay contributions of 466,667 per calendar month until February 2019, with potential additional payments being linked to dividend payments of the Company.
The latest actuarial valuations for the Galliford Group Special Scheme and the Kendall Cross Holdings Ltd Assurance & Pension Scheme were as at 1 April 2013 and 13 November 2014, respectively.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Galliford Group Special Scheme was prepared using the attained age method as at 1 April 2013.
A deficit recovery funding plan was agreed with the Trustees to meet the funding shortfall, which required the Company to pay contributions of 16,000 per calendar month until September 2014.
The Kendall Cross Holdings Limited Scheme is funded and provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The scheme was closed to new members and to future accrual for existing members prior to the date of the acquisition by Galliford Try plc in November 2007.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was prepared as at 13 November 2014.
A deficit recovery funding plan was agreed with the Trustees which requires the Company to pay contributions of 15,300 per month.
