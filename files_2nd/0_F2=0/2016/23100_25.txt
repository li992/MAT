FINANCIALS SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The financial performance section gives further detail on the information in the Consolidated income statement.
It includes a summary of financial performance by business unit 2.1, analysis of certain income statement items 2.22.6 and information regarding underlying earnings, distributable profits and dividends 2.72.9.
Further commentary regarding our trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61, with particular reference to key achievements and market conditions that have affected our results.
2.1 Segmental reporting The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central head office providing certain corporate functions.
Our businesses are: Generation: the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station: Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US: and Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market.
Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting.
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments.
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA as defined on page 118.
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment.
Head office costs are included within central operating costs.

2 102.6 million of the asset obsolescence charges arose in the Generation segment, with the remaining 6.6 in the Biomass Supply segment.
Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis, with no separate reporting by segment in the Groups management accounts.
However, spend on key capital projects is monitored.
Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2016 was 29 million 2015: 90 million, of which 7 million 2015: 22 million relates to construction of assets, in the US, within the Biomass Supply segment.
The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Groups financial statements.
The external revenues and results of all of our reporting segments are subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.
Intra-group trading Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at the time of the transaction.
During 2016, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of 72.9 million 2015: 28.4 million to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of 868.2 million 2015: 863.2 million to the Retail segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising 2.3 million at 31 December 2016, is eliminated on consolidation.
Major customers Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 includes amounts of 541.5 million and 399.3 million 2015: 597.7 million and 468.0 million derived from two customers 2015: two customers, each representing 10% or more of the Groups consolidated revenue for the year.
These revenues arose in the Generation segment.
126 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 2.2 Revenue Accounting Policy Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions with or between Group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity from our generating assets in Drax Power are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certificates ROCs under the UK Governments Renewables Obligation RO regime.
The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel.
A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet see note 3.2 on page139.
Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to the account of a third party.
Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to business customers through our power retail business, Haven Power, is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale.
Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates: however where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue calculation is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates.
Revenues from the sale of wood pellets through our UK domestic pellet retail business, Billington Bioenergy are recognised at the point the pellets are delivered to the location specified in the contract, which is normally the customers premises.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services for example, the supply of ancillary generation services, such as black start and frequency response, to National Grid are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
Most such contracts are for the delivery of aservice either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the amount ofthe contract term that has elapsed.
Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in enhancing probable futureoutcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum are recognised atthe point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customers premises.
CfD payments The Group is party to a Contract for Difference CfD with The Low Carbon Contracts Company LCCC, a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering elements of the Governments Electricity Market Reform Programme.
Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from one of its three biomass-fuelled generating units.
The payment is calculated with reference to a strike price of 100 per MWh.
The strike price is in 2012 terms and increases each year indexed to UK CPI and system balancing costs.
The strike price at 31 December 2016 was 106 per MWh.
Where market prices at the point of generation are above below the strike price, the Group makes receives an additional payment to from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price.
Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD in the income statement, as a component of revenue, at the point the flow of economic benefit becomes probable.
This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.
The Group began generating under the CfD contract on 21 December 2016 and, in accordance with this policy, accrued 10.3 million of revenue inrespect of amounts due from the LCCC in the period ending 31 December 2016.
127 Annual report and accounts 2016 Drax Group plc SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 2.2 Revenue continued ROC sales The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Groups financial performance.
The RO scheme started in April 2002 and places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources.
Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate they have fulfilled their obligations under the RO.
ROCs are managed in compliance periods CPs, running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the buy-out price at the end of the CP.
The buy-out price was set at 30 ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation.
ROCs are typically procured in arms-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP.
At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the recycle fund, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP.
See note 3.2 on page 139 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by our Generation business and those utilised by our Retail business in the year.
Further analysis of our revenue for the year ending 31 December 2016 is provided in the table below: Year ended 31 December 2016 External Intra-group Total m m m Generation Power sales 1,193.4 686.5 1,879.9 ROC and LEC sales 366.7 181.7 548.4 CfD income 10.3 10.3 Ancillary services 47.3 47.3 Other income 5.0 5.0 Retail Power sales 1,319.6 1,319.6 Pellet sales 6.7 6.7 Other income 0.1 0.1 Biomass Supply Pellet sales 72.9 72.9 Other income 0.7 0.7 Elimination of intra-group sales 941.1 941.1 Total consolidated revenue 2,949.8 2,949.8 The Groups principal revenues arise from the sale of power, both into the wholesale market via Drax Power, our generation business, and to Industrial and Commercial and small and medium-sized enterprise business customers via Haven Power, our energy retail business.
The Group also sells wood pellets into the domestic UK heat market via Billington Bioenergy, part of our retail business.
Drax Biomass, our US-based wood pellet manufacturing business, generates all of its revenues intra-group, selling sustainable wood pellets to Drax Power to be used in the electricity generation process.
ROC sales and CfD income reflect revenues received through Government programmes to support renewable generation.
ROC sales reflect consideration received for sales of ROCs by Drax Power to third parties.
CfD income reflects amounts received under the CfD contract awarded by the UK Government to one of our biomass-fuelled electricity generation units.
See CfD payments above for further details.

2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment Accounting policy The Group reviews its fixed assets or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units CGUs whenever there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered.
The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and Billington Bioenergy and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four CGUs.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU value in use or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant fair value.
The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value inuse.
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate thecash inflows from the CGUs assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs.
Central costs areonly allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGUs activities.
Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a result, the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-tomarket value of those cash flow hedges.
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Groups assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation.
In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using apre-tax rate.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually see note 5.2.
Critical judgement areas In 2015, the market capitalisation of the Group fell materially below the carrying value of the Groups net assets.
Whilst the shortfall has reduced considerably during 2016, this remains the case at the balance sheet date.
In addition, commodity markets are weak and the substantial weakening of Sterling against both the Euro and US dollar in the second half of 2016 indicated a potentially material increase in the long-term costs of fuel for our generation business, which are predominantly priced in these currencies.
Accordingly an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date.
A review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment.
130 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment continued The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
Inparticular, expected future cash flows are based upon managements estimates of future prices, output, costs and economic support for renewable energy generation, including access to Capacity Market and Ancillary Services contracts.
Where relevant and to the fullest extent possible, the key assumptions are based on observable market information.
However, observable market information is only available for a limitedproportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review, The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below.
Impairment review The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2016 was 1,911 million.
The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using the Groups established planning model.
The analysis assumed that Drax Powers three biomass-fuelled generating units would continue in operation until the end of their estimated useful lives, currently considered to be 2039.
In line with our assumption that coal-fired generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the Government consultation published in November 2016, the three remaining coal-fired units were assumed to cease coal-fired generation by thisdate but will then be available for conversion to biomass-fired units.
No account has been taken of any cash inflows that could result from such aconversion which could take place earlier than 2025 in measuring the value in use of the Drax Power CGU.
The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating units and the regulatory regime under which they might operate.
The key assumptions i. e. those most sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome for impairment are considered to be: The expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above: Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments notably power prices and biomassprices: Future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments: and The continuance of existing biomass support regimes CfD and RO until 2027 and the existence of a favourable economic environment forbiomass generation thereafter.
This includes future Capacity Markets and Ancillary Services revenues.
These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements.
The historic volatility in these assumptions is reflected in the financial performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future values.
Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties.
Transactions beyond contracted positions are valued using market data and forward price curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third party source, independent to the Group.
In particular, longer-term power prices are based on Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and National Grid assumptions.
The contracted period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts expiring in 2027.
Beyond this point, estimated biomass prices are largely based on our internal models and expectations for the biomass market.
Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible.
Beyond our contracted position, exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves and, beyond this point, Bloomberg data.
Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume these cease in 2027.
The impairment analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these support mechanisms beyond this date.
The biomass-fuelled units thatare assumed to continue to generate power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary services to the UK grid and an expectation that capacity market revenues would be available to these units.
Our power price forecasts reflect increased volatility between peak and baseload prices.
Assumed revenues from ancillary services and the capacity market are based on projections derived from current contracts and capacity market outcomes and how we expect the market to evolve.
These assumptions reflect our expectation that Drax will be required to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of the UKs energy mix throughout the life of the units.
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 8.4%.
The discount rate is supported by observable market reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and specific to the circumstances of the Group.
This indicated that the recoverable amount of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value with headroom of approximately 200 million and therefore that no provisions for impairment were required.
Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 7% in market power prices, anincrease in biomass prices of approximately 11%, or a depreciation of Sterling against the US dollar of some 8% throughout the 23-year term ofthe valuation would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount.
This does not consider theinteraction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any mitigating actions that could be taken should the changes referred to materialise.
In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable change inthe method of allocation would result in an impairment charge.
131 Annual report and accounts 2016 Drax Group plc SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED 2.5 Net finance costs Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure such as interest payable on our bank loans as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives see note 5.3 and net interest charged on the Groups defined benefit pension scheme obligation see note 6.3.
These are offset by interest income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses for example through investment in money market funds.

Sterling weakened against the US dollar and Euro following the EU referendum in June, resulting in gains being recognised on assets the Group holds denominated in these currencies.
Amortisation of deferred finance costs for the previous period include 0.7 million relating to the previous revolving credit facility for which amortisation was accelerated following the successful renegotiation of a replacement facility in December 2015.
2.6 Current and deferred taxation The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this years taxable profits whichare adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes andtherefore on which we are required to pay additional tax.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
The tax charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction.
Taxable profit or loss differs from profit loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that areeither taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In the UK 2016 Budget, the UK Government proposed a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 18% to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This change was enacted into law inSeptember 2016 and accordingly these rates have been reflected in the UK deferred tax balance at 31 December 2016.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
132 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued Significant judgement areas In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Profit before tax 197.1 59.0 Profit before tax multiplied by the rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% 2015: 20.25% 39.4 11.9 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior periods 3.6 1.5 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.7 0.9 Impact of change to corporation tax rate 9.8 17.8 Difference in overseas tax rates and other benefits 4.8 Deferred tax on prior year start up losses and other temporary differences 21.4 Other 1.7 6.2 Total tax charge 3.2 2.7 The Adjustments in respect of prior periods principally relates to a research and development claim which was successfully concluded with HMRC during the period.

In the period the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset valued at 34 million in respect of start-up losses and other temporary differences in the US-based Drax Biomass business 21 million of this asset relates to losses that arose in previous years.
Recognition in 2016 reflects an improvement in operational performance and the Boards increased confidence regarding the delivery of future taxable profits against which the losses will be utilised currently expected by 2027.
As a one-off and non-cash item, this credit has been excluded from the calculation of underlying earnings and the dividend for 2016 see notes 2.7 and 2.8.
These start-up losses are valued at the US Federal tax rate as was enacted at the balance sheet date 35%.
Should Federal tax rates reduce increase in the future, this will correspondingly reduce increase respectively this net deferred taxasset.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of 2 million at 31 December 2016 2015: 2 million, in respect of UK losses totalling 12 million, that are carried forward against future taxable income.
The business unit involved has a history of making losses and until sufficient operational performance is established and maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable income against which to utilise the benefit of the accumulated losses is not considered to be probable.
2.7 Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share Earnings per share EPS represents the amount of our earnings post-tax profits that is attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings profit after tax calculated in accordance with IFRS by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options such as those to be issued under our employee share schemes see note 6.2, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated note 2.8.
Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, plus particular transactions considered to be one-off in nature that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group, from post-tax profits.
Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period.
