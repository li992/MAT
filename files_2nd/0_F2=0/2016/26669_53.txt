Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill has been allocated across the operating segments, and the value of the recoverable amounts allocated to those segments has been estimated and compared to the carrying amounts.
Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 87.5 million 2015: 87.5 million to Destination and Premium, 86.6 million 2015: 86.6 million to Taverns, 26.5 million 2015: 26.5 million to Leased and 26.9 million 2015: 26.9 million to Brewing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments based on the extent to which the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use are the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of 5.5% 2015: 6.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets of 2.0% 2015: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term growth rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
Risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the Groups operating segments.
Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
These estimates take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had substantial levels of headroom and as such no impairment of goodwill was required in the current or prior period.
