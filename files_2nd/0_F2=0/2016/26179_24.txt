SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED h Financial instruments continued iii Effective interest rate method The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant asset's carrying amount.
iv Fair value estimation The Company's investments at fair value are not traded in active markets.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
In these financial statements, investment at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value of the Company's direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which comprises the fair value of JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. all the intermediate holding companies and the PPP investments.
Fair value of the PPP investments is calculated by discounting at an appropriate discount rate future cash ows expected to be received by the Group's intermediate holdings, from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments.
The discount rates are relevant and in the range of those applied in the market for similar PPP investments.
The basis of discount rates are long run average government bond rates adjusted for an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk.
Risk premia are then added to this adjusted base gilt rate depending on the phase of the project and any specic risks to which the project is exposed.
The discount rates that have been applied to the PPP investments at 31 December 2016 were in the range 7.02% to 9.00% 31 December 2015: 7.19% to 8.46%.
Refer to note 10 for details of the areas of estimation in the calculation of the fair value.
JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and the intermediate holding companies net assets are mainly composed of cash and working capital and loan balances and are recognised at fair value which is equivalent to their net assets.
i Segmental reporting In the financial statements, the Company recognises one investment in its 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. The Directors consider and analyse the performance of the Company by considering the Groups main activity which is to invest into PPP investments through its intermediate holding companies.
Information reported to the Companys Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the sector risk associated within the Group.
The Group has investments in the Health, Education, Justice & Emergency Services, Transport, Regeneration & Social Housing, Government Buildings and Street Lighting sectors and therefore these form the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8.
The Directors also consider and analyse the performance of the Group by Geography as the Group predominately invests in the UK, but also has investments in Continental Europe, North America as well as administration functions in Guernsey.
Geographical segments therefore form part of the Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8. j Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is a Registered Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In the application of the Company's accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities that affect reported amounts.
Fair value of PPP investments Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash ows at the appropriate rate.
Estimates such as future cash ows are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These cash ows also contain various assumptions, most signicantly the ination rate, deposit rate and tax rates used in forecasting the expected cash ows for each period.
Sensitivities to these critical assumptions and their impact on the fair value of investments at fair value through profit and loss is disclosed in note 10.
In determining the discount rate, management applies their judgement in determining the appropriate risk-free rates and specic risks, and considering the evidence of recent transactions.
Management deems the discount rate to be one of the most significant unobservable inputs and any change in it could have a material impact on the fair value of the investments.
Underlying assumptions and discount rates are disclosed in note 10.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED Fair value of intermediate holding companies The Directors consider that the carrying value of the financial assets and financial liabilities in the underlying holding which are recorded at amortised cost in those financial statements are approximately equal to their fair value.
OPERATING SEGMENTS Information reported to the Companys Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the sector risk associated within the Group.

TAX The Company has obtained exempt status from income tax in Guernsey under the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 1989.
The income from its investments is therefore not subject to any further tax in Guernsey, although the underlying project companies in which the Group invests provide for and pay taxation at the appropriate rates in the countries in which they operate, for further details refer to note 10.
During 2016, the UK proposed new legislation which is broadly in line with a number of the actions from the OECD G20s Base Erosion and profit Shifting BEPS initiative.
Based on the most recent draft legislation in December 2016, we believe that the current response, particularly in relation to the potential restriction of tax deductions for interest, no longer represents such a significant risk to JLIF.
We do not expect the introduction of this legislation to have a material impact on the valuation of the Portfolio.
While recognising that draft legislation is not enacted legislation, the risk has been downgraded in the Companys risk register.
We will continue to monitor proposed legislation, both in the UK and other territories in which JLIF operates, as governments continue to introduce new legislation aligned with the BEPS actions.

INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS CONTINUED The fair value of the intermediate holding companies comprises cash of 27.2 million 2015: 31.3 million, working capital balances of 4.7 million 2015: 1.0 million, offset by debt drawn under the JLIF Limited Partnerships revolving credit facility of 171.4 million 2015: 17.0 million.
The Investment Adviser has carried out fair market valuations of the PPP investments as at 31 December 2016.
The Directors have satisfied themselves as to the methodology used and the discount rates applied for the valuation of the PPP investments.
The Directors have also obtained an independent opinion from a third party, with considerable expertise in valuing these type of investments, supporting the reasonableness of the Portfolio Value.
Investments in PPP projects are valued using a discounted cash ow methodology.
The valuation techniques and methodologies have been applied consistently with the methodology used to value the Portfolio since launch in 2010.
Discount rates applied range from 7.02% to 9.00% weighted average 7.87% 2015: 7.19% to 8.46% weighted average 7.82%.
INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS CONTINUED The UK Finance Bill enacted in September 2016 reduced the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This reduction has been included in the valuation at 31 December 2016.
The fair value of the Continental European, Canadian and US 23 investments include assumed tax payments at the appropriate local rates which are 20% 25%, 26% and 35% 9% respectively.
In December 2016, the UK Government published draft legislation in response to the OECDs Base Erosion profit Sharing BEPS initiative.
Having sought advice from independent tax experts, the Companys assessment of the risk presented by the proposals contained within the draft legislation has resulted in no specic adjustment to be made in the valuation of the Portfolio as at 31 December 2016.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 111.7 million higher or 96.7 million lower 2015: estimated 74.8 million higher or 65.1 million lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by an absolute 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The weighted average discount rate for the PPP portfolio as at 31 December 2016 was 7.87% 2015: 7.82%.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 52.5 million higher 2015: 33.8 million higher if the ination rate used in the discounted cash ow analysis was an absolute 1% higher than that used in the fair value calculation, and 47.3 million lower 2015: 30.8 million lower if the ination rate was an absolute 1% lower.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 21.8 million higher or 21.5 million lower 2015: estimated 18.4 million higher or 18.3 million lower if the deposit rates used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by an absolute 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The fair value of the PPP investments would be an estimated 39.5 million higher or 35.8 million lower 2015: estimated 10.8 million higher or 9.9 million lower if the exchange rates used in the discounted cash ow analysis were to differ by 10% from that used in the fair value calculation.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2016 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and ination risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and capital risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group and its investment entities use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the Company and the intermediate holding companies subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by the Investment Adviser who operates within the Board approved policies.
In relation to the Group's investment in project companies, due to the nature of the investments, certain financial risks typically interest rate and ination risks are hedged at the inception of a project.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Financial risk management Company only The Company accounts for its investments in its subsidiaries at fair value.
To the extent there are changes as a result of the risks set out below, these impact the fair value of the Company's investments.
Capital risk The Company has implemented an efficient nancing structure that enables it to manage its capital effectively.
The Company's capital structure comprises its equity only refer to the Statement of Changes in Equity.
As at 31 December 2016 the Company had no debt 2015: nil.
Liquidity risk The Directors monitor the Company's liquidity requirements to ensure there is sufficient cash to meet the Company's operating needs.
The Company adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its obligations.
Due to the nature of its investments the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Company.
The Company's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows and forecasting the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
The Company was in a net cash position and had no outstanding debt at the balance sheet date 2015: nil.
Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company accounts for its investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S. a. r. l at fair value in Sterling.
The Company's investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S. a. r. l and its subsidiaries have a small proportion of their expenses and net assets denominated in Euro.
The Company considers that the currency exposure is minimal and as such does not require currency hedging.
Financial risk management Company and subsidiaries The following risks impact the Company's subsidiaries and in turn may impact the fair value of investments held by the Company.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by ensuring it maintains adequate cash and available banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of the financial assets and liabilities.
Due to the nature of its investments PPP projects the timing of cash outows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Group.
The Groups liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows in major currencies and assuming the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
01 Overview 02 Strategic Report 03 Corporate Governance 04 Financial Statements 05 Additional Information Annual Report 2016 75.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Company, its intermediate holding companies or its PPP project companies will default on the contractual obligations they entered into.
Credit risk is subsumed within the overall Companys performance risk.
The Company, its 100% owned direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies rely on the performance of their main counterparties where credit risk arises, mainly from the Group's investments in PPP projects.
The performance risk arises from the PPP investments inability to pay the forecast distributions as the Group relies on its PPP investments project companies to perform adequately and return the expected yields.
Several factors could hinder this ability such as poor operational performance, exceptional expenditures, major maintenance overspend or an event that would affect the PPP project companys cover ratios.
The Group's PPP investments are also dependent on the performance of their main operational contractors.
The Group regularly monitors the contractors' concentration and financial strength.
The Directors and Investment Adviser regularly assess the returns forecast from PPP investments through the update of cash ow forecasts and by monitoring the operational and financial performance of these investments with regular performance meetings.
The Group's PPP investments' project companies receive regular, long-term, index-linked revenue from government departments, public-sector or local authority clients or directly from the public via real tolls, providing a stable and low-risk income stream.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group mitigates its risk on cash investments and derivative transactions by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies a minimum of Standard and Poors A-1.
The Directors believe that the Group is not signicantly exposed to credit risk and that its investments' underlying risks are monitored and sufciently mitigated for the investments to deliver the expected return to the Group.
The Directors have considered the above factors and the discount rate sensitivities disclosed in note 10 and does not consider it appropriate to present a separate analysis of credit risk.
Market risk ination risk Each of the Groups PPP investments will typically have part of its revenue and costs linked to a specic ination index at inception of the project.
In most cases this creates a natural hedge, meaning a derivative does not need to be entered into in order to mitigate ination risk.
However, in a minority of cases where the investment has index-linked cash ows that fall outside of this natural hedge, the ination risk is hedged using RPI ination swaps.
For a sensitivity analysis of investments at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 10.
Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company has one investment in its direct subsidiary, JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. which has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through holding Euro cash balances and contracting with service providers paid in Euro.
The level of these balances and expenditures are marginal and do not pose a significant risk to the value recognised in the Companys Statement of Financial Position.
As at 31 December 2016, the fair value of the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. includes nine 2015: six overseas investments.
The Company and its subsidiaries foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to hedge automatically on an individual project basis but to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
At 31 December 2016, the Companys investment at fair value through profit or loss does not includes any foreign exchange forward contract 31 December 2015: nil.
The Company and its subsidiaries are mainly exposed to uctuations in the Euro, US Dollar and Canadian Dollar exchange rates.
The amount of the Companys investments fair value foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at the reporting date was as follows: Fair Value 2016 2015 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 91,651 73,219 Euro 211,357 35,254 US Dollar 91,617 394,625 108,473 JLIF Limited 76.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The following table details the Companys sensitivity to a 10% increase or decrease in Sterling against relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary items fair valued within the Companys investment in JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. and reects a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit from operations where the relevant currency weakens by 10% against Sterling.
For a 10% strengthening of the relevant currency against Sterling, there would be an approximately equal and opposite impact on profit from operations, and the negative balances below would be positive.
31 December 2016 profit Investments before tax at fair value Effect on operating profit and investments at fair value of relevant currency weakening by 10% against Sterling: 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 9,164 9,164 Euro 21,135 21,135 US Dollar 9,162 9,162 39,462 39,462 31 December 2015 profit Investments before tax at fair value Effect on operating profit and investments at fair value of relevant currency weakening by 10% against Sterling: 000s 000s Canadian Dollar 7,322 7,322 Euro 3,525 3,525 10,847 10,847 While JLIF's stated policy since launch in November 2010 has been not to hedge the balance sheet value of its non-Sterling assets, JLIF does make prudent use of foreign exchange hedging instruments to hedge non-Sterling cash ows, typically looking out up to 18 months.
Furthermore, JLIF's investment policy requires that at least 50% of the Portfolio be UK-based at any time.
JLIF is also able to draw on its revolving credit facility in the local currency and repay borrowings in the same currency from its portfolio of assets denominated in the same currency, thereby creating a natural hedge.
Market risk interest rate risk The Group's interest rate risk arises on the credit facility borrowings and oating rate deposits.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to variability of interest payment cash ows.
Each PPP investment hedges its interest rate risk at the inception of a project.
This will either be done by issuing a xed rate bond or, if the project is bank nanced, with xed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into xed rate by the use of interest rate swaps.
The uctuations in interest rates impact the return from oating rate deposits and hence the income from investments at fair value through profit or loss.
A 1% increase or decrease represents the Directors' assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.
The Group was in a net cash position and had outstanding debt of 171.4 million at the balance sheet date 31 December 2015: net cash position, 17.0 million outstanding debt.
The interest rate sensitivity of the Group's assets and liabilities does not have a material impact.
The Company held the following financial instruments at fair value at 31 December 2016.
There have been no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.

There were no Level 2 assets or liabilities during the year 2015: none.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2, Level 1 and 3 or Level 2 and 3 during the year 2015: none.
In the table above, financial instruments are held at carrying value as an approximation to fair value unless stated otherwise.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening to closing balances of the investments at fair value through profit or loss is given in note 10.
The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of Level 3 inputs, include the fair value of the Companys 100% owned subsidiary JLIF Luxco 1 S.. r. l. the intermediate holding companies and the Group's PPP investments.
The fair value of the Companys direct subsidiary and the intermediate holding companies mainly comprises cash and working capital and an outstanding loan balance of 171.4 million.
The fair values of these companies are equivalent to their Net Assets.
The Groups PPP investments are valued by discounting future cash ows from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of each discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital, is the long run average government bond rates adjusted by an appropriate premium to reect PPP specic risk, phase of the PPP project and counterparty credit risk.
The weighted average discount rate applied was 7.87% 31 December 2015: 7.82%.
The discount rate is considered the most significant unobservable input through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss.
An absolute increase of 1% in the discount rate would cause a decrease in fair value of the PPP investments of 96.7 million 31 December 2015: 65.1 million.
An absolute decrease of 1% could cause an increase in fair value of the PPP investments of 111.7 million 31 December 2015: 74.8 million.
For a sensitivity analysis of Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss, refer to note 10.
The Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements are approximately equal to their fair values.
Foreign currency and interest rate prole of financial liabilities The Company's financial liabilities at 31 December 2016 were 3.3 million 2015: 2.7 million.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS The Company has provided a guarantee under the JLIF Limited Partnerships 180 million multicurrency revolving credit facility which expires in August 2020, and under the accordion facility of 150 million which expires in June 2019.
As at 31 December 2016, 171.4 million was drawn on the facility.
The fair value of the guarantee is considered to be immaterial to the Company accounts as the probability of the guarantee being called upon is considered to be extremely unlikely.
In making this assessment, consideration has been given to the proximity of the current and forecast metrics to default.
EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE On 20 March 2017 the Company announced a proposed share issuance by way of a shareholder tap issue for up to approximately 89.8 million new ordinary shares, the maximum that can be issued via a shareholder tap issue.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to repay most of the outstanding Sterling-borrowings.

DISCLOSURE SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group holds investments in 62 service concession arrangements in the Health, Education, Justice and Emergency Services, Government Buildings, Regeneration and Social Housing, Transport and Street Lighting sectors.
The concessions vary on the obligations required, but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.

The value of these head leases is not considered to be material.
As at 31 December 2016 all of the service concessions apart from one Intercity Express Programme phase 1 were fully operational 31 December 2015: all.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specic project agreement.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operator's rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to full its requirements.
