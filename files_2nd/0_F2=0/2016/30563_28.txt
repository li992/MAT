Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Segmental analysis The Groups reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance.
All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products and building materials.
The Groups business is not highly seasonal and the Groups customer base is highly diversied, with no individually significant customer.
Canada and Central Europe represent less than 10 per cent of the Groups operating profit and do not meet other quantitative thresholds and therefore do not represent a reportable segment.
They have been reported on a combined basis and all comparatives have been restated for the purposes of consistency and comparability.
The changes in revenue and trading profit for continuing operations between the years ended 31 July 2015 and 31 July 2016 include changes in exchange rates, disposals, acquisitions and organic change.
Where businesses are disposed in the year, the difference between the revenue and trading profit in the current year up to the date of disposal and the revenue and trading profit in the equivalent portion of the prior year is included in organic change.
Revenue by reportable segment for continuing operations is as follows: Organic 2015 Exchange Disposals Acquisitions change 2016 Analysis of change in revenue m m m m m m USA 8,343 569 6 173 377 9,456 UK 1,987 53 44 1,996 Nordic 1,864 3 1 5 10 1,881 Canada and Central Europe 1,138 20 25 14 10 1,097 Group 13,332 552 32 245 333 14,430 Trading profit loss note 9 by reportable segment for continuing operations is as follows: Organic 2015 Exchange Disposals Acquisitions change 2016 Analysis of change in trading profit loss note 9 m m m m m m USA 681 47 2 3 42 775 UK 90 1 17 74 Nordic 71 12 59 Canada and Central Europe 55 1 2 3 53 Central and other costs 43 2 45 Group 854 46 268 916 The reconciliation between trading profit loss note 9 and operating profit loss by reportable segment for continuing operations is as follows: 2016 2015 Amortisation Amortisation and and impairment impairment of acquired of acquired Trading Exceptional intangible Operating Trading Exceptional intangible Operating profit loss items assets profit loss profit loss items assets profit loss m m m m m m m m USA 775 2 34 743 681 6 27 660 UK 74 9 106 41 90 2 13 79 Nordic 59 2 5 56 71 2 249 180 Canada and Central Europe 53 2 51 55 9 5 41 Central and other costs 45 3 42 43 1 44 Group 916 2 147 767 854 4 294 556 Finance income 1 Finance costs 40 49 profit before tax 727 508 Wolseley plc 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 2 Segmental analysis continued In 2015 and 2016, a number of Group businesses or groups of branches have been disposed of, closed or are classied as held for sale.

Year four is calculated as the average ofthe final year of the strategic plan and year ves mid-cycle estimate.
The other inputs include a risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of each country and the 30-year long-term growth rate by country, as published by the IMF in April 2016.
The strategic plan is developed based on analyses of sales, markets and costs at a regional level.
Consideration is given to past events, knowledge of future contracts and the wider economy.
It takes into account both current business and future initiatives.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis across all CGUs which have goodwill and acquired intangible assets using the following key impairment review assumptions: compound average revenue growth rate, post-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate, keeping all other assumptions constant.
UK The impairment review for the UK has resulted in an impairment charge in the year of 94 million.
In allocating the impairment charge we have considered the impairment of all assets as well as goodwill.
An impairment trigger arose for the UK businesses due to the continuing challenging market conditions and uncertainty over performance.
Expectations of future profitability for the UK businesses were therefore signicantly reduced, resulting in impairment charges for Plumb, Parts & Drain, Pipe & Climate, Infrastructure and Soak.
com business was acquired in February 2015 and has incurred losses despite generating good revenue growth.
We do expect the business to generate future profits and it remains an important part of the Groups European B2C strategy but due to the uncertainty of the timing of profitability an impairment charge has been made against the carrying value of its goodwill.

Accordingly the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have predominantly been calculated based on a 19 per cent tax rate which materially reects the rate for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse.
A further change to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Chancellors Budget on 16 March 2016 to reduce the standard rate to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
As this change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date its effects are not included in these financial statements.
The overall effect of this further rate change, if it had applied to the UK deferred tax balances at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax assets balance by 3 million and to increase the tax expense by the same amount.
Deferred tax assets in the UK have been recognised on the basis that the UK is forecast to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to enable these to be utilised.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 68 million 2015: 77 million that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The losses are in the UK relating to capital disposals and France relating to asset impairments that have not been recognised on the basis that France is not forecasting to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise them.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
However, tax may arise on 253 million 2015: 200 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The fair value adjustment arose before 30 November 2011 when the loan notes were hedged by a series of interest rate swaps.
From 30 November 2011, the hedge relationship wasde-designated and the fair value adjustment is being released to the income statement on an amortised cost basis and the fair value hedge is based on a recalculated effective interest rate at the date when hedge accounting was discontinued.
The adjustment will be fully amortised at the point the unsecured loan notes mature.
There have been no significant changes during the year to the Groups policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of financial instruments.
These policies are summarised on pages 106 to 113.
22 Financial instruments and financial risk management Capital structure To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure based on current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items.
The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio remains within 1 to 2 times.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.
The reconciliation of opening to closing net debt is detailed in note 31.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity During the year ended 31 July 2016, the Groups 800 million revolving credit facility has been extended by one year and matures in September 2021.
As at 31 July 2016, 95 million was drawn under the 800 million facility and the US$600 million trade receivables facility was undrawn.
The Groups undrawn facilities are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Less than one year Between one and two years Between two and three years 454 Between three and four years Between four and five years Greater than five years 705 680 Total 1,159 680 On 1 September 2015 the Group issued US$800 million of US Private Placement bonds at an average xed interest rate of 3.7 per cent in three tranches: US$250 million expiring in September 2022, US$400 million expiring in September 2025 and US$150 million expiring in September 2027.
As at 31 July 2016 exchange rates, these bonds translate to 605 million comprising of 189 million, 303 million and 113 million tranches, respectively.

This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2016 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient cover for the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, theamount of performing insurance cover signicantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash ow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Due to the nature of these provisions, the timing of any settlements is uncertain.
Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims andclaims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group principally USA casualty and global property damage.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash ows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.
Other provisions include warranty costs relating to businesses disposed of, rental commitments on vacant properties and dilapidations onleased properties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.

For executive share option plans and all-employee sharesave plans, the range of exercise prices for shares and options outstanding at 31 July 2016 was 7.01 to 33.62 2015: 7.01 to 33.62.
For the ordinary share plan and long term incentive plans, all share options outstanding at 31 July 2016 had an exercise price of nil 2015: nil.
For shares and options outstanding at 31 July 2016, the weighted average remaining contractual life was four years 2015: four years.
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated using the binomial methodology for all plans except the portion of the grants awarded under the long term incentive plan that are subject to a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used.
The fair value of shares granted under the ordinary share plan for more information please refer to page 113 was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Long term Executive share options Employee share options incentive plans 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Risk free interest rate n a 1.6% 0.6% 0.8% 0.7% 1.0% Expected dividend yield n a 3.3% 2.7% 2.5% 2.2% 0.0% Expected volatility n a 32% 25% 22% 23% 23% Expected life n a 5.7 years 1-6 years 1-6 years 3 years 3 years There were no executive share options granted in the period.
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historical volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due to the Groups capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.
The principal assumptions for the ordinary share plan are an expected dividend yield of approximately 3.0 per cent and an expected life of three years.

The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the Group has gained access and additional profitability and operating efficiencies available in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed 110 million to revenue, 6 million to trading profit and 6 million to the Groups operating profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
It is not practicable to disclose profit before and after tax, as the Group manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.

It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, asstated above.
It is also not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would havebeen acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

34 Contingent liabilities Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, among other things, the products that we supply, contractual and commercial disputes and disputes with employees.
Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise.
In the case of unfavourable outcomes, the Group may benefit from applicable insurance protection.
Warranties and indemnities in relation to business disposals Over the past few years, the Group has disposed of a number of non-core businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and indemnities to acquirers and other third parties.
Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability is likely to crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provision has been made could crystallise in the future.
Group companies have also made contractual commitments for certain property and other obligations which could be called upon in an event of default.
As at the dateofthis report, there are no significant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals.
Environmental liabilities The operations of certain Group companies are subject tospecic environmental regulations.
From time to time, the Group conducts preliminary investigations through third parties to assess potential risks including potential soil or groundwater contamination of sites.
Where an obligation to remediate contamination arises then this is provided for, though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision is made.
Outcome of claims and litigation The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are unclear, further time is needed to assess properly the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
35 Post-balance sheet events In August 2016, the Group acquired two businesses for total consideration of 187 million with combined annualised revenue of 92 million.
Clawfoot Supply, LLC trading as Signature Hardware is a B2C distributor of high-end, private label products.
100 per cent of this company was acquired to grow B2C and online presence in the USA.
The Group also acquired the net assets of Westeld Lighting.
As at the date of this report, the accounting for these acquisitions has not been nalised.
In September 2016, we completed a six month review of our operational strategy in the UK and expect to reduce the number of operational locations and employees by at least 10 per cent.
Restructuring costs in relation to these actions will continue into the next financial year.

Fair value measurements can be classied in the following hierarchy: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : and inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.

No transfers between levels occurred during the current or prior year.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Groups other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value.
Other receivables include an amount of 60 million 2015: 48 million which has been discounted at a rate of 1.5 per cent 2015: 2.2 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.
Because other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear oating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values.
The only non-current financial assets or liabilities for which fair value does not approximate to book value are the senior unsecured loan notes, which had a book value of 959 million 2015: 453 million and a fair value of 1,027 million 2015: 474 million.

Financial instruments: risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well-dened policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2015.
By the nature of its business, the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to the operating businesses.
There has been no change since the previous year in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period underreview, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash ows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Wolseley plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financials Other information 36 Additional information continued ii Additional information about financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outows excluding interest income and income from derivatives including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that oating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date and cash ows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash ows can be analysed by maturity as follows: 2016 2015 Trade and Trade and other Interest other Interest payables Debt on debt Total payables Debt on debt Total As at 31 July m m m m m m m m Due in less than one year 2,280 5 44 2,329 1,976 141 31 2,148 Due in one to two years 19 122 40 181 15 3 37 55 Due in two to three years 12 2 37 51 11 103 34 148 Due in three to four years 14 1 37 52 72 31 40 Due in four to five years 8215 31 254 91 31 41 Due in over five years 110 847 116 1,073 83 814 113 1,010 Total 2,443 1,192 305 3,940 2,101 1,064 277 3,442 Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 65 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars.
Within each country it operates, the Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash ow exposures.
However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts orcurrency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only a temporary effect.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated materially to match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets for the principal currencies used by the Group are shown in the five-year summary on page 123.
The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by 552 million 2015: increase by 101 million and to increase trading profit by 46 million 2015: increase by 19 million.
These currency effects primarily reect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, euro and Canadian dollars as follows: 2016 2015 Weakening Weakening strengthening strengthening of sterling of sterling US dollars 6.8% 5.3% Euro 0.8% 9.0% Canadian dollars 4.1% 5.2% The Group has net financial liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net investment in its overseas subsidiaries.
The principal value of those financial liabilities designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was 1,636 million 2015: 1,000 million.
The loss on translation of these financial instruments into sterling of 107 million 2015: loss of 46 million has been taken to the translation reserve.
Net investment hedging Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity.
Gains and losses on those hedging instruments designated as hedges of the net investments in foreign operations are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective: these amounts are included in exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as stated in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness are recognised immediately in the income statement for the period.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.

The Groups subsidiary undertakings are set out on pages 124 and 125.
For the UK plan, the strategy is to invest approximately 70 per cent of the assets in growth assets comprising 50 per cent in equities and 20per cent in other diversied growth assets and 30 per cent in bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the plan trustees in consultation with the Company.
For the overseas plans the investment strategy involves the investment in dened levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.
Investment risk The present value of the UK dened benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the actual return on plan assets is below this rate, it will decrease a net surplus or increase a net pension liability.
Currently, the plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and property.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equity securities to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the UK plan liability and this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the dened benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the UK plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
