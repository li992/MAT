Note 2: Basis of preparation The Parent Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and were approved for issue on 21 March 2017.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements are presented in US Dollars US$, the Companys functional currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
The functional currency is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The majority of the Companys operating activities are conducted in US Dollars.
The Company does not have any other employee than the Directors.
The requirement to give employee numbers and costs information under Section 411 of the Companies Act is addressed in the Directors Remuneration Report of the Group on page 69.
Note 3: Significant accounting policies Foreign currencies The Companys functional currency and presentation currency is US Dollars.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Investments Equity investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provision for impairments.
Financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets or financial liabilities are added from its fair value except for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
For those financial assets and financial liabilities, the transactions costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
FERREXPO PLC 15 3 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 3: Significant accounting policies continued All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i. e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are those that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The subsequent measurement is based on the classification of the financial instruments.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired along with the amortisation process.
Other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
The Company has not designated any financial asset as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss of an asset carried at amortised cost decreases and it is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is to be reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantee liabilities issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss, which incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantees provided are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amortisation recognised as guarantee fee in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Note 8 to the financial statements provides further information on the composition of the financial instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Treasury share reserve Own equity instruments which are re-acquired treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity shown in the treasury share reserve.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
15 4 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 3: Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the grant date using modelling techniques consistent with the mathematics underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model extended to allow for the performance conditions.
The fair value is determined by reference to the quoted closing share price on the grant date.
The cost is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, except for market conditions, such as the relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Where the vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of certain market conditions, a vesting charge is recognised irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where awards terminate before the performance period is complete, any unamortised expense is recognised immediately.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense of outstanding awards is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in employee benefit trust reserve in equity.
All costs related to the share-based payments of the Group are recorded in a subsidiary undertaking of the Company.
Notes 11 to the financial statements provides further information on the share-based payments and the costs recorded.
Employee benefit trust reserve Ferrexpo plc shares held by the Company are classified in capital and reserves as employee benefit trust reserves and recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale issue or cancellation of equity shares.
New standards and interpretations adopted The accounting policies and method of computation adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those of the previous year, except for the adoption of new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations effective as of 1 January 2016.
The new standards and interpretations had no effect on reported results, financial position or disclosure in the financial statements: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements disclosure initiative Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The Company has elected not to early adopt the following revised and amended standard, which is not yet mandatory in the EU.

Note 6: Other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings Other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings at 31 December 2016 relate to the following: US$000 At 31.12.16 At 31.12.15 Non-current other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings Other receivables 2,015 4,458 Total non-current other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings 2,015 4,458 Current other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings Loans 852,890 837,584 Other receivables 16,977 13,281 Total current other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings 869,867 850,865 Total other receivables due from subsidiary undertakings 871,882 855,323 The Company provided a loan to its subsidiary Ferrexpo AG without a fixed repayment date and the loan is repayable on call and thus classified as current.
Other receivables due from subsidiaries are related to the financial guarantees provided by the Company and reflect the future guarantee fee receivable recorded when the financial guarantees were recognised as a liability.
15 6 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 7: Financial guarantees The Companys policy is to provide financial guarantees under limited circumstances only for the benefit of wholly owned or substantially owned subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2016, the Company was a guarantor to the Groups outstanding Eurobond totalling US$346,385 thousand issued by Ferrexpo Finance plc and to the new syndicated pre-export finance facility totalling US$350,000 thousand drawn by Ferrexpo Finance plc and Ferrexpo AG.
The amortisation of this facility commenced in November 2016 with eight quarterly instalments of US$43,750 thousand to the final maturity date of 8 August 2018.
The outstanding Eurobond is repayable in two equal instalments of US$173,193 thousand falling due on 7 April 2018 and 2019.
The Company earns a guarantee fee from its subsidiaries for the financial guarantees provided in respect of the Groups finance facilities mentioned above.
Note 8: Financial risk management objectives and policies The Companys principal financial instruments comprise a loan granted to a subsidiary undertaking and financial guarantees provided in respect of the Eurobond and major bank debt facilities issued and drawn by subsidiary undertakings.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is the concentration risk counterparty and country.
The Companys exposure to interest rate risk is limited to interest income on a loan granted to a subsidiary undertaking with a variable interest rate.
Interest rates on borrowings to Group undertakings are determined after due consideration of potential external funding costs of the respective Group undertakings in their available financial market.
The Company is exposed to transactional currency exposure.
Such exposure arises from costs being incurred in a currency other than the functional currency of US Dollar, mainly the Euro and the Swiss Franc.
The Company does not hedge against currency risk due to the values involved, but continues to monitor the situation closely.
All financial assets and liabilities of the Company are initially measured at fair value.
The subsequent measurement is at amortised cost.
Fair values Except for the financial guarantees, the Directors are of the opinion that the carrying amounts of the financial assets and financial liabilities are approximately equal to their fair values due to the short maturity, whereas the fair value of the financial guarantees is expected to be equal to the carrying amount due to currently low probability of payments to be made under the guarantee contract.
Capital management The Group manages capital on a Group basis.
For details of the capital management policies please refer to the Ferrexpo plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016. Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: US$000 At 31.12.16 At 31.12.15 Cash and cash equivalents 47 78 Accrued interest due from subsidiary undertakings 2,360 2,061 Accrued interest due from third parties 291 200 Loans due from subsidiary undertakings 852,890 837,584 Other current receivables due from subsidiary undertakings 16,977 13,281 Other non-current receivables due from subsidiary undertakings 2,015 4,458 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 874,580 857,662 The balance of other current receivables and loans due from subsidiary undertakings could potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk.
There were no impairment losses in either period.

This assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Swiss Franc 4 4 Other currencies 24 7 Total 28 11 A 5% weakening of the US Dollar against the above currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Interest rate risk The interest receivable profile for financial assets is all current as of 31 December 2016.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Company does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, and the Company does not hold any derivatives e. g. interest rate swaps.
Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.
Cash flow sensitivity for fixed and variable rate instruments An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Net finance charge 8,529 1 A decrease of 100 basis points would have a negative effect of US$4,201 thousand 2015: US$1 thousand, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Note 9: Share capital and reserves Share capital Share capital represents the nominal value on issue of the Companys equity share capital, comprising 0.10 Ordinary Shares.
