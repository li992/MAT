Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 92 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 8 Pensions continued 8.5 Funding The CARE Schemes and the RSP are funded schemes to which both employees and the Group contribute.
The Morrison Scheme is entirely funded by the parent Company and the Safeway Scheme is funded by Safeway Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Groups subsidiaries participate in the RSP.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost between the parent Company and its subsidiaries.
The contribution of each participating subsidiary to the RSP is calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The current best estimate of Group contributions to be paid for the accounting period commencing 31 January 2016 is 67m.
This estimate includes amounts payable from the SLP and salary sacrificed contributions from employees.
8.6 Closure of CARE Schemes to future accrual In July 2015, the Group reached an agreement with the trustees of the CARE Schemes to close the Schemes to future accrual.
The financial effect of this is to reduce the Groups exposure to future volatility, increases in pension liabilities and cost.
Subsequently, the Group has entered into an agreement to contribute additional assets into the SLP.
For further details of this agreement see note 8.3.
8.7 Defined contribution scheme set up costs As previously announced the Group intends to open a new defined contribution pension scheme for colleagues.
This scheme will become the Auto Enrolment scheme and as such the Group will be liable for backdated contributions for eligible colleagues to 1 October 2012.
The estimated set up costs relating to backdated contributions for the period 1 October 2012 to 31 January 2016 is 35m.
9 Share-based payments 9.1 Accounting policy Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value of the share-based award is calculated at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
This is based on the Groups estimate of share options that will eventually vest.
This takes into account movement of non-market conditions, being service conditions and financial performance, if relevant.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of a binomial stochastic model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The charge in the period for share-based payments was 11m 2015: 11m.
9.2 Share save schemes The Share save scheme began in May 2000 and all employees including Executive Directors are eligible once the necessary service requirements have been met.
The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 350 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is subject only to service conditions.
The schemes that launched in May 2011 and subsequently are under the new scheme rules approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
Annual report and financial statements 2015 16 93 9 Share-based payments continued 9.2 Share save schemes continued The fair value of options granted, and the inputs used to determine it are as follows: Grant date 19 May 2015 20 May 2014 13 May 2013 14 May 2012 Share price at grant date 1.81 2.10 2.83 2.79 Fair value of options granted 4.8m 11.6m 8.1m 9.1m Exercise price 1.64 1.64 2.25 2.36 Dividend yield 5.15% 6.21% 4.17% 3.69% Annual risk free interest rate 1.06% 1.00% 0.45% 0.53% 1 Expected volatility 22.7% 18.3% 16.8% 19.4% 1 The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Share save plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The discount is determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The awards have no exercise price and accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period.
LTIP grants issued before 2013 are subject to the performance conditions, as stated below.
Since 2013, the performance conditions apply to Executive Committee members only.
Senior employees eligible for LTIPs have to satisfy a service condition only.
Given the size of the Executive Committee, the fair value of the LTIP grants assumes no leavers.
The leavers assumptions below relate to the senior employees only.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date, provided the relevant performance criteria have been met.
