Significant judgements and estimates While estimating provisions requires judgement, in the majority of cases the range of reasonably possible outcomes is narrow.
In one instance management has taken a judgement over a material warranty matter, having assessed internal legal advice and given due consideration to an ongoing commercial relationship.
When establishing the amount to record for a provision of this nature, estimates of product volume and likely cost of rectification, including the potential for penalties, are taken into account.
After consideration of sensitivity analysis, amounts stated represent managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Contract provisions The Group has a small number of onerous contracts and a non-beneficial lease arrangement, primarily arising on business combinations and contractual dispute matters.
Onerous contracts relate to customer programmes where the unavoidable costs of delivering product are in excess of contracted sales prices.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 3 million in 2018 and 19 million from 2019.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customers associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 13 million in 2018 and 17 million from 2019.
Claims and litigation Claims provisions are held in the Groups captive insurance company and amount to 11 million 2015: 9 million.
Claims provisions and charges are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice.
Legal provisions amounting to 6 million 2015: 23 million relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that have arisen in the normal course of business or taken on as a result of a business combination.
Further details of legal matters are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Groups stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent managements view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts of 8 million 2015: 5 million are provided.
Utilisation of the claims and litigation provision due in more than one year is estimated as 5 million in 2018 and 4 million from 2019.
