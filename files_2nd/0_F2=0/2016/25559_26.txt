Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Accounting Policies These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The amendments to FRS 101 2014 15 Cycle issued in July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
Under section s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In these financial statements, the company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a Cash Flow Statement and related notes: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: and disclosures of compensation of Key Management Personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments: and certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Investments Investments are held at fair value through profit and loss vision for impairment in value and are held for longterm investment purposes.
The valuation methods applied are the same as those at the Group level: details of which can be found in note 1 to the Groups financial accounts on page 109 to 111.
Intercompany loans All intercompany loans are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Where intercompany loans are intended for use on a continuing basis in the Companys activities, and there is no intention of their settlement in the foreseeable future, they are presented as fixed assets.
Financial instruments Currently the Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and cease to be recognised on the basis of when the related titles pass to or from the Company.
