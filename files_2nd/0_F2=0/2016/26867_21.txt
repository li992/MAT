All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The disclosure on going concern on page 24 of the Directors Report form part of these financial statements.
b Transition to FRS 102 This set of financial statements, in accordance with the SORP includes changes arising from the adoption of FRS 102 which the Company is required to comply with for the first time for the year ended 31st January 2016.
Aside from amendments to the disclosure of fair value hierarchy information and presentational aspects relating to the Statement of Cash Flows, no significant changes have arisen from the adoption of the new standards.
Where changes have arisen, they are substantially in relation to presentation, disclosure and non-quantifiable aspects there has been no impact to financial position or financial performance and no comparative figures require restating.
c Valuation of investments The Company has chosen to adopt Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
The portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are treated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
d Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses on cash and short term deposits, realised gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, management fee and finance costs allocated to capital and any other capital charges, are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and dealt with in capital reserves within Investment holding gains.
e Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Special dividends are looked at individually to ascertain the reason behind the payment.
This will determine whether they are treated as income or capital.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
44 JPM Mercantile pp44 60 05 04 2016 16:17 Page 45 Financial Statements continued Underwriting commission is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
Underwriting commission is recognised in revenue where it relates to shares that the Company is not required to take up.
Where the Company is required to take up a proportion of the shares underwritten, the same proportion of commission received is deducted from the cost of the shares taken up, with the balance taken to revenue.
Property income distributions are taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income with the following exceptions: The management fee is allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to capital, in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
Expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 11 on page 50. g Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Finance costs are allocated 30% to revenue and 70% to capital, in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Financial instruments Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash including demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as well as cash equivalents.
Liquidity funds are considered cash equivalents as they are held for cash management purposes as an alternative to cash.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debenture in issue is classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
It was initially measured at the proceeds net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The amortisation of direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest rate method.
Bank loans are classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value.
They are initially measured as proceeds and subsequently measured at fair value.
Interest payable on the bank loan is accounted for on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For loans taken out in a currency other than the funds functional currency GBP the unrealised exchange gains or losses are accounted for in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprises forward exchange contract, the purpose of which is to manage currency risk arising from the Companys investing activities.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
i Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences, but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
j Value Added Tax VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of the related irrecoverable VAT.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method, based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.

Accounting Policies continued k Foreign currency The Company is required to identify a functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
l Dividends payable Dividends are included in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the shareholders.
m Repurchase of ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transactions costs is charged to Capital reserves and dealt with in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of Called up share capital and into Capital redemption reserve.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Companys financial statements on occasion requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the primary financial statements and the accompanying disclosures.
These assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in the current and future periods, depending on circumstance.
Management do not believe that any accounting judgements or estimates have been applied to this set of financial statements, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year 2016 2015 000 000 Overseas withholding tax 282 113 Total tax charge for the year 282 113 b Factors affecting the total tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2015: lower than the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 20.16% 2015: 21.32%.
The factors affecting the total tax charge for the year are as follows: 2016 2015 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 49,862 164,236 214,098 41,465 31,050 72,515 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 20.16% 2015: 21.32% 10,052 33,110 43,162 8,840 6,620 15,460 Effect of: Non taxable scrip dividends 121 121 Non taxable UK dividend income 9,520 9,520 8,634 8,634 Non taxable overseas dividend income 1,277 1,277 1,220 1,220 Non taxable capital gains 35,755 35,755 9,352 9,352 Unrelieved expenses 866 2,645 3,511 1,014 2,732 3,746 Overseas withholding tax 282 282 113 113 Total tax charge for the year 282 282 113 113 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 43,081,000 2015: 44,455,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 18% 2015: 20%.
The UK Government announced in July 2015 that the corporation tax rate is set to be cut to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020.
These reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax were substantively enacted on 26th October 2015 and became effective from 18th November 2015.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the financial statements.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The fair value hierarchy disclosures required by FRS 102 are given below.
The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 102 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: A Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market.
Quoted in an active market in this context means quoted prices are readily and regularly available and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted price is usually the current bid price.
B Prices of recent transactions for identical instruments When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place.
If the entity can demonstrate that the last transaction price is not a good estimate of fair value e. g. because it reflects the amount that an entity would receive or pay in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distress sale, that price is adjusted.
C Valuation techniques using observable market value If the market for the asset is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, an entity estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique.
The objective of using a valuation technique is to estimate what the transaction price would have been on the measurement date in an arms length exchange motivated by normal business considerations.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These financial risks include market risk comprising interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The Company has no significant direct exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares and other securities, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: and debentures issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises two elements interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these two elements of market risk is given in parts i and ii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits, the liquidity fund and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are reset.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Companys gearing policy is to limit gearing within the range of 10% net cash to 20% geared where gearing is defined as investments expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
Interest rate exposure The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
This debenture stock is carried in the Companys Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
The Company has no significant holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The Company does not normally hold a significantly high level of cash balances and there is an overdraft facility available when required.

Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2015: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

Under the terms of this facility, interest is payable at a rate of LIBOR as quoted on the market for the loan period plus a margin, plus Mandatory Costs, which are the lenders cost of complying with certain regulatory requirements of the Bank of England.
The facility was not utilised during the year and was undrawn at the year end 2015: same.
In the opinion of the Directors, this sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the Companys future exposure to interest rate changes due to fluctuations in the level of cash balances.
ii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,775,622 1,722,405 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
56 JPM Mercantile pp44 60 06 04 2016 12:00 Page 57 Financial Statements continued Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 to 18.
This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2015: 10% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.
2016 2015 10% Increase 10% Decrease 10% Increase 10% Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 266 266 258 258 Capital return 176,941 176,941 171,638 171,638 Total return after taxation 176,675 176,675 171,380 171,380 Net assets 176,675 176,675 171,380 171,380 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2016 More than Three three months months but not more More than or less than one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 8,198 8,198 Other creditors and accruals 292 292 1 Debenture stock interest 5,441 5,441 10,882 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year 2 Debenture stock principal 178,850 178,850 1 Debenture stock interest 147,188 147,188 13,931 5,441 326,038 345,410 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 57 JPM Mercantile pp44 60 06 04 2016 12:00 Page 58 Financial Statements continued 24.

2 Includes 3,850,000 4.25% debenture stock which is irredeemable and secured by a floating charge over the assets of the Company.
The outflow of cash in connection with the debenture stock could occur earlier if the Company were to repurchase debentures for cancellation or if the Company goes into default and the security is enforced.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash and cash equivalents Counterparties are subject to regular credit analysis by the Manager and deposits can only be placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAMs Counterparty Risk Group.
The Board regularly reviews the counterparties used by the Manager.
At the year end the cash balance of 163 million was placed across a range of suitably approved counterparties in line with the Boards concentration guidelines.
The JPMorgan Sterling Liquidity Fund has a AAA rating.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase Bank JPMorgan Chase Bank is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The custody agreement grants a general lien over the securities credited to the securities account.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chase Banks own trading assets and are therefore protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase Bank were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all of the assets of the Company.
