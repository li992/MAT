Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation This note explains how these consolidated financial statements have been prepared, including details of: an accounting policy change relating to pensions administration costs: non-GAAP performance measures: and the Directors going concern assessment.
General information Royal Mail plc the Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom UK and the consolidated financial statements are produced in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The UK is the Companys country of domicile.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 27 March 2016 2014-15 52 weeks ended 29 March 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in its associate undertakings.
The consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 27 March 2016 were authorised for issue by the Board on 18 May 2016.
Basis of preparation and accounting The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates, and all values are rounded to the nearest whole million except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historic cost basis, except for pension assets and derivative financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value.
Accounting reference date The financial reporting year ends on the last Sunday in March and, accordingly, these financial statements are prepared for the 52 weeks ended 27 March 2016 2014-15 52 weeks ended 29 March 2015.
Presentation of results and accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies, including details of new accounting standards adopted in the reporting year, can be found after the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 138.
Details of a change in accounting policy impacting the balance sheet, other comprehensive income and the statement of changes in equity in the current and comparative years are given below.
Prior year adjustment - pensions administration costs During the reporting year, a decision was taken to change Group policy in relation to pensions administration costs.
Previously an allowance for the administration costs for the relevant reporting period was included as part of the ongoing UK defined benefit pension service costs and actual costs incurred offset against the return on plans assets.
An estimate of future administration costs was also included as part of the defined benefit liability.
Under this revised policy, administration costs are now recognised as they are incurred and included only within the ongoing UK defined benefit pension service costs in the income statement.
This has had the impact of reducing the defined benefit liability at 29 March 2015 by 188 million, being the discounted value of future administration costs, and therefore increasing the net surplus by the same amount as at that date.
This policy has been adopted to better reflect the reality of the plan and the intentions of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
In line with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, this change in policy has been applied retrospectively in the Group financial statements, the impact of which is shown below.

This policy change has also had no material impact on the comparative years basic or diluted earnings per share.
Reported performance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB i. e. on a reported basis.
The notes to the financial statements have also been prepared on a reported basis unless otherwise stated.
Non-GAAP performance measures In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not required under IFRS, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, under which the Group reports.
Management believe that these non-GAAP measures assist with the understanding of the performance of the business.
These non-GAAP measures see definitions on page 140 are not a substitute, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance, but they have been disclosed as Management consider them to be an important means of comparing performance year-on-year and they include key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
Going concern In assessing the going concern status of the Group, the Directors are required to look forward by a minimum of 12 months from the signing date of these financial statements, to ensure that there is sufficient headroom to enable the Group to pay its creditors as they fall due.
The Directors have reviewed business projections and assessed these against committed and undrawn funding facilities 1,050 million at 27 March 2016 and other liquid resources available to the Group cash at bank 185 million and cash equivalent investments 170 million at 27 March 2016.
Funding facilities and cash and cash equivalents available to the Group are described in further detail in notes 18 and 21.
The Directors are satisfied that these facilities, coupled with business projections, show that the Group will continue to operate for a minimum of 12 months from the signing date of these financial statements.

Segment information The Groups revenue, costs and earnings before interest and tax are segmented in this note to align with how business performance is managed and reported to the Board.
The Groups financial performance is reported internally based on three operating segments, namely UK Parcels, International & Letters UKPIL, General Logistics Systems GLS and Other, the latter a combination, on the basis of materiality, of the two 51 per cent-owned subsidiaries Romec Limited and NDC 2000 Limited and the associate company Quadrant Catering Limited.
These operating segments, which are structured on a geographic business unit basis, report into the Chief Executives Committee and the Royal Mail plc Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Each of these units has discrete revenue, costs, profit, cash flows, assets and people.
This financial information is prepared and reviewed on a regular basis and compared with both historical and budget forecast information as part of a rigorous performance management process.
The key measure of segment performance is operating profit before transformation costs used internally for the Corporate Balanced Scorecard.
From the beginning of the reporting year 2015-16, this measure of performance is disclosed on an adjusted basis i. e. excluding specific items, which is consistent with how financial performance is now measured internally and reported to the Board.
The comparative year has been restated accordingly.
A reconciliation of the Groups adjusted to reported earnings before interest and tax and profit before tax by segment is provided below.
The majority of inter-segment revenue relates to the provision of facilities management by Romec Limited to UKPIL.
Trading between UKPIL and GLS is not material.
Transfer prices between the segments are set on the basis of charges reached through commercial negotiation with the respective business units that form each of the segments.

Current tax The current tax charge for the Group is mainly in respect of GLS.
UK taxable profits in 2015-16 are partially covered by a combination of brought forward losses and capital allowance claims.
Accordingly, the current tax rate for the Group is 17 per cent.
Effective tax rate The effective tax rate on reported profit is 17 per cent, comprising current tax due on reported profits and deferred tax in relation to temporary differences.
This rate is below the UK statutory rate, principally because of the changes to tax law detailed below, and no tax 1 charge recognised in relation to property disposals.
GLS pays tax in a number of territories, with the majority of its profits in the reporting year to 27 March 2016 earned in territories where the tax rate is above the UK statutory tax rate.
Certain subsidiaries, notably GLS France, remain unable to recognise tax credits on losses made during the reporting year.
The effect of this is partially offset by the initial recognition of tax losses in GLS Spain.
These factors contribute to GLS having a higher effective tax rate for the year than the UK statutory rate.
1 No tax charge has been recognised on property disposals included in specific items, as no tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the grounds that, were the assets into which the gains have been rolled to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise 102 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 7.

This decrease in the liability is primarily as a result of the deferred tax impact of the reduction in UK Corporation Tax rates by 2020.
Decreases in UK pension deferred tax assets are broadly offset by a reduction in capital allowance and loss assets.
The movement in pensions temporary differences credited to Other Comprehensive Income includes a credit of 48 million 2014-15 nil relating to the change in tax law detailed below.
Additionally a credit of 59 million 2014-15 1 million has been recognised in relation to the IFRIC 14 adjustment detailed in Note 10.
GLS has deferred tax assets and liabilities in various jurisdictions which cannot be offset against one another.
The main element of the liability relates to goodwill and intangibles in GLS Germany, for which the Group has already taken tax deductions.
The initial recognition of tax losses in GLS Spain has contributed to the increase in deferred tax assets.
At 27 March 2016, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of 68 million 2014-15 68 million comprising 62 million 2014-15 61 million relating to tax losses of 234 million 2014-15 227 million, mainly in GLS, that are available for offset against future profits if generated in the relevant companies, and 6 million 2014-15 7 million in relation to 30 million 2014-15 33 million of UK capital losses carried forward.
The Group has not recognised these deferred tax assets on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain of its capacity to utilise them in the future.
The Group also has temporary differences in respect of 211 million 2014-15 295 million of capital losses, the tax effect of which is 38 million 2014-15 59 million in respect of assets previously qualifying for industrial buildings allowances.
Further temporary differences exist in relation to 217 million 2014-15 308 million of gains for which rollover relief has been claimed, the tax effect of which is 40 million 2014-15 62 million.
No tax liability would be expected to crystallise on the basis that, were the assets into which the gains have been rolled to be sold at their residual values, no capital gain would arise.

Taxation continued Changes to UK corporation tax rate Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18 per cent effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
In future, this will reduce the Group's current tax charge accordingly.
In accordance with accounting standards, the effect of these rate reductions on deferred tax balances has been reflected in these financial statements, dependent upon when temporary differences are expected to reverse.
In his budget of 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 17 per cent effective 1 April 2020.
This will supersede the rate of 18 per cent already enacted.
This announced reduction in rate is not expected to significantly affect the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group.

Retirement benefit plans In applying IAS 19, the Group has recognised a pension asset of 3,430 million at 27 March 2016, compared with 3,367 million at 29 March 2015.
This note includes the key assumptions used in determining the pension asset and also provides details of the pension surplus on an actuarial basis.

They represent the cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll 2015-16 29.8 per cent: 2014-15 23.6 per cent of the increase in the defined benefit obligation due to members earning one more years worth of pension benefits.
They are calculated in accordance with IAS 19 and are based on market yields high quality corporate bonds and inflation at the beginning of the reporting year.
The 111 million increase in costs is mainly as a result of the increased pension service cost rate.
Pensions administration costs for the RMPP of 6 million 2014-15 6 million continue to be included within the ongoing UK pension service costs 2 At the beginning of August 2015, PSE was introduced under which eligible employees who are enrolled into PSE opt out of making employee contributions to their pension and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in basic pay.
As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 99 million 2014-15 nil in the reporting year 3 The employer contribution cash flow rate 17.1 per cent in both the current and prior year forms part of the payroll expense and is paid into the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP RM section.
The contribution rate is set following each actuarial funding valuation, usually every three years.
These actuarial valuations are required to be carried out on assumptions determined by the Trustee and agreed by Royal Mail Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 | 105 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10.
Retirement benefit plans continued UK Defined Contribution plan Royal Mail Group Limited, the Companys main operating subsidiary, operates the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan, which was launched in April 2009 and is open to employees who joined the Group from 31 March 2008, following closure of the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP to new members.
Ongoing UK defined contribution plan costs have increased from 38 million in 2014-15 to 63 million including 18 million PSE costs.
This is mainly due to the introduction of PSE, but also as a result of the continued increase in plan membership and an increase in the average employers contribution rate from 5.4 per cent in 2014-15 to 5.7 per cent in 2015-16.
UK Defined Benefit plans Royal Mail Group Limited had one of the largest defined benefit pension plans in the UK based on membership and assets, called the RMPP.
On 1 April 2012 one week into the 2012-13 reporting year after the granting of State Aid approval by the European Commission to HM Government on 21 March 2012 almost all of the historic pension liabilities and pension assets of RMPP, built up until 31 March 2012, were transferred to a new HM Government pension scheme, the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme RMSPS.
On this date, RMPP was also sectionalised, with Royal Mail Group Limited and Post Office Limited each responsible for their own sections from 1 April 2012 onwards.
The transfer left the Royal Mail section RM section of the RMPP fully funded on an actuarial basis.
On this basis, using long-term actuarial assumptions agreed at that date, it was predicted the Group would have to make no further cash deficit correction payments relating to the historic liabilities.
All further references in this note to the RMPP, relate to its RM section.
Pensions Reform In June 2013, the Group began a consultation with RMPP members on a proposal to ensure the RMPP could remain open to future accrual, subject to certain conditions, at least until the conclusion of the next periodic review in March 2018.
Subsequently on 26 September 2013, the Group agreed with the RMPP Trustee to implement a Pensions Reform with effect from 1 April 2014.
The agreed changes due to the Pensions Reform were considered to be a Plan amendment which met the IAS 19 definition of a past service cost, and as such a 1,350 million credit was recognised in the Group income statement as a specific item in the year ended 30 March 2014.
Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP The RMPP is funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds.
RMPP includes sections A, B and C, each with different terms and conditions: Section A is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined before 1 December 1971: Section B is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1 December 1971 and before 1 April 1987, or for members of Section A who chose to receive Section B benefits: and Section C is for members or beneficiaries of members who joined on or after 1 April 1987 and before 1 April 2008.
Benefits provided are based on final salary in respect of service to 31 March 2008, and on career salary blocks for each year of service, revalued annually, for service from 1 April 2008.
Following the conclusion of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the regular future service contribution rate for RMPP, expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, remained at 17.1 per cent.
As the valuation showed the RMPP to be in surplus, no deficit correction payments are currently being made by the Group.
The Group expects to contribute around 343 million to the RMPP in respect of normal cash service costs in 2016-17.
As part of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the Group agreed to pay additional contributions of up to 50 million each year from April 2016 onwards if the Trustee considers these necessary to maintain the Plans projected funding position in March 2019.
Until the Trustee has carried out its assessment of liabilities at March 2016 and presented the results to the Group, it is not known whether any payment will become due for 2016-17.
Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP Royal Mail Group Limited also contributes to a smaller defined benefit plan for executives, RMSEPP which closed in December 2012 to future accrual, therefore the Group makes no regular future service contributions.
As agreed in the February 2013 Funding Agreement with the Trustee, the Group makes deficit correction payments of 10 million per annum until at least the date on which the March 2018 valuation is completed no later than 30 September 2018.
Deficit correction payments in 2015-16 were 10 million 2014-15 10 million.
A liability of 2 million 2014-15 2 million has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director.

Retirement benefit plans continued Accounting and actuarial surplus position RMPP and RMSEPP Accounting IAS 19 Actuarial cash funding At 27 March At 29 March At 31 March At 31 March 5 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m 4 Fair value of plans assets 10 b below 7,374 6,619 7,442 6,462 5 Present value of plans liabilities 3,815 3,237 5,665 4,669 5 Surplus in plans pre IFRIC 14 adjustment 3,559 3,382 1,777 1,793 IFRIC 14 adjustment 129 15 n a n a 5 Surplus in plans 3,430 3,367 1,777 1,793 There is no element of the present value of the plans liabilities above that arises from plans that are wholly unfunded.
As the Group has a legal right to benefit from a surplus, under IAS 19 and IFRIC 14 it is required to recognise the economic benefit it is assumed it will derive either in the form of a reduction to future contributions or a refund of the surplus.
At the half year, the RMPP surplus was no longer assumed to be fully recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions.
At that time, the economic benefit resulting from comparing the future service costs to the employer contributions was less than the accounting surplus.
This remains the case at 27 March 2016 and the amount of surplus no longer assumed to be recoverable as a reduction to future employer contributions is assumed to be available as a refund as per IFRIC 14 and, as such, is shown net of taxation withheld.
As RMSEPP is closed to future accrual, the surplus is assumed to be available as a refund as per IFRIC 14 and, as such, is shown net of taxation withheld in both periods.
The Directors do not believe that the current excess of pension plan assets over the liabilities on an accounting basis will result in an excess of pension assets on an actuarial cash funding basis.
However, the Directors are required to account for the pension plan based on their legal right to benefit from a surplus, using long-term actuarial assumptions current at the reporting date, as required by IFRS.
The actuarial cash funding surplus of 1,777 million at 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 1,793 million surplus allows the RMPP to remain open for the benefit of the members at least until March 2018, subject to certain conditions as part of the Pensions Reform agreement, without requiring either the Group or individuals to make unaffordable increases to their cash contributions.
The funding liabilities have increased more than the accounting liabilities since they are calculated by reference to gilt yields which have fallen slightly, whereas corporate bond yields, on which the accounting liabilities are calculated have increased.
However, this is mostly offset by the difference in the market value of asset movements which, because of the different year end dates, have increased more on a funding basis than on an accounting basis.
The following disclosures relate to the major assumptions, sensitivities, assets and liabilities in the RMPP and RMSEPP.
a Major long-term assumptions used for accounting IAS 19 purposes - RMPP and RMSEPP The major assumptions used to calculate the accounting position of the pension plans are as follows: At 27 March At 29 March 2016 2015 Retail Price Index RPI 3.0% 3.1% Consumer Price Index CPI 2.0% 2.1% Discount rate nominal 3.5% 3.5% 6 real nominal less RPI 0.5% 0.4% 7 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of increase for deferred pensions CPI CPI Rate of pension increases RMPP Sections A B CPI CPI 7 Rate of pension increases RMPP Section C RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Rate of pension increases RMSEPP members transferred from Section A or B of RMPP CPI CPI 7 Rate of pension increases RMSEPP all other members RPI0.1% RPI0.1% Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old male RMPP member 29 27 years 29 27 years Life expectancy from age 60 for a current 40 60 year old female RMPP member 32 30 years 32 30 years 4 Difference between accounting and actuarial cash funding asset fair values arises from the different year end dates used for the valuation of the assets under both methods 5 Restated at 29 March 2015 for change in accounting policy relating to pensions administration costs see Note 1 6 The real discount rate used reflects the long average duration of the RMPP of around 27 years 7 The rate of increase in salaries, and the rate of pension increase for Section C members who joined RMPP on or after April 1987 and RMSEPP all other members, is capped at five per cent, which results in the average long-term pension increase assumption being 10 basis points lower than the RPI long-term assumption Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 | 107 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10.
Retirement benefit plans continued Mortality The mortality assumptions for RMPP are based on the latest Self-Administered Pension Scheme SAPS S1 mortality tables with appropriate scaling factors 106 per cent for male pensioners and 101 per cent for female pensioners.
Future improvements are based on the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term trend of 1.25 per cent per annum.
Sensitivity analysis for RMPP liabilities The RMPP liabilities are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
The potential impact of the largest sensitivities on the RMPP liabilities is as follows: Potential Increase in liabilities Key assumption change m Additional one year of life expectancy 110 Increase in inflation rate both RPI and CPI simultaneously of 0.1% p. a.
90 Decrease in discount rate of 0.1% p. a.
90 Increase in CPI assumption assuming RPI remains constant of 0.1% p. a.
20 This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on a method that assesses the impact on the defined benefit obligation, resulting from reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting year.
Changes inverse to those in the table e. g. an increase in discount rate would have the opposite effect on liabilities.
The average duration of the RMPP obligation is 27 years 2014-15 30 years.
4 billion 2014-15 3.7 billion of HM Government Bonds are primarily included in the Unit Trusts values above.
The plans assets do not include property or assets used by the Group, but do include shares of Royal Mail plc with an approximate market value of 27,000 at 27 March 2016 at 29 March 2015 17,000.
Risk exposure and investment strategy The investment strategy of the RMPP Trustee aims to safeguard the assets of the Plan and to provide, together with contributions, the financial resource from which benefits are paid.
Investment is inevitably exposed to risks.
The investment risks inherent in the investment markets are partially mitigated by pursuing a widely diversified approach across asset classes and investment managers.
The RMPP uses derivatives such as swaps, forwards and options to reduce risks whilst maintaining expected investment returns.
The RMPP Trustee recognises that there is a natural conflict between improving the potential for positive return and limiting the potential for poor return.
The RMPP Trustee has specified objectives for the investment policy that balance these requirements.
The largest risks faced by the Plan are movements in interest rates and inflation rates.
To reduce the risk of movements in these rates driving the Plan into a funding deficit, and the Group not being able to maintain its March 2018 commitment, the Trustee has hedged in advance a significant proportion of the funding liabilities which it is estimated will build up by March 2018.
It has done this predominantly through investment in gilts and derivatives interest rate and inflation rate swaps held in Unit Trust pooled investments providing economic exposure to gilts.
The impact of the Plans advance hedging of projected funding liabilities is to increase near term volatility in the pension surplus due to the return on the liability-hedging assets not being matched by an increase in the accrued liabilities.
As the accrued liabilities get closer to the projected liabilities that have been hedged, this volatility will reduce.
The increase in the liability-hedging assets is predominantly reflected in the Unit Trusts values above which have increased from 4,166 million at 29 March 2015 to 4,188 million at 27 March 2016.

Retirement benefit plans continued The notional value covered by the interest rate swaps full exposure to the relevant asset class incurred by entering into a derivative contract held in a specific managed portfolio for this purpose at 27 March 2016 is 2.6 billion 29 March 2015 2.5 billion and the notional value covered by the inflation rate swaps at 27 March 2016 is 1.8 billion 29 March 2015 1.8 billion.
The spread of investments continues to balance security and growth in order to pay the RMPP benefits when they become due.
c Movement in RMPP and RMSEPP assets, liabilities and net position Changes in the value of the defined benefit pension liabilities, fair value of the plans assets and the net defined benefit surplus are analysed as follows: Defined benefit Defined benefit Net defined benefit asset liability surplus 5 5 5 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m m m Retirement benefit surplus pre IFRIC 14 adjustment at 30 March 2015 and 31 March 5 2014 6,619 3,833 3,237 1,931 3,382 1,902 Amounts included in the income statement 5, 8 Ongoing UK defined benefit pension plan and administration costs included in people costs 6 6 694 502 700 508 9 Pension interest income cost 240 183 127 108 113 75 Total included in profit before tax 234 177 821 610 587 433 Amounts included in other comprehensive income remeasurement gains losses Actuarial gain loss arising from: 5 Financial assumptions - 102 574 102 574 Experience adjustment - 186 5 186 5 5, 8 Return on plans assets excluding interest income 32 2,103 - 32 2,103 Total remeasurement gains losses of the defined benefit surplus 32 2,103 288 569 320 1,534 Other Employer contributions 488 409 - - 488 409 Employee contributions 48 129 48 129 - Benefits paid 47 33 47 33 - Curtailment costs - 45 31 45 31 Movement in pension-related accruals - 1 1 - 1 1 Total other movements 489 506 45 127 444 379 Retirement benefit surplus pre IFRIC 14 adjustment at 27 March 2016 and 29 March 5 2015 7,374 6,619 3,815 3,237 3,559 3,382 In addition to the above items which affect the net defined benefit surplus, estimated curtailment costs of 36 million 2014-15 10 million have been provided for in Transformation costs in the income statement, along with the associated redundancy costs.
8 Previously an allowance was made for pensions administration costs in the ongoing UK defined benefit pension service costs income statement rate and actual costs incurred offset against the return on plans assets.
These costs are now recognised as pensions administration costs as they are incurred and are included only within ongoing UK defined benefit pension service costs.
Further details of this accounting policy change are provided in Note 1 9 Pension interest income results from applying the plans discount rate at 29 March 2015 to the plans assets at that date.

Property, plant and equipment Below are details of the Groups property, equipment and vehicle assets, which are recorded at their historic cost i. e. what the Group paid for them less accumulated depreciation, reflecting their usage within the business over their useful life from two to 50 years.
No depreciation is provided on land, which represents 198 million 2014-15 202 million of the total cost of properties.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment includes 119 million 2014-15 127 million in respect of assets in the course of construction.
The net book value of the Groups land and buildings includes 431 million 2014-15 413 million in respect of building fit-out.
The 304 million 2014-15 257 million additions do not include any borrowing costs capitalised in relation to specific qualifying assets.
Goodwill This note provides details of the Groups goodwill, most of which relates to the Groups acquisition of its overseas subsidiary, General Logistics Systems GLS.

Goodwill continued The carrying value of goodwill of 206 million 2014-15 182 million at the balance sheet date includes 192 million 2014-15 177 million in relation to the acquisition of the GLS business unit.
In line with the Groups accounting policy see page 142, this goodwill has been reviewed for impairment.
The carrying value of GLS, excluding interest-bearing and tax-related assets and liabilities, is 557 million 2014-15 434 million and the operating profit before transformation costs is 117 million 2014-15 115 million for the year see Note 2.
The carrying value of GLS of 557 million represents a multiple of 4.8 2014-15 3.8 of operating profit before transformation costs.
The net realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review i. e. the fair value less costs of disposal, has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector of 5.6 fair value hierarchy level 2 input.
On this basis, the net realisable value has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value.
The earnings multiples referenced would need to reduce by more than 33 per cent to 3.7 to reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value.
The provisional goodwill of 11 million 2014-15 8 million arising from an aggregation of business acquisitions during the reporting year is not considered material in the context of the Groups total goodwill.
Intangible assets Intangible assets, mainly software, are recorded in much the same way as the Groups physical assets such as property and vehicles, but with shorter useful lives over which they are amortised three to ten years.

Share-based payments This note provides details about the Free Shares awarded to employees, including the associated accounting charge to the Groups income statement under IFRS 2, and the number of Shares held at the end of the reporting year.
Details of shares awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Save As You Earn SAYE scheme are also included.
Employee Free Shares Employee Free Shares are held on behalf of employees in a tax-advantaged Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The shares are held in a Trust administered by Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited Equiniti and may only be distributed to, or for the benefit of, eligible employees.
The Trust is funded by the Company and has been consolidated within these financial statements.
2013 and 2014 SIP 613 shares were awarded in October 2013 to each eligible full-time employee, with a further 116 shares allocated to eligible full-time employees in April 2014.
Part-time eligible employees were allocated a pro-rata number of shares for both allocations.
For both full-time and part-time eligible employees, the award of shares is subject to them remaining employees of Royal Mail Group Limited over the vesting period.
The vesting period for each award is three years from the award date with all allocated shares to be equity-settled.
2015 SIP On 5 October 2015 ordinary shares representing one per cent of the Company were awarded free of charge to eligible full-time employees by HM Government, in addition to a portion of the unallocated shares arising from earlier SIP schemes.
Accordingly, each eligible full-time employee received 103 shares as their 2015 SIP allocation, with part-time eligible employees being allocated a pro-rata number of shares.
All allocated shares will be equity-settled.
On 17 March 2016 HM Government transferred a further one per cent of ordinary shares to Equiniti through a Deed of Gift.
These are to be allocated to eligible employees in due course.
The fair value of the 2015 award of Free Shares is 63 million including 2 million National Insurance which is being charged to the income 1 statement on a straight-line basis, adjusted for good leavers and forfeitures, over the three year period of vesting from the award date.
The fair value of the award was established based on prevailing market prices at the award date and did not incorporate expected dividends.
A charge to the income statement of 158 million including 6 million National Insurance has been made for the year ended 27 March 2016 for all three SIP allocations see Note 5.

Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme On 24 July 2014, a SAYE share option scheme was introduced for eligible employees.
Under the terms of the scheme, the Board permits the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares in the Company to those employees who enter into an HMRC-approved SAYE savings contract.
These contracts are for a term of three years, with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 59 each month.
The options purchased may be exercised during the six month period following the end of the contract, at an exercise price of not less than 80 per cent of the average of the mid-market quotations of an ordinary Share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer date.
A charge to the income statement of 3 million 2014-15 1 million has been made in relation to the SAYE scheme.
The table below shows the movements in share options during the reporting year.
Number of options Balance at the beginning of the reporting year 14,781,540 Options exercised 43,893 Options forfeited 822,607 Balance at the end of the reporting year 13,915,040 For SAYE options exercised during the year by good leavers, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 468 pence.
The weighted average exercise price for each of the above categories of share options is 360 pence.
As a result of the scheme rules in relation to good leavers, 85,860 2014-15 43,850 share options were exercisable at 27 March 2016 at a weighted average exercise price of 360 pence.
The fair values of the options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes share option pricing model.

Assets and liabilities held for sale This note provides details of the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale at the beginning and end of the reporting year.
Assets and liabilities are classified in this way when their carrying value is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
Their value in the balance sheet is the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
At the reporting date of 27 March 2016, only certain surplus property assets are held for sale.
The balance sheet values of the assets and liabilities held for sale during the reporting year are shown below.
The disposal group in this note, as defined in IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, relates to GLS Germanys subsidiary, DPD Systemlogistik GmbH & Co. KG DPD SL.
At 27 March At 29 March 2016 2015 m m Assets of disposal group DPD SL held for sale - 17 Other non-current property assets held for sale 39 15 Total non-current assets held for sale 39 32 Total liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale DPD SL - 10 Disposal group DPD SL discontinued operations The Groups assets and liabilities held for sale reduced by 17 million assets and 10 million liabilities reported at 29 March 2015, as a result of the sale of DPD SL on 31 March 2015.
A further 1 million of assets was subsequently identified and included as part of the sale.
From the previous reporting year ended 29 March 2015 to the date of its sale on 31 March 2015, there were no material revenues, costs or cash flow in respect of DPD SL operations reporting year ended 29 March 2015 96 million revenue, 96 million costs, net nil million cash flow.
A pre-tax profit on disposal of DPD SL of 31 million, including a 2 million loss released from equity in relation to foreign currency exchange translation differences, has been recognised as a specific item in the income statement.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were 2.6 pence per share in the current reporting year 2014-15 nil pence per share reflecting the after tax profit on disposal.
The property used for administrative purposes by DPD SL employees is now surplus to operational requirements and has met the Groups criteria to enable its transfer in the reporting year from property, plant and equipment to non-current assets held for sale on the Group balance sheet.
Property assets held for sale Other non-current assets held for sale of 39 million 2014-15 15 million relate to land and buildings which are being actively marketed with a view to a sale within 12 months, including the property occupied by DPD SL employees as explained above and the former South London Mail Centre site in Nine Elms, Vauxhall.
An assessment of the fair value of these properties was made at the time of their reclassification to held for sale and no adjustment to the carrying amount of these properties was necessary.

The effective interest rate on the bond 2.5 per cent consists of the interest coupon of 2.375 per cent plus the unwinding of the discount and fees on issuing the bond 0.08 per cent.
The bond is designated as a hedge of the net investment in GLS, which has the Euro as its functional currency.
During the year, a loss of 26 million 2014-15 gain of 27 million on the retranslation of this borrowing was transferred to other comprehensive income, which offsets the gains on translation of the net investment in GLS.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current or comparative reporting years.
In March 2016, the Group extended 952 million of the syndicated bank loan facilities for a further year to March 2021 with the remaining 98 million maturing in March 2020.
The syndicated bank loan facility can be cancelled and any loans drawn under the facility can become repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreements.
These events of default include non-payment, insolvency and breach of covenant relating to interest excluding arrangement fees, adjusted net debt and EBITDA.
It is not anticipated that the Group is at risk of breaching any of these obligations.
The covenants require the Group to maintain the leverage ratio of adjusted net debt to EBITDA below 3:1 and EBITDA to interest excluding certain arrangement fees above 3.5:1.
Adjusted net debt consists of net debt plus Letters of Credit contingent liabilities in respect of the UKPIL insurance programme, where the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote and is adjusted for exchange rate movements during the year.
The Groups ratio of EBITDA to interest excluding certain arrangement fees at 27 March 2016 is 63.0:1 at 29 March 2015 40.4:1.
Accordingly, the Group comfortably satisfies the covenants tests within its syndicated bank loan facilities agreement.
The interest rate chargeable on the syndicated bank loan facility would increase if more than one third of the facility was drawn and also if the Group's leverage ratio exceeded 1:1.
Under the loan agreement, the maximum interest rate chargeable would be LIBOR plus 1.45 per cent.
The 500 million bond becomes repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default under the bond agreement.
These events of default include non-payment and insolvency.
The undrawn committed facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date, all expire in more than two years.
There is no security in place under the syndicated bank loan facilities or the bond.

Financial assets and liabilities and risk management Section A provides analysis of the carrying values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities held within the Group.
This includes an analysis of gross contractual cash flows on financial liabilities.
Section B includes details of how the various risks associated with the Groups assets and liabilities are managed, and also the Groups capital management policy.
Section C provides information regarding the various hedging programmes in place to mitigate volatility in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.
If these hedges are in the money, i. e. hedged rates are better than the current market rate, then a derivative asset is recognised, and if they are out of the money a derivative liability is recognised.

Pension plan assets and liabilities are also excluded.
Fair values have been calculated using current market prices bond price, interest rates, forward exchange rates and commodity prices and discounted using appropriate discount rates.
There are no material differences between the fair value transaction price of all financial instruments at initial recognition and the fair value calculated using these valuation techniques.
The fair value of the 500 million bond non-current is 424 million 2014-15 402 million, calculated as the closing market bond price converted to Sterling using the closing spot exchange rate.
The fair value of total Obligations under finance leases is 222 million 2014-15 282 million.
For all other financial instruments fair value is equal to the carrying amount.
The tables below also set out the carrying amount and classification of the Groups financial instruments.

Derivative assets and liabilities are valued at fair value.
Effective changes in the fair value of derivatives which are part of a designated cash flow hedge under IAS 39, are deferred into equity.
All other changes in derivative fair value are taken straight to the income statement.
Derivative assets and liabilities that are not part of an effective hedge designation are classified at fair value through profit and loss.
There are no other financial assets or liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss on initial recognition.
Gross contractual cash flows The tables below set out the gross undiscounted contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities.
For overdrafts, loans and Sterling denominated finance lease contracts, these cash flows represent the undiscounted total amounts payable, including interest.
The cash flows for the 500 million bond and Euro denominated finance leases represent the undiscounted total amounts payable interest and nominal repayment which have been converted to Sterling at 27 March 2016 market forward exchange rates.
For derivatives that are settled gross, these cash flows represent the undiscounted gross payment due and do not reflect the accompanying inflow.
For derivatives that are settled net, these cash flows represent the undiscounted forecast outflow.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities comprise short-term deposits, money market liquidity investments, cash loans including bonds and finance leases.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations and are not disclosed further in this section.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, which create derivative assets and liabilities, principally commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
Their purpose is to manage the commodity, interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and finances.
No speculative trading in financial instruments has been undertaken during the current or comparative reporting years, in line with Group policy.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial assets and liabilities are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, each of which is summarised below.
122 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates arises from the Groups loans, leases and interest-bearing financial assets.
Drawings under the syndicated bank loan facilities are at floating rate.
There were no balances outstanding at 27 March 2016 and at 29 March 2015.
The total interest-bearing financial assets of the Group excluding the non-current investments of 247 million 2014-15 269 million, which consist of the fixed and floating rate cash and cash equivalent investments, plus current financial asset investments, are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with an average maturity of 6 days 2014-15 an average maturity of 31 days.
These shortdated financial instruments are maturity managed to obtain the best value out of the interest yield curve.
The Groups policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate financial instruments, combined with external hedging of interest rate risk, as appropriate, to keep a high percentage of its gross debt fixed.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The tables below set out the carrying amount of the Groups financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.

GLS functional currency is the Euro and most of its revenues and profits are Euro denominated.
There is some exposure to non-Euro currencies, principally in emerging European markets.
These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes managed by the Group Treasury function.
Where possible, exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts.
Hedging will not normally be considered for exposures of less than 1 million and hedging is normally confined to 80 per cent of the forecast exposure, where forecast cash flows are highly probable.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 | 123 Royal Mail plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued Foreign currency translational risk The Groups functional currency is Sterling and GLS functional currency is the Euro.
GLS Euro profits are converted at the average exchange rate for the year, which can result in reported growth or decline that does not relate to underlying performance.
GLS balance sheet is converted at year end exchange rates, and movements related to foreign currency translation are taken to equity.
UKPILs obligation to settle with overseas postal administrations is denominated in Special Drawing Rights SDRs a basket of currencies which comprise US Dollar, Japanese Yen, Sterling and Euro.
Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme, which is subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis.
UKPIL has four active hedge programmes commenced during the current and previous reporting years covering obligations to settle Euro and US Dollar invoices on automation projects.
The 500 million bond issued in July 2014 acts as a hedge of part of the translation exposure created by the net assets of GLS.
The Group entered into 37 million of Euro denominated finance leases during the year 2014-15 nil million which similarly act as a hedge of the net assets of GLS.
The bond and lease payables are revalued at year end exchange rates and the movement taken to equity to offset the movement taken to equity from the revaluation of GLS balance sheet.
The remaining net assets of GLS in excess of the bond and lease payables are not hedged.
The Group uses the translational exposure arising from GLS Euro profits to offset against other transactional exposures.
The net total financial liabilities are held in various different currencies as summarised in the table below.
The majority of the non-Sterling financial assets and liabilities other than the 500 million bond and certain finance leases are held within cash or derivatives.
Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Net total financial assets liabilities at 27 March 2016 13 10 290 29 258 Net total financial liabilities assets at 29 March 2015 34 33 271 22 316 Commodity price risk UKPIL is exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe - which consumes over 130 million litres of fuel per year - and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services.
The Groups fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets.
The strategy uses over-the-counter derivative products in both US Dollar commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rate to manage these exposures.
In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas.
The Groups risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets.
These exposures are managed by locking into fixed price contracts with suppliers and using over-the-counter derivative products.
As the GLS business relies on the use of subcontractors, responsible for purchasing their own fuel, GLS has no direct exposure to diesel costs.
The only other significant commodity exposure within GLS is electricity, which is fragmented across its European bases.
In view of the other highly hedged positions, the Group takes the view that the unhedged exposure arising from the commodities in GLS does not add significant risk to the Group.
Credit risk UKPIL considers that a fair and equitable credit policy is in operation for all its account customers.
The level of credit granted is based on a customers risk profile, assessed by an independent credit referencing agent.
The credit policy is applied rigidly within the regulated products area to ensure that UKPIL is not in breach of compliance legislation.
Assessment of credit for non-regulated products is based on commercial factors, which are commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk.
UKPIL has a dedicated credit management team, which sets and monitors credit limits and takes corrective action as and when appropriate.
The level of bad debt written off in the year for the whole Group is 0.1 per cent 2014-15 0.1 per cent of revenue.
An analysis of aged debt is included within Note 17.
With regard to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash, cash equivalent investments, loans and receivables and certain derivative instruments, the Group invests trades only with high-quality financial institutions.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued Liquidity risk The Groups primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
This is achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows.
Typical short-term investments include money market funds and term deposits with approved counterparties.
Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to ensure continuity of funding.
The unused facilities for the Group of 1,050 million expire in 2020-2021 2014-15 1,050 million expiring in 2020.
Below is a summary of when all the financial assets and liabilities fall due.
The pension escrow investment represents a money market fund investment established to provide security to the Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP, in support of a deficit recovery plan agreed with the Trustee in June 2013.
The next scheduled review point in the agreement is 30 September 2018 and the investment is therefore disclosed as maturing in two to five years.

Capital management The Groups principal objectives are to manage the mix of debt and equity in order to i meet all obligations as they fall due: ii support a progressive dividend policy: and iii reduce the cost of capital of the Group.
The Group aims to do this by: generating sufficient in-year trading cash flows to support the ordinary dividend: maintaining sufficient cash reserves and committed facilities: 2 targeting investment grade standard metrics: managing and maintaining positive adjusted net assets and distributable reserves: and retaining sufficient flexibility to invest in the future of the business.
3 In the reporting year the Group generated 254 million 2014-15 315 million of in-year trading cash flow.
As set out in the viability statement, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due.
At 27 March 2016, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 368 million at 29 March 2015 287 million and undrawn committed loan facilities of 1,050 million maturing on average in five years at 29 March 2015 1,050 million maturing in five years.
At 27 March 2016 the Group met the loan covenants and other obligations for its revolving credit facility and 500 million bond, see Note 20.
4 At 27 March 2016, the Group had net debt of 224 million at 29 March 2015 275 million.
During the year the Group maintained a credit rating of BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors.
The capital managed by the Group, consists of net assets made up of investment, working capital, provisions and net debt, less the pension asset recognised at 27 March 2016 adjusted for any deferred tax liability on the pension asset.
The Groups defined benefit plans are separately managed by RMPP and RMSEPP Trustees and funded from Group contributions see Note 10.
The Groups adjusted capital is shown in the table below.

Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued At 27 March At 29 March 2016 2015 m m Net assets 4,467 3,996 Deduct pension asset 3,430 3,367 Add back deferred tax liability on pension asset 565 667 Adjusted capital 1,602 1,296 The Board has recommended a final dividend of 15.1 pence per share.
Including the interim dividend of 7.0 pence per share, this represents a total dividend of 22.1 pence per share for 2015-16.
This is a five per cent increase on the previous years dividend of 21.0 pence per share and equivalent to 151 million of cash.
As previously stated, given the seasonality of the Groups business, the Board would expect to pay an interim dividend each year equal to approximately one-third of the prior years total dividend and to set the final dividend for each year in light of the full year performance of the Group.
Sensitivity analysis As a result of the mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments and the currency and commodity hedge programmes in place, the Group has no material exposure to profit risk from interest rate risk, exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 2014-15 nil million risk.
The Group has an exposure to the exchange rate risk on translating the GLS net assets into Sterling on consolidation and an offsetting exposure on translating the 500 million bond and Euro denominated finance leases into Sterling at each balance sheet date.
The impact of a five per cent strengthening of Sterling during the reporting year would have been to reduce the Group net assets by 5 million 2014-15 8 million.
C. HEDGING PROGRAMMES The purpose of the Groups hedging programmes is to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, thereby providing certainty for planning.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Accounting rules require the Company to choose whether to designate cash flow hedge programmes or not subject to various tests.
The impact of not designating a cash flow hedge programme is that all gains or losses on the derivatives in the programme have to be taken immediately to the income statement and cannot be deferred into equity.
The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous reporting years.
Hedging activities i The diesel fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases.
ii The jet fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps in US Dollar or Sterling and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from commodity price and US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast jet fuel usage.
iii The air conveyance hedge programme used US Dollar forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from US Dollar Sterling exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases.
The programme finished in April 2015. iv Four capital programmes two of which commenced in 2015-16 use Euro and US Dollar forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from Sterling Euro and Sterling US Dollar exchange rates for contracted capital expenditure on automation projects.
5 v The electricity hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from electricity prices.
vi The gas hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from gas prices.
vii The interest rate hedge programme used interest rate swap contracts to hedge the exposure arising from interest rates on borrowings under the syndicated bank loan facilities.
The hedge programme finished when the interest rate swap contracts were sold, following the repayment on 9 March 2015 of the floating rate term loans.
viii UKPIL trades in SDRs with overseas postal administrations, for delivering UK origin mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK.
The UKPIL overseas postal administrations hedge programme uses US Dollar and Japanese Yen forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the forecast future net purchases of delivery services.
The 2014-15 hedge programme covered the exposure up until the purchases were incurred and recognised on the balance sheet.
No hedge was put in place for 2015-16 due to a reduction in the net imbalance position.
The Group has an undesignated cash flow hedge programme for the exposure of UKPIL to overseas postal administrations liabilities for the year after the purchases have been incurred and recognised on the balance sheet until the time when they are settled.
The derivative balances of these programmes are not material.
5 In addition to this hedge programme, the Group uses fixed price contracts with suppliers to set future prices 128 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued The Group uses the 500 million bond and the Euro denominated finance lease payables as hedges against movements in the Sterling Euro exchange rate and therefore the net investment in GLS.
Foreign currency exchange differences arising from the translation of the net assets of GLS, the 500 million bond and the Euro denominated finance lease payables, at closing Sterling Euro exchange rates, are deferred into equity.
These exchange differences would be released from equity to the income statement as part of the gain or loss if GLS was sold.
During the year foreign currency exchange losses on the bond of 26 million 2014-15 gains of 27 million and foreign exchange losses on the lease payables of 2 million 2014-15 nil million were deferred into equity.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current or prior reporting years.
Commodity price hedging The Groups normal operating activities result in the consumption of fuel both diesel and jet, electricity and gas.
The prices of these commodities can be volatile so the Group enters into price swap contracts to lock future purchases at an agreed volume into a known price.
For diesel fuel and jet fuel, these price swaps are sometimes entered into on the US Dollar price for the commodity based upon available market prices, in which case the Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to lock into a combined Sterling price for the commodity.
For electricity, the Group also uses fixed price contracts with suppliers to set future prices.
The following table shows the commodity, risk and the percentage of the expected consumption hedged or fixed.
The Group hedges the cost of the underlying commodity and any irrecoverable VAT that is incurred on this cost.
The exposures shown in the following table therefore exclude the costs of fuel duty and are based upon the hedges in place, combined with market prices at the balance sheet date for the unhedged amounts.
Fuel duty and the associated VAT adds an additional cost of around 94 million to diesel costs each reporting year.
Total diesel and jet fuel costs for 2016-17 are estimated to be 156 million.

The remaining net exposure is hedged with external forward foreign currency contracts.
For existing currency liabilities, the underlying exposures e. g. the overseas postal administration related liabilities and the derivatives are both revalued to current market prices at the balance sheet date, meaning that no net gains or losses arise in the income statement.
For forecast future currency exposures, the derivatives are revalued at the balance sheet date and effective movements in value are deferred into equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
The following table shows for each hedge programme, the risk and the percentage hedged of the next 12 months exposure: Percentage of next 12 months exposure that has been hedged At 27 March At 29 March Hedge programme Risk 2016 2015 Air conveyance US$ exchange rate movements n a 96% Capital programmes exchange rate movements 100% 100% Overseas postal administrations SDR exchange rate movements 69% 56% The next 12 months exposure is calculated as the combination of the cost of settling liabilities during the next 12 months and the cost of revaluing unsettled liabilities at the end of 12 months.
The Group hedges part of the translational exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries, mainly GLS, by designating the 500 million bond and the Euro denominated lease payables as hedges of the net investment in GLS.

Financial assets and liabilities and risk management continued Derivative values At any point in time, the derivatives in the cash flow hedge programmes are either in the money meaning that hedged rates are better than current market rates, or out of the money which means the hedged rates are worse than current market rates.
The gains in the money and losses out of the money, as at the balance sheet date are deferred into equity where the hedge is effective and an associated financial asset or financial liability is created in the balance sheet.
The financial asset liability is released when the derivative matures.
The amounts deferred into equity relating to the effective portion of the hedges are released when the hedged transaction occurs.
The following tables show the derivative contracts entered into at 27 March 2016 and 29 March 2015 and the associated derivative assets and liabilities.

There are timing differences between the maturity of the derivatives and the maturity of the underlying hedged transaction.
For example, diesel derivatives that hedge the exposure to purchasing fuel in March 2016 mature in April 2016.
At 27 March 2016 therefore, the balance sheet includes the market value of these derivatives but the cumulative gains and losses on these derivatives have been released from the hedging reserve in equity to the income statement to match the exposure to purchasing fuel in March 2016.
There are differences therefore between derivative balances shown above and the balance on the hedging reserve.

Specific items The specific items provisions of 154 million 2014-15 154 million include 78 million 2014-15 81 million for potential industrial diseases claims relating to both current and former employees of the Group.
This liability in respect of former employees arose in 2010 as a result of a Court of Appeal judgement that held the Group liable for diseases claims brought by individuals who were employed in the General Post Office telecommunications division and whose employment ceased prior to October 1981.
Consequently, a provision was first recognised in 2010-11.
The Group has derived its current provision by using estimates and ranges calculated by its actuarial adviser, which are based on current experience of claims, and an assessment of potential future claims, the majority of which are expected to be received over the next 25 to 30 years.
The Group has a rigorous process of ensuring that only valid claims are accepted.
2 million of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2016-17.
The remaining 76 million 2014-15 73 million includes French Competition Authority investigation costs including fine, of which 43 million was utilised in 2016-17 see Note 27 and IT systems costs associated with Post Office Limited POL separation, of which 2 million is expected to be utilised in 2016-17.
A release of the POL separation provision was recognised directly in equity, consistent with the accounting treatment of the provision on its initial recognition in 2012-13 resulting from a transaction with the owner, in their capacity as owner.
A further 29 million is in respect of: German property tax liability of 5 million, expected to be utilised in 2016-17: employers National Insurance associated with the award of Employee Free Shares of 15 million, of which 13 million is expected to be utilised in 2016-17 and 2 million within two to five years: and legacy property costs of 9 million, of which 1 million is expected to be utilised within two to five years and 8 million over a period greater than five years.
Other provisions charged in operating costs Other provisions of 81 million 2014-15 43 million mainly comprise: onerous property lease and decommissioning obligations of 21 million, of which 14 million is expected to be utilised in 2016-17 and 7 million within two to three years: onerous contracts of 20 million, expected to be utilised in 2016-17: and exposures resulting from legal claims incurred in the normal course of business of 38 million, expected to be utilised in 2016-17.
The remaining 2 million is in relation to employers National Insurance associated with the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is expected to be utilised within two to five years.
20 million was reclassified as a provision during the year presented within accruals previously in respect of the estimated exposures for vehicle-related legal claims.
This reclassification was made as a result of increased uncertainty over the timing and amount of future expenditure required in settlement of the legal claims.

This disclosure has been included on the basis that the Group may be subject to a financial penalty, dependent on a future Ofcom decision.
On 28 July 2015, the Group received a Statement of Objections setting out Ofcom's provisional, preliminary findings in relation to its investigation into the terms on which the Group proposed to offer access to letter delivery services, alleging a potential distortion of competition.
The investigation was launched in February 2014 following a complaint brought by TNT Post UK now Whistl about certain proposed changes to Royal Mails Access contracts.
The Group has publically stated that it is considering Ofcoms provisional findings, and that it will robustly defend against Ofcoms allegations.
The Group is not in a position to accurately predict when it will receive Ofcoms final decision nor has it received any detail as yet from Ofcom as to the quantum of any potential penalty which will only be received if Ofcom intends to make an infringement finding.
The Group continues to maintain that it has not infringed competition law and its representations to Ofcom have been on that basis.
