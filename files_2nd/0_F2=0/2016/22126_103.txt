158 Capita plc Strategic report Governance A Acco ccou un nt ts s NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32 Employee benets The Group operates both dened benefit and dened contribution pension schemes.
The pension charge for the dened contribution pension schemes for the year is 88.2m 2015: 85.9m.
In 2016, there was 1 main dened benefit pension scheme where the Group is the sole employing sponsor: The Capita Pension and Life Assurance Scheme Capita scheme.
Grouped together under Other schemes are smaller arrangements: 5 further schemes where the Group is the sole employing sponsor 3 of which are based in Switzerland and 1 is based in Ireland, an allocated section of a Local Government Pension Scheme where the Group is the employing sponsor: a segregated section of a multi-employer scheme in which the Group is a participating employer: 3 segregated sections in industry-wide schemes: and several schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our clients dened benefit pension schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
For the Admitted Body schemes, the Group will only participate in the schemes for a nite period up to the end of the contract with the client.
The Swiss schemes are administered and governed through collective foundations which are separate legal entities.
The UK pension schemes are HMRC registered pension schemes and are subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
Details of the benets provided by the schemes are set out in each schemes documentation.
For those schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme and the allocated section of a Local Government Pension Scheme, responsibility for the governance of the schemes lies with boards which operate under a framework of corporate governance and are responsible for following the relevant statutory regulations.
For the other schemes, responsibility for the governance of the schemes lies with the trustees of the scheme and the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees is governed by regulations.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the trust documentation.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds administered by the trustees of the scheme or on behalf of the Board in the case of the Local Government Pension Schemes to meet long-term pension liabilities to beneciaries.
The trustees or boards as appropriate of the schemes invest the assets in line with their Statement of Investment Principles.
The Statement of Investment Principles has been established after taking into consideration the liabilities of the schemes and the investment risk that the trustees or boards as appropriate are willing to accept.
For those schemes governed by trustees the Group will have been consulted before the Statement of Investment Principles was formally adopted.
For the non-Local Government Pension Schemes the scheme funding regime introduced by the Pensions Act 2004 required trustees to carry out regular funding assessments of the schemes and establish schedules of contributions and recovery plans when there is a shortfall in the schemes.
The recovery plans detail the amount and timing of the contributions required to eliminate the shortfall in the schemes.
Funding assessments are carried out at least every 3 years.
Approximate funding updates are produced at each scheme anniversary, when a full scheme funding assessment is not being undertaken.
At each scheme funding assessment the present value of the contributions detailed in the current recovery plans are compared with any shortfall revealed.
Where the contributions under the current recovery plans are no longer expected by the end of periods specified in the recovery plans to be sufficient to remove the shortfall, new recovery plans will need to be agreed between the trustees and the Group.
Options include increasing contributions due from the Group, extending the recovery periods with additional contributions paid after the expiry of current recovery periods or some combination of the two.
The affordability to the Group of any increase in contributions is a primary consideration in the agreement of any new recovery plan.
Where the contributions are more than sufficient to remove the shortfall by the end of the recovery period, options include reducing contributions due, keeping the recovery period the same, or shortening the recovery period.
The most recent funding assessment of the Capita scheme which was carried out as at 31 March 2014, showed a funding level of 99.8%.
As a result, the Group entered into an agreement to make additional contributions to the Capita scheme over a period of time.
The next scheme funding assessment will be carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2017.
For the other non-local government pension schemes, the latest formal valuations for each scheme were carried out between 31 December 2015 and 31 March 2016.
The valuations for the other schemes are updated by qualied actuaries at each balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at their market valuations at each respective balance sheet date.
The assets and liabilities of the PageOne Communications Pension Scheme which had previously been included in the other schemes were transferred into CP&LAS during 2016.
At a Group level, the disclosures are unaffected by this.
For the local government pension schemes there is a similar funding regime which is set out in the Local Government Pension Scheme Administration Regulations 2008.
For the Admitted Body schemes, the Group will only participate in the schemes for a nite period up to the end of the contracts.
The Group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the respective Scheme Actuary and as detailed in each schemes Schedule of Contributions.
In addition, the Group will be required to pay some or all of any deficit as determined by the respective Scheme Actuary that is remaining at the end of the contract.
In respect of this, the Group is carrying a sufficient level of provision in these financial statements.
The contract with Torfaen County Borough Council had been terminated on 31 August 2012.
During 2016, the Group paid 3.3m in full settlement of its pension liability in relation to this contract.
The Lancashire contract ended on 30 June 2016 and was not renewed.
In due course, the pension fund will confirm the sum payable by the Group in full settlement of its pension liability in relation to this contract.
Prior to 30 June 2016 a group of individuals under this contract were TUPE transferred back to the letting authority and the assets and liabilities which transferred as a result of this are recognised as a settlement together with the assets and liabilities as of 30 June 2016 in respect of this contract.
As at 31 December 2016 the balance sheet includes a provision of 1.75m against this settlement provision.
159 Capita plc Strategic report Governance A Acco ccou un nt ts s NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32 Employee benets continued These dened benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, salary risk, market investment risk and currency risk.
Further to a funding plan agreed with the Capita Schemes Trustees in 2012, the Group established the Capita Scotland Pension Limited Partnership the Partnership with the Capita Scheme.
Under this arrangement, intellectual property rights IPR in specic Group software was transferred to the partnership and the rights to use, develop and exploit this IPR was licensed back to the Group in return for an annual fee.
The Capita Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of 8m for 15 years.
The Groups interest in the Partnership is fully consolidated into these Group financial statements.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements.
Separate accounts for the partnership are not required to be, and have not been, led at Companies House.
Under IAS 19 Revised the interest in the Partnership does not represent a plan asset for Group reporting purposes and therefore the Capita Schemes deficit position presented in these accounts does not reect the Capita Schemes interest in the Partnership.
Accordingly, distributions from the Partnership to the Capita Scheme are reected in these Group accounts as pension contributions to the Capita Scheme on a cash basis as paid.
The Group has considered the impact of IFRIC14 on the various schemes and has concluded that the effect of any such adjustment, as they may arise, is not material and accordingly have not made any adjustments at the balance sheet date.
These amounts do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by the Group.
There are two assets which have been classied as insurance contracts for the purposes of these accounts: A bulk annuity contract entered into by the trustees of CP&LAS late in 2015 in respect of a small number of high individual liability pensioner members.
This contract has been valued as an asset equal to the corresponding liability under the end of year IAS19 assumptions.
The investment of the assets in respect of the Swiss schemes occurs by the collective foundations in the context of reinsurance contracts.

2 Only the discount rate is relevant to the Admitted Body schemes.
Different assumptions apply to non-UK schemes.
3 This does not apply to the Admitted Body schemes or the 3 Swiss schemes.
The assumptions used for the Capita scheme are tailored for each member.
The assumptions adopted make allowance for an increase in the longevity in the future.
The rate for members currently aged 65 is derived from the pensioner membership and the rate for members reaching age 65 in 20 years time is derived from non-pensioner membership.
Sensitivity Analysis Given the nature and number of assumptions, which are not in the control of the Group, there are a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
The table below shows how the value of the dened benefit obligations would increase if the assumptions were changed as shown assuming all other assumptions remain constant : Capita Other scheme schemes Change in assumptions compared with 31 December 2016 actuarial assumptions m m 0.1% decrease in discount rate 30.8 1.5 0.1% change in salary increases 1.2 0.1 0.1% change in ination and related assumption, e. g. salary and pension increases 16.5 1.2 1 year increase in life expectancy 54.7 2.6 The total employer contributions to the dened benefit pension schemes in 2017 are estimated to be 27m in respect of the Capita scheme and 4m in respect of the Other schemes.
