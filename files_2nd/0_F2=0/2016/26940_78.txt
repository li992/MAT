ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 METRO BANK PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29.
Loss per share Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of Metro Bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted loss per share has been calculated based on the same loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of Metro Bank and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue after the effect of adjustment for potential dilutive ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to colleagues.
Potential ordinary shares should only be treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares results in a reduction in earnings per share or an increase in loss per share.
As Metro Bank has a loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of Metro Bank in 2016 and 2015 for these years, the share options would be antidilutive, as they would reduce the loss per share.
Therefore, they are disregarded in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share.
However, the share options could potentially be dilutive in the future.
