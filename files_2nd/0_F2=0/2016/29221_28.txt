132 | Severn Trent Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the group financial statements 13 Taxation continued a Analysis of tax credit charge in the year continued The Finance Act 2015 was enacted in the current year which implemented a reduction in the corporation tax rate from 20% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This resulted in an additional exceptional deferred tax credit of 78.6 million in the income statement and a deferred tax charge of 9.6 million in reserves.
A further reduction to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020 has been announced but not yet substantively enacted.
The estimated impact of this rate change will be a reduction in the deferred tax liability of approximately 37 million.

Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Annual Report and Accounts 2016 | Severn Trent Plc | 133 15 Earnings per share a Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing and discontinued operations attributable to the owners of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2016 2015 m m profit for the period attributable to owners of the company 330.0 119.1 Adjusted for loss profit from discontinued operations see note 38 0.6 3.7 profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to owners of the company 330.6 115.4 Number of shares 2016 2015 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 236.1 238.8 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares share options and LTIPs 1.1 1.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 237.2 239.9 b Underlying earnings per share 2016 2015 pence pence Underlying basic earnings per share 108.7 107.2 Underlying diluted earnings per share 108.2 106.7 Underlying earnings per share gures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, exceptional tax, gains losses on financial instruments, current tax related to gains losses on financial instruments, exceptional items and current tax related to exceptional items.
The directors consider that the adjusted gures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of underlying basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted gures set out above.
Adjustments to earnings The adjustments to earnings that are made in calculating underlying earnings per share are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 330.6 115.4 Adjustments for exceptional items before tax 1.0 18.7 current tax related to exceptional items 0.2 4.7 gains losses on financial instruments 7.7 133.5 current tax related to gains losses on financial instruments 0.2 1.8 deferred tax excluding exceptional charge 13.7 5.1 exceptional tax 78.6 Earnings for the purpose of underlying basic and diluted earnings per share 256.6 256.0 134 | Severn Trent Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the group financial statements 16 Goodwill 2016 2015 m m Cost At 1 April 17.7 42.9 Transferred to assets held for sale see note 38 26.5 Exchange adjustments 0.5 1.3 At 31 March 18.2 17.7 Impairment At 1 April 3.4 28.1 Transferred to assets held for sale see note 38 24.7 At 31 March 3.4 3.4 Net book value At 31 March 14.8 14.3 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identied according to country of operation and business segment.
All of the groups goodwill is in the Business Services segment 2015: Severn Trent Services segment.
A summary of the goodwill allocation by CGU is presented below.
Goodwill in the groups Water Purication business was included in assets held for sale at 31 March 2015, see note 38.
2016 2015 m m Operating Services US 13.0 12.5 Operating Services Italy 1.8 1.8 14.8 14.3 The group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with the policy stated in note 2l.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions underlying these budgets are revenue growth and margin.
Management of each CGU determines assumptions based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash ows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates and is consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Post-tax discount rate Pre-tax discount rate 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 % % % % % % Operating Services US 3.0 3.0 5.6 6.0 6.9 7.6 Operating Services Italy 1.4 1.8 4.9 4.6 6.4 5.5 Specic discount rates for the CGUs are not available and hence a post tax discount rate reecting risks relating to the CGU has been estimated and used to calculate the value in use of the CGU from its post tax cash ow projections.
The equivalent pre-tax discount rate is disclosed above.
Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash ows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
However, in the opinion of the directors, the changes in growth rate or discount rate that would be required to reduce the recoverable amount of the CGUs below their carrying value are not reasonably possible.
Therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented.

The dened benefit pension schemes cover increases in accrued benets arising from ination and future pension increases.
Their assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneciaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualied actuary.
Under the dened benefit pension schemes, members are entitled to retirement benets calculated as a proportion varying between 1 30 and 1 80 for each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of membership, up to 31 March 2015.

Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income since the adoption of IFRS is a net loss of 310.8 million 2015: net loss of 459.1 million.
iv Actuarial risk factors The schemes typically expose the company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, ination risk and longevity risk.
Investment risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on actuarial calculations which make assumptions about the returns expected from the schemes investments.
If the investments underperform these assumptions in the long term then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
Inflation risk The benets payable to members of the schemes are linked to ination measured by RPI.
The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the future level of ination.
If ination is higher than the levels assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
Longevity risk The groups contributions to the schemes are based on assumptions about the life expectancy of scheme members after retirement.
If scheme members live longer than assumed in the actuarial calculations then the group will need to make additional contributions to the schemes in order to fund the payment of accrued benets.
v Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2016 2015 % % Price ination 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 3.6 3.3 Pension increases in payment 3.0 3.0 Pension increases in deferment 3.0 3.0 The assumption for price ination is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term xed rate gilts and on index-linked gilts.
The discount rate is set by reference to AA rated sterling 18 year corporate bonds.
No salary assumption is required because the scheme closed to future accrual on 31 March 2015.
Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Company financial statements Other information Annual Report and Accounts 2016 | Severn Trent Plc | 145 28 Retirement benefit schemes continued a Dened benefit pension schemes continued v Actuarial assumptions continued The mortality assumptions are based on those used in the triennial valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2013.
The mortality assumptions adopted at the year end and the life expectancies at age 65 implied by the assumptions are as follows: 2016 2015 Men Women Men Women SAPS SAPS Mortality table used S1NMA L S1NFA L S1NMA L S1NFA L Mortality table compared with standard table 116% 92% 116% 92% Future improvement per annum 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% Remaining life expectancy for members currently aged 65 years 21.4 24.6 21.4 24.5 Remaining life expectancy at age 65 for members currently aged 45 years 22.8 26.1 22.7 26.1 The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price ination and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 45 million Price ination Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 40 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 65 million In reality, interrelationships exist between the assumptions, particularly between the discount rate and price ination.
The above analysis does not take into account the effect of these interrelationships.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the dened benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the dened benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
vi Effect on future cash ows Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the year is 18 years 2015: 18 years.
The expected cash ows payable from the schemes are presented in the graph below: Expected benefit payments millions 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 10 203040 90 50 60 70 80 100 Year The most recent formal triennial actuarial valuations and funding agreements were carried out as at 31 March 2013 for both schemes.
As a result, deficit reduction contributions of 40 million in 2013 14, 35 million in 2014 15, 15 million in 2015 16 and 12 million p. a. in subsequent years to 2024 25 were agreed.
Further payments of 8 million p. a. through an asset backed funding arrangement will also continue to 31 March 2032.
The next triennial valuation, as at 31 March 2016, is underway.

33 Capital management The groups principal objectives in managing capital are: to access a broad range of sources of finance to obtain both the quantum required and lowest cost compatible with the need for continued availability: to manage exposure to movements in interest rates to provide an appropriate degree of certainty as to its cost of funds: to minimise exposure to counterparty credit risk: to provide the group with an appropriate degree of certainty as to its foreign exchange exposure: to maintain an investment grade credit rating: and to maintain a exible and sustainable balance sheet structure.
The group seeks to achieve a balance of long term funding or commitment of funds across a range of funding sources at the best possible economic cost.
The group monitors future funding requirements and credit market conditions to ensure continued availability of funds.
Whilst the group does not have a specic gearing target and seeks to maintain gearing at a level consistent with its capital management objectives described above, the Board has decided to move towards a net debt RCV gearing ratio of around 62.5% which is in line with Ofwats notional assumption for AMP6.
As part of this move, the group purchased ordinary shares amounting to 110 million, as per the announcement on 13 February 2015.
148 | Severn Trent Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the group financial statements 33 Capital management continued The group has continued to increase exposure to currently low oating interest rates, primarily through the following: In April 2015, drawing down the remaining 330 million of the 530 million, oating rate, facility with the European Investment Bank for a period of nine years.
In March 2015 200 million was drawn for a period of eight years.
Raising 471.4 million of finance through a private placement on the US market, which was drawn down on 3 March 2016.
This debt has maturities of 11, 12 and 15 years.
The proceeds were used in part to repay the remaining 517.4 million of the 700 million xed rate bond on 11 March 2016.
The groups dividend policy is a key tool in achieving its capital management objectives.
This policy is reviewed and updated in line with Severn Trent Waters five year price control cycle and takes into account, inter alia, the planned investment programme, the appropriate gearing level achieving a balance between an efficient cost of capital and retaining an investment grade credit rating and delivering an attractive and sustainable return to shareholders.
The Board has decided to set the 2015 16 dividend at 80.66 pence, a reduction of 5% compared to the total dividend for 2014 15 of 84.90 pence.
Our policy is to grow the dividend annually at no less than RPI until March 2020.

Fixed rate sterling and currency bonds are valued using market prices.
Index-linked bonds are rarely traded and therefore quoted prices are not considered to be a reliable indicator of fair value.
Therefore, these bonds are valued using discounted cash ow models with discount rates derived from observed market prices for a sample of bonds.
Fair values of the other debt instruments are also calculated using discounted cash ow models.
35 Risks arising from financial instruments The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price risk : credit risk: liquidity risk: and ination risk.
The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board has established a Treasury Management Committee to monitor treasury activities and to facilitate timely responses to changes in market conditions when necessary.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The Board defines written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading but may be used to mitigate the groups exposure to financial risk.
The types of derivative instruments held and the related risks are described below.
Interest rate swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in market interest rates.
Further details are set out in sectionsa i and note 36 below.
150 | Severn Trent Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the group financial statements 35 Risks arising from financial instruments continued Cross currency swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate movements on amounts borrowed in foreign currencies.
Further details are set out in section a ii and 36a below.
Energy swaps are held to mitigate the groups exposure to changes in electricity prices.
Further details are provided in note 36b below.
Severn Trent Water, the groups most significant business unit, operates under a regulatory environment where its prices are linked to ination measured by RPI.
In order to mitigate the risks to cash ow and earnings arising from uctuations in RPI, the group holds debt instruments where the principal repayable and interest cost is linked to RPI.
a Market risk The group is exposed to uctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, exchange rates.
The nature of these risks and the steps that the group has taken to manage them are described below.
i Interest rate risk The groups income and its operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to the risk of adverse cash ow impacts from increases in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to the risk of interest costs above the market rate when interest rates decrease.
The groups policy is to maintain 40% to 70% of its interest bearing liabilities in xed rate instruments during AMP6.
In measuring this metric, management makes adjustments to the carrying value of debt to better reect the amount that interest is calculated on.
Details of the adjustments made are set out below: 2016 2015 m m Net debt note 39 4,823.4 4,752.6 Cash and cash equivalents 55.2 176.7 Cross currency swaps included in net debt at fair value 28.1 2.6 Fair value hedge accounting adjustments 15.2 19.1 Exchange on currency debt not hedge accounted 5.9 22.6 Interest bearing financial liabilities 4,885.6 4,930.2 The group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by borrowing at xed or index-linked rates or by using interest rate swaps.
Under these swaps the group receives oating rate interest and pays xed rate interest calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
In practice the swaps are settled by transferring the net amount.
These swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from oating rates to xed rates.
The group has entered into a series of these interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments beyond 2030.
The following tables show analyses of the groups interest bearing financial liabilities by type of interest.
Debt which is hedged by interest rate swaps is included in the category after taking account of the impact of the swap.
Debt raised in foreign currencies has been included at the notional sterling value of the payable leg of the corresponding cross currency swap since this is the amount that is exposed to changes in interest rates.
Valuation adjustments that do not impact the amount on which interest is calculated, such as fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are excluded from this analysis.
The net principal amount of unhedged interest rate and cross currency swaps is shown as an adjustment to oating rate and xed rate debt to demonstrate the impact of the swaps on the amount of liabilities bearing xed interest.

Although the group operates internationally and its net investments in foreign operations are subject to exchange risk, substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, and therefore the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Certain of the groups subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
Exchange risks relating to such operations are not material but are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
These contracts led to a credit of 0.2 million 2015: charge of 0.1 million in the income statement.
In order to meet its objective of accessing a broad range of sources of finance, the group has raised debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
In order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations, cross currency swaps were entered into at the time that the debt was drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR.
Where the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges, hence the swaps have been accounted for as fair value hedges.
The notional value and fair value of these swaps is shown in note 36a.
The group also has a number of xed to oating rate cross currency swaps with a sterling value of 98.3 million 2015: 396.6 million which are not accounted for as fair value hedges.
Economically these swaps act to mitigate the exchange rate risk of debt within the group which is denominated in foreign currency, but they do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a credit of 39.2 million 2015: charge of 75.3 million in the income statement which is partly offset by the exchange loss of 32.6 million 2015: gain of 73.3 million on the underlying debt.
The groups gross and net currency exposures arising from currency borrowings are summarised in the tables below.
These show, in the relevant currency, the amount borrowed and the notional principal of the related swap or forward contract.

It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 21.
Cash deposits and derivative contracts are only placed with high credit quality financial institutions, which have been approved by the Board.
Group Treasury monitors the credit quality of the approved financial institutions and the list of financial institutions that may be used is approved annually by the Board.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the aggregate credit limits of authorised counterparties and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m AAA 5.0 20.0 1.2 1.2 Double A range 100.0 100.0 14.4 22.1 Single A range 615.0 600.0 14.1 128.5 Triple B range 20.0 2.1 740.0 720.0 31.8 151.8 The fair values of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Derivative assets 2016 2015 m m Double A range 11.5 Single A range 33.0 15.5 Triple B range 7.9 40.9 27.0 c Liquidity risk i Committed facilities Prudent liquidity management requires sufficient cash balances to be maintained: adequate committed facilities to be available: and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and exibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and the maturity prole of financial assets and liabilities, and by keeping committed credit lines available.

Its operating profits and cash ows are therefore exposed to changes in RPI.
In order to mitigate and partially offset this risk, Severn Trent Water has raised debt which pays interest at a xed coupon based on a principal amount that is adjusted for the change in RPI during the life of the debt instrument index-linked debt.
The amount of index-linked debt at the balance sheet date is shown in section a i Interest rate risk, and the estimated future cash ows relating to this debt are shown in section c ii Cash ows from non-derivative financial instruments.
Ination rate sensitivity analysis The finance cost of the groups index-linked debt instruments varies with changes in RPI rather than interest rates.
The sensitivity at 31 March of the groups profit and equity to reasonably possible changes in RPI is set out in the following table.
This analysis relates to financial instruments only and excludes any RPI impact on Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulated Capital Value, or accounting for dened benefit pension schemes.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
a Fair value hedges i Cross currency swaps The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate uctuations.
Where the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt, the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m US dollar 27.0 7.3 Euro 11.4 11.4 9.8 8.0 Yen 8.5 23.8 7.9 7.3 19.9 62.2 17.7 22.6 ii Interest rate swaps During the year the group raised 225 million of xed rate debt through its US Private Placement programme.
In line with the strategy to increase the proportion of debt at oating rates this was swapped to oating rate debt via interest rate swaps.
These swaps have been designated as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair value of the debt arising from movements in interest rates.
Since the terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.

Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash ow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
