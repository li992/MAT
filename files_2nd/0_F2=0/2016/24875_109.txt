For consistency, we have re-classified the 2015 comparatives using the same methodology.
Profit taxed at different tax rates relates to profits arising in overseas jurisdictions where the tax rate differs from the UK statutory rate.
Permanent differences relate to items which are non-taxable or no tax relief is ever likely to be due.
The major items are differences in GAAP between IFRS and local territory GAAP, expenses and income disallowed where they are covered by statutory exemptions, foreign exchange differences in some territories and statutory reliefs such as R&D and manufacturing tax credits.
Temporary differences for which no benefit is recognised includes items on which it is not possible to book deferred tax and comprise mainly of the impact of creating utilising unrecognised temporary differences.
The change in provision for uncertain provisions relates to the provisions the Group takes in the event of a revenue authority successfully taking an adverse view of the positions adopted by the Group in 2016 and primarily relates to a transfer pricing adjustment.
Changes in deferred tax arise where a difference arises in the timing of the tax and accounting treatment of items.
Prior year adjustments include differences between the tax liability recorded in the tax returns submitted for previous years and estimated tax provision reported in a prior periods financial statements.
This category also includes adjustments favourable or adverse in respect of uncertain tax positions following agreement of the tax returns with the relevant tax authorities.
