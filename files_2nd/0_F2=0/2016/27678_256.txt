Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 317 1 1 Contingent liabilities In February 2008, the Company issued a guarantee to a third party over Beechwood OMNIA obligations under the reinsurance contracts relating to the offshore investment products sold by a third party.
The maximum payment under this guarantee is $250 million.
This guarantee is accounted for as an insurance contract and payments will only arise should Beechwood OMNIA be unable to meet its obligations under the relevant reinsurance contracts as they fall due.
Beechwood OMNIA was formerly known as Old Mutual Bermuda and currently complies with all capital requirements of the Bermuda Monetary Authority.
The Company routinely monitors and reassesses contingent liabilities arising from matters such as litigation, and warranties and indemnities relating to past acquisitions and disposals.
The adoption of the Groups managed separation strategy on 1 1 March 2016 does not affect the nature of such items, however it is possible that the Company may seek to resolve certain matters as part of the implementation of the Groups managed separation strategy.
