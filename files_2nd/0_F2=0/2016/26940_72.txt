Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.
Where they are short-term in nature or re-price frequently, fair value approximates to carrying value.
Apart from investment securities all other assets and liabilities are deemed to have a fair value hierarchy of level 3.
Level 3 is defined as inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.

Information on how fair values are calculated for the financial assets and liabilities noted above are explained below: a Cash and balances with the Bank of England loans and advances to banks Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Fair values approximate carrying amounts as their balances are generally short-dated.
b Loans and advances to customers Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date, adjusted for future credit losses and prepayments, if considered material.
c Investment securities The fair value of investment securities is based on either observed market prices for those securities that have an active trading market fair value Level 1 assets, or using observable inputs in the case of fair value Level 2 assets.
d Deposits from customers Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Thefair value of a deposit repayable on demand is approximated by its carrying value.
e Deposits from central banks repurchase agreements Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates.
