Accounts NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2016 17 Goodwill continued Goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2016 2015 2016 2015 restated note 40 million million million million Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 77.5 71.9 Process Technologies 309.3 302.4 112.6 112.6 Precious Metal Products 8.2 7.9 Fine Chemicals Macfarlan Smith 117.1 117.1 Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 25.1 22.7 1.7 Other 1.3 1.3 0.6 New Businesses Battery Technologies 21.5 21.3 8.2 8.2 Other 10.0 2.6 0.3 0.3 570.0 547.2 123.4 121.1 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, covering a three year period.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual forward rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable to each CGU.
The key assumptions were: Discount rate Long term growth rate 2016 2015 2016 2015 Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 9.2% 9.7% 3.0% 3.0% Process Technologies 9.3% 10.0% 2.9% 2.9% Fine Chemicals Macfarlan Smith 7.5% 5.6% 3.2% 3.0% Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 9.1% 6.6% 3.2% 3.0% New Businesses Battery Technologies 11.6% 11.0% 5.0% 5.0% For the Battery Technologies CGU the long term growth rate above is used for year eleven onwards.
Over the next decade, management expects the business to grow rapidly as its portfolio of battery materials is developed and so the cash flow projections for years four to ten have been extrapolated using a 15.0% 2015 15.0% growth rate.
All the impairment tests result in headroom of more than 50% over the carrying value of the relevant CGUs net assets and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
