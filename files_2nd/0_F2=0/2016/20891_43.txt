182 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
38B PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE PARENT COMPANY A CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Companys functional currency is the US dollar.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, including amounts due from or to subsidiaries, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are retranslated at year end exchange rates.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the year.
B REVENUE RECOGNITION Dividends proposed by subsidiaries are recognised as income by the Company when they represent a present obligation of the subsidiaries, i. e. in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
C DIVIDENDS PAYABLE Dividends proposed are recognised when they represent a present obligation, i. e. in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
Accordingly, an interim dividend is recognised when paid and a final dividend is recognised when approved by shareholders.
D INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and long-term amounts owed by subsidiaries.
Such investments are valued at cost less any impairment provisions.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount of the investment is the higher of fair value less cost to dispose.
As explained in Note 39D, amounts owed by subsidiaries due in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at year end rates of exchange with any exchange differences taken to the profit and loss account.
E CURRENT ASSET INVESTMENTS AND CASH AT BANK AND IN HAND Current asset investments comprise highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, typically maturing within 12 months.
Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand F BORROWINGS Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
G BORROWINGS PREFERENCE SHARES The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus.
They are accordingly classified as borrowings and translated into US dollars at year-end rates of exchange.
Preference share dividends are included within finance costs.
H EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ORDINARY SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments of the Company comprise its sterlingdenominated issued ordinary share capital and related share premium.
As explained above, the presentational and the functional currency of the Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated into US dollars at historical rates of exchange based on dates of issue.
38C EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE A AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES The average number of employees was 4 2015 5.
B AGGREGATE REMUNERATION The aggregate remuneration of the employees mentioned above was as follows: 2016 2015 $M $M Wages and salaries 0.6 0.6 Social security costs 0.1 0.1 0.7 0.7 The above employee figures exclude Directors who receive Directors fees from Antofagasta plc.

A one-off repayment of capital following the sale of ADASA was made during 2015 and therefore it is still appropriate to consider the rest of the loans as part of the investment in subsidiary.
B TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AMOUNTS OWED BY SUBSIDIARIES DUE AFTER ONE YEAR At 31 December 2015 an amount of $500.0 million was owed to the Company by an indirect subsidiary, pursuant to a 10 year loan agreement.
C TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AMOUNTS OWED BY SUBSIDIARIES DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR At 31 December 2016, amounts owed by subsidiaries due within one year were $50.9 million 2015 $49.8 million.

As explained in Note 23 B, the preference shares are measured in the balance sheet in US dollars at period-end rates of exchange.
The preference shares are non-redeemable and are entitled to a fixed 5% cumulative dividend, payable in equal instalments in June and December of each year.
On a winding-up, the preference shares are entitled to repayment and any arrears of dividend in priority to ordinary shareholders, but are not entitled to participate further in any surplus.
Each preference share carries 100 votes see Note 23A xv at any general meeting.
184 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 39 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES This Annual Report includes a number of alternative performance measures, in addition to IFRS amounts.
These measures are included because they are considered to provide relevant and useful additional information to users of the accounts.
Set out below are definitions of these alternative performance measures, explanations as to why they are considered to be relevant and useful, and reconciliations to the IFRS figures.
A EBTIDA EBITDA refers to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation.
EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposals and impairment charges to operating profit.
This comprises 100% of the EBITDA from the Groups subsidiaries, and the Groups proportional share of the EBITDA of its associates and joint ventures.
EBTIDA is considered to provide a useful and comparable indication of the current operating earnings performance of the business, excluding the impact of the historic cost of property, plant & equipment or the particular financing structure adopted by the business.

CO. UK 185 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 39 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES CONTINUED B CASH COSTS Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operating production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced.
This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as it is a standard industry measure applied by most major copper mining companies which reflects the direct costs involved in producing each lb of copper.
It therefore allows a straightforward comparison of the unit production cost of different mines, and allows an assessment of the position of a mine on the industry cost curve.
It also provides a simple indication of the profitability of a mine when compared against the price of copper per lb.

C ATTRIBUTABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS & LIQUID INVESTMENTS, BORROWINGS AND NET DEBT Attributable cash, cash equivalents & liquid investments, borrowings and net debt reflects the proportion of those balances which are attributable to the equity holders of the Company, after deducting the proportion attributable to the non-controlling interests in the Groups subsidiaries.
This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as the majority of the Groups cash tends to be held at the corporate level and therefore 100% attributable to the equity holders of the Company, whereas the majority of the Groups borrowings tends to be at the level of the individual operations, and hence only a proportion is attributable to the equity holders of the Company.
