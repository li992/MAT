2 O n 20 November 2014 the TAG acquisition was completed.
As a result of this a merger reserve was created of $1.4bn.
The acquisition of TAG was structured by way of a share forshare exchange, this transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of theshares issued.
The Company chose to record its investment in TAG at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable i. e. equal to the difference between the fair value of TAG and the aggregate nominal value oftheshares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealized on the basis it was represented by the investment in TAG, which is not considered to represent qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 10 Guidance on the determination of realized profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of TAG, the Companys investment in TAG was transferred to another Group company in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extentthis loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized.
See note 39 in the Group financial statements.
3 T he merger reserve is an unrealized profit until it can be realized by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
$180.0m of the intercompany loanis expected to be settled in qualifying consideration during the year to 30 April 2017 2015: $130.0m and as such an equivalent proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized and therefore has been transferred to the profit and loss account.

No shares have been bought back under the terms of the above authority.
XIV Return of Value to shareholders In December 2014 we completed a Return of Value to shareholders amounting to 83.9m $131.6m in cash 60 pence per share, equivalent to 94.02 cents per share, by way of a B and C share scheme, which gave shareholders other than certain overseas shareholders a choice between receiving the cash in the form of income or capital.
The Return of Value was accompanied by 0.9285 share consolidation to maintain broad comparability of the share price and return per share of the ordinary shares before and after the creation of the B and C shares.
As part of the corporate entity restructuring resulting from the acquisition we have created a merger reserve of approximately $1.4bn, which is expected to become a distributable reserve in future periods.
This creates flexibility for future Returns of Value once Net Debt toFacility EBITDA is below 2.5 times.
As at December 2014 this was the Groups 4th Return of Value to shareholders and this brings the total amount returned to shareholders since 25 March 2011 through share buy-backs, Returns of Value and ordinary dividends to 554.4m which represents 87.3% of the Market Capitalization at that time.
