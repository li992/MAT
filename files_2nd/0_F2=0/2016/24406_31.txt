The Companys date of transition to FRS 101 is 1 October 2014.
The previous financial statements were prepared in accordance with previously applicable UK accounting standards.
The adoption of FRS 101 has not resulted in any change to the recognition and measurement principles previously adopted and so the disclosure requirements of IFRS 1 are not included and the comparatives have not been restated, other than for certain presentational changes.
The Company has notified its shareholders in writing about, and they do not object to, the use of the disclosure exemptions used by the Company in these financial statements.
The application of FRS 101 has enabled the Company to take advantage of certain disclosure exemptions that would have been required had the Company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in full.
The exemptions that have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements are: A cash flow statement and related notes have not been presented.
Disclosures in respect of new standards and interpretations that have been issued but which are not yet effective have not been provided.
Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries have not been made.
Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: DIsclousres have not been made.
The Company has taken the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
b Investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost less provision for impairment based upon an assessment of the net recoverable amount of each investment.
To the extent that the assessment of recoverable amount improves due to change ineconomic conditions, impairment provisions are reversed.
c Tax Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits or losses at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred atthebalance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
