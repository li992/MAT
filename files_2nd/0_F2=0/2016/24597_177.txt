Other information Reconciliations Loss ratio reconciliation The following tables reconcile the Groups profit before tax to the net underwriting margin used to calculate the combined operating ratio, and its two component measures: expense ratio and loss ratio.
The combined operating ratio is the primary indicator used to measure overall performance of the Underwriting business and shows the amount of each premium spent on either indemnity costs the loss ratio or underwriting operating expenses the expense ratio.
The combined operating ratio is therefore a measure of Underwriting profitability.

Retail operating expenses are those costs incurred by the Retail business in provision of broking services, and therefore do not include acquisition costs incurred in the sale of insurance contracts or claims handling and insurer service costs which are recharged to the Underwriting business.
Retail amortisation and depreciation is the share of the Group charge incurred by the retail business.
