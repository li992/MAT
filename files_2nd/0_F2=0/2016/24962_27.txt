STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION NON-GAAP MEASURES UNAUDITED The Directors believe it is appropriate to include in the Strategic Report and financial statements a number of non-GAAP measures NGMs that are commonly used within the business.
These measures supplement the information provided in the IFRS reported financial statements and accompanying notes, providing additional insight to the users of the Annual Report.
This section provides a definition of the non-GAAP measures, the purpose for which the measure is used, and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the reported IFRS numbers.
The auditors are required under the Companies Act 2006 to consider whether these non-GAAP measures are prepared consistently with the financial statements.
Income Statement Non-GAAP Measures The Directors have applied the provisions of IAS 1 with regards to exceptional items and have chosen to present these, together with amortisation of acquired intangible assets, in a separate column on the face of the income statement.
All profit and loss measures adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangible assets and exceptional items are referred to as underlying.
This is the basis used bythe Directors in assessing performance.
