Higher inflation will lead to increased liabilities which is partially offset by holdings of inflation linked gilts and swaps and the plans provide for caps on the level of inflationary increases.
Interest rate The plan liabilities are determined using discount rates derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities though this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the bonds held by the post employment plans.
Mortality The majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members and their partners so any increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Asset returns Assets held by the pension plans are invested in a diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other assets.
Volatility in asset values will lead to movements in the net asset deficit reported in the consolidated balance sheet for post employment plans which in addition will also impact the post employment expense in the consolidated income statement.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the main post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the charge credit in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

For the UK plans, which represent investment strategies have significant amounts allocated to equities, approximately 66% of total plan liabilities, the discount rate is with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the determined by reference to the yield curves of AA-rated corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows are similar group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Significant amounts are to those of the plans.
A similar process is used to determine the invested in bonds in order to provide a natural hedge against discount rates used for the non-UK plans.
