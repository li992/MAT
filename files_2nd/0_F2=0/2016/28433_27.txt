All-employee share plans It is important that all employees are offered the opportunity to own shares in Prudential, connecting them both to the success of the Company and to the interests of other shareholders.
Executive Directors are invited to participate in these plans on the same basis as other staff in their location.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes UK-based Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved Prudential Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.
From 2014 participants could elect to enter into savings contracts of up to 500 per month for a period of three or five years.
At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares.
If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules.
Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised.
No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Companys ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.
Details of Executive Directors rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the Statement of Directors shareholdings.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 155 Supplementary information Continued Share Incentive Plan SIP UK-based Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP.
From April 2014, all UK-based employees were able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of 150 per month from their gross salary partnership shares through the SIP.
For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential on the open market.
Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan.
If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.
The table below provides information about shares purchased under the SIP together with matching shares awarded on a 1:4 basis and dividend shares.

This is principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include those on the income of consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds that, through adjustments to benefits, are borne by policyholders.
These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of the Company under IAS 12.
Consequently, the profit before all taxes measure is not representative of pre-tax profits attributable to shareholders.
Profit before all taxes is determined after deducting the cost of policyholder benefits and movements in the liability for unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits fund after adjusting for taxes borne by policyholders.

Other significant accounting policies are presented in note E1.
All accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented and normally are not subject to changes unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.
The preparation of these financial statements requires Prudential to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Prudential evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term business provisioning and the fair value of assets.
Below are set out those critical accounting policies the application of which requires the Group to make critical estimates and judgements.
Also set out are further critical accounting policies, and other items which require the application of critical estimates and judgements.

with-profits is a critical accounting policy.
A modified statutory basis of reporting was adopted by the Group on first time adoption of The measurement basis of policyholder IFRS in 2005.
This was set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by liabilities is dependent upon the Association of British Insurers ABI SORP.
An exception was for UK regulated with-profits classification of the contracts under IFRS 4 funds which were measured under FRS 27 as discussed below.
FRS 27 and the ABI SORP were withdrawn in the UK for the accounting periods beginning Impacts 410 billion of liabilities in or after 2015.
As used in these consolidated financial statements, the terms FRS 27 and the ABI SORP refer to the requirements of these pronouncements prior to their withdrawal.
For investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features, IAS 39 is applied and, where the contract includes an investment management element, IAS 18, Revenue, applies.
The policies applied in each business unit are noted below.
Additional details are discussed in note C4.2 Measurement of insurance contract liabilities and investment contracts with discretionary participation features liabilities.
Asia insurance operations The policyholder liabilities for businesses in Asia are generally determined in accordance with methods prescribed by local GAAP adjusted to comply, where necessary, with the modified statutory basis.
Refinements to the local reserving methodology are generally treated as changes in estimates, dependent on their nature.
In some operations, including Taiwan, local GAAP is not an appropriate starting point and US GAAP principles are therefore applied.
While the basis of valuation of liabilities in this business is in accordance with the requirements of the ABI SORP, it may differ from that determined on the modified statutory basis for UK operations with the same features.
US insurance operations The policyholder liabilities for Jacksons conventional protection-type policies are determined under US GAAP principles with locked in assumptions for mortality, interest, policy lapses and expenses along with provisions for adverse deviations.
For other policies, the policyholder liabilities include the policyholder account balance.
For those investment contracts in the US with fixed and guaranteed terms, the Group uses the amortised cost model to measure the liability.
The US has no investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 169 A Background and critical accounting policies Continued A3 Accounting policies continued A3.1 Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements continued Measurement of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of with-profits continued UK insurance operations The UK regulated with-profits funds liabilities are the realistic basis liabilities in accordance with FRS 27.
The realistic basis requires the value of liabilities to be calculated as: A with-profits benefits reserve: plus Future policy-related liabilities: plus The realistic current liabilities of the fund.
The with-profits benefits reserve is primarily based on the retrospective calculation of accumulated asset shares but is adjusted to reflect future policyholder benefits and other outgoings.
Asset shares broadly reflect the policyholders share of the with-profits fund assets attributable to their policies.
The future policy-related liabilities must include a market consistent valuation of costs of guarantees, options and smoothing, less any related charges, and this amount is determined using either a stochastic approach, hedging costs or a series of deterministic projections with attributed probabilities.
The shareholders share of future costs of bonuses is included within the liabilities for unallocated surplus.
Shareholders share of profit is recognised in line with the distribution of bonuses to policyholders.
For the purposes of local regulations, segregated accounts are established for linked business for which policyholder benefits are wholly or partly determined by reference to specific investments or to an investment-related index.
The interest rates used in establishing policyholder benefit provisions for pension annuities in the course of payment are adjusted each year.
Mortality rates used in establishing policyholder benefits are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect actual experience.
Measurement of investment contracts Measured in accordance with IAS 39 to reflect the deposit nature of the arrangement, with without discretionary participation features premiums and claims reflected as deposits and withdrawals and taken directly to the liabilities statement of financial position as movements in the financial liability balance.
Incremental, directly attributable acquisition costs relating to the investment management element of these contracts are capitalised and amortised in line with the related revenue.
If the contracts involve up-front charges, this income is also deferred and amortised through the income statement in line with contractual service provision in accordance with IAS 18.
Investment contracts without fixed and guaranteed terms are designated as fair value through profit or loss because the resulting liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Where the contract includes a surrender option its carrying value is subject to a minimum carrying value equal to its surrender value.
Further investment contracts are measured at amortised cost.

co. uk 05 Financial statements Measurement of policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus of with-profits continued Measurement of unallocated surplus of Represents the excess of assets over policyholder liabilities for the Groups with-profits with-profits funds funds in the UK, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore that have yet to be appropriated between policyholders and shareholders.
The unallocated surplus is recorded wholly as a liability with no allocation to equity.
The annual excess shortfall of income over expenditure of the with-profits funds, after declaration and attribution of the cost of bonuses to policyholders and shareholders, is transferred to from the unallocated surplus each year through a charge credit to the income statement.
The balance retained in the unallocated surplus represents cumulative income arising on the with-profits business that has not been allocated to policyholders or shareholders.
The balance of the unallocated surplus is determined after full provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation on investments.
Liability adequacy test The Group performs adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amounts net of related deferred acquisition costs and, where relevant, present value of acquired in-force business is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement.
The practical application for Jackson is in the context of the deferred acquisition cost asset and the liabilities for Jacksons insurance contracts being determined in accordance with US GAAP.
The liabilities include those in respect of the separate accounts which reflect separate account assets, policyholder account values, and guarantees measured as described in note C4.2.
Under US GAAP, most of Jacksons products are accounted for under Accounting Standard no.
97 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FAS 97 whereby deferred acquisition costs are amortised in line with expected gross profits.
Recoverability of the deferred acquisition costs in the balance sheet is tested against the projected value of future profits using current estimates and therefore no additional liability adequacy test is required by IFRS 4.
The DAC recoverability test is performed in line with US GAAP requirements which in practice is at a grouped level of those contracts managed together.
b Further critical accounting policies Measurement and presentation of derivatives and debt securities of US insurance operations Jackson holds a number of derivative For derivative instruments of Jackson that are entered into to mitigate economic exposures, instruments and debt securities.
The the Group has considered whether it is appropriate to undertake the necessary operational selection of the accounting approach for changes to qualify for hedge accounting so as to achieve matching of value movements in these items significantly affects the hedging instruments and hedged items in the performance statements.
The key factors volatility of IFRS profit before tax.
considered in this assessment were the complexity of asset and liability matching in Jacksons product range and the difficulty and cost of applying the macro hedge provisions 7,616 million of US income statement under IAS 39 which are more suited to banking arrangements to Jacksons derivative investment return arises from such book.
derivatives and debt securities The Group has decided that, except for occasional circumstances, applying hedge accounting using IAS 39 to derivative instruments held by Jackson would not improve the relevance or reliability of the financial statements to such an extent that would justify the difficulty and cost of applying these provisions.
As a result of this decision, the total income statement results are more volatile as the movements in the fair value of Jacksons derivatives are reflected within it.
This volatility is reflected in the level of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, as shown in notes B1.1 and B1.2.
Under IAS 39, unless carried at amortised cost subject to impairment provisions where appropriate under the held-to-maturity category, debt securities are also carried at fair value.
The Group has chosen not to classify any financial assets as held-to-maturity.
Debt securities of Jackson are designated as available-for-sale with value movements, unless impaired, being recorded as movements within other comprehensive income.
Impairments are recorded in the income statement.

and assets classified as loans and receivables at amortised cost, all financial investments Total segmental operating profit is and investment property are designated as assets at fair value through profit or loss.
4,972 million as shown in note B1.2.
Short-term fluctuations in fair value affect the result for the year and the Group provides additional analysis of results before and after the effects of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, together with other items that are of a short-term, volatile or one-off nature.
The effects of short-term fluctuations include asymmetric impacts where the measurement bases of the liabilities and associated derivatives used to manage the Jackson annuity business differ as described in note B1.2.
Short-term fluctuations in investment returns on assets held by with-profits funds in the UK, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, do not affect directly reported shareholder results.
This is because i the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds is accounted for as a liability and ii excess or deficits of income and expenditure of the funds over the required surplus for distribution are transferred to or from unallocated surplus.
c Further critical estimates and judgements Deferred acquisition costs for insurance contracts The Group applies judgement and makes Except for acquisition costs of with-profits contracts of the UK regulated with-profits estimates in assessing whether funds, which are accounted for under FRS 27, costs of acquiring new insurance business adjustments to the carrying value or are accounted for in a way that is consistent with the principles of the ABI SORP with amortisation profile of deferred acquisition deferral and amortisation against margins in future revenues on the related insurance cost assets are necessary.
In general, this deferral is shown by an explicit carrying value in the balance sheet.
However, in some Asia operations the deferral is implicit through the reserving methodology.
The recoverability of the deferred acquisition costs is measured and are deemed impaired if the projected margins are less than the carrying value.
To the extent that the future margins differ from those anticipated, then an adjustment to the carrying value will be necessary.
172 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements Deferred acquisition costs for insurance contracts continued Costs of acquiring new insurance business, principally commissions, marketing and advertising and certain other costs associated with policy insurance and underwriting that are not reimbursed by policy charges, are specifically identified and capitalised as part of deferred acquisition costs.
9,178 billion of deferred acquisition costs as per note C5 b. Asia insurance operations For those territories applying US GAAP to insurance assets and liabilities, as permitted by the ABI SORP, principles similar to those set out in the US insurance operations paragraph below are applied to the deferral and amortisation of acquisition costs.
For other territories in Asia, the general principles of the ABI SORP are applied with, as described above, deferral of acquisition costs being either explicit or implicit through the reserving basis.
US insurance operations The Groups US insurance operations apply FAS ASU 2010-26 on Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts and capitalises only those incremental costs directly relating to successfully acquiring a contract.
For term business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected premiums.
For annuity and interest-sensitive life business, acquisition costs are deferred and amortised in line with expected gross profits on the relevant contracts.
For fixed and fixed index annuity and interest-sensitive life business, the key assumption is the long-term spread between the earned rate on investments and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of Jacksons actual industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual mortality, lapse and expenses experience is performed using internally developed experience studies.
For US variable annuity business, a key assumption is the long-term investment return from the separate accounts, which is determined using a mean reversion methodology.
Under the mean reversion technique applied by Jackson, the projected level of return for each of the next five years is adjusted from period to period so that in combination with the actual rates of return for the preceding three years, including the current period, the assumed long-term annual return gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees is realised on average over the entire eight-year period.
Projected returns after the mean reversion period revert back to the long-term investment return.
For further details, refer to note C7.3 iv.
However, to ensure that the methodology does not over anticipate a reversion to the long-term level of returns following adverse markets, the mean reversion technique has a cap and floor feature whereby the projected returns in each of the next five years can be no more than 15 per cent per annum and no less than 0 per cent per annum both gross of asset management fees and other charges to policyholders, but net of external fund management fees in each year.
Jackson uses shadow accounting to make adjustments to the deferred acquisition costs which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
To the extent that recognition of unrealised gains or losses on available-for-sale securities causes adjustments to the carrying value and amortisation patterns of deferred acquisition costs and deferred income, these adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income to be consistent with the treatment of the gains or losses on the securities.
More precisely, shadow DAC adjustments reflect the change in deferred acquisition costs that would have arisen if the assets held in the statement of financial position had been sold, crystallising unrealised gains or losses, and the proceeds reinvested at the yields currently available in the market.

The majority of the UK shareholder-backed business is individual and group annuity business where the deferral of acquisition costs is negligible.

Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option-adjusted spread models and, if applicable, enterprise valuation and may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments.
Financial investments measured at fair value are classified into a three level hierarchy as described in note C3.1 b.
Determination of impaired value In estimating the present value of future cash flows for determining the impaired value of instruments held at amortised cost, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist, or for conditions that are expected to arise.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted using the financial assets original or variable effective interest rate and exclude credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
In estimating any required impairment for US residential mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities held as available for sale, the expected value of future cash flows is determined using a model, the key assumptions of which include how much of the currently delinquent loans will eventually default and assumed loss severity.

Key assumptions used in the model include assumptions about how much of the currently delinquent loans will eventually default and assumed loss severity.
Assets held at amortised cost Assets held at amortised cost are subject to impairment testing where appropriate under IFRS requirements by comparing estimated future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset.
In estimating future cash flows, the Group looks at the expected cash flows of the assets and applies historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks that has been adjusted for conditions in the historical loss experience which no longer exist, or for conditions that are expected to arise.

Reversal of impairment losses If, in subsequent periods, an impaired debt security held on an available-for-sale basis or an impaired loan or receivable recovers in value in part or in full, and this recovery can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement in part or in full.

The Group monitors a number of internal and external factors, including indications that the financial performance of the arrangement is likely to be worse than originally expected and changes in relevant legislation and regulatory requirements that could impact the Groups ability to continue to sell new business through the bancassurance channel, to assess for indications of impairment.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 175 A Background and critical accounting policies Continued A3 Accounting policies continued A3.2 New accounting pronouncements not yet effective The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been issued but are not yet effective in 2016, including those which have not yet been adopted in the EU.
This is not intended to be a complete list as only those standards, interpretations and amendments that could have an impact upon the Groups financial statements are discussed.
Accounting pronouncements endorsed by the EU but not yet effective IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers This standard effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, provides a single framework to recognise revenue for contacts with different characteristics and overrides the framework provided for such contracts in other standards.
The contracts excluded from the scope of this standard include: Lease contracts within the scope of IAS 17 Leases: Insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts: and Financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
As a result of the scope exclusion above, this standard is of particular relevance only to the revenue recognition of the Groups asset management contracts and the measurement of the Groups investment contracts that do not contain discretionary participating features where the contracts include an investment management element.
The Group does not expect the standard to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments: Classification and measurement In July 2014, the IASB published a complete version of IFRS 9 with the exception of macro hedge accounting.
The standard becomes mandatorily effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted and transitional rules apply.
This standard replaces the existing IAS 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement, and will affect: The classification and the measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
Under IFRS 9, financial assets are classified under one of the following categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and fair value through profit or loss FVTPL based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and or the business model in which they are held.
The existing amortised cost measurement for financial liabilities is largely maintained under IFRS 9 but for financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, changes in fair value due to changes in entitys own credit risk, required by IFRS 13, are to be recognised in other comprehensive income: The calculation of the impairment charge relevant for financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI.
A new impairment model based on an expected credit loss approach replaces the existing IAS 39 incurred loss impairment model: and The hedge accounting requirements which are more closely aligned with the risk management activities of the company.
In September 2016, the IASB published Amendments to IFRS 4, Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to address the temporary consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and the new insurance contracts standard.
The amendments include an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 that is available to companies whose predominant activity is to issue insurance contracts.
Such a deferral will be available until the new Insurance Contracts Standard IFRS 17 comes into effect but it cannot be used after 1 January 2021.
The Group meets the criteria and intends to take advantage of the temporary exemption afforded by the amendments to IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 until IFRS 17 comes into effect, which is expected to be in 2021.
The amendments to IFRS 4 are not yet endorsed by the EU.
However, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG has provided advice to the European Commission recommending endorsement.
The Group will be assessing the impact of this IFRS 9 in conjunction with the requirements of the IASBs proposals for insurance contracts accounting as they are developed to a final standard.
The adoption of the requirements of IFRS 9 may result in reclassification of certain of the Groups financial assets and hence lead to a change in the measurement of these instruments or the performance reporting of value movements.
In addition, for any investments classified as FVOCI, as noted above, the impairment provisioning approach is altered from the current IAS 39 approach.
The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting for most of its derivative programmes but will reconsider its approach in light of new requirements under the standard on adoption.
176 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements Accounting pronouncements not yet endorsed by the EU IFRS 16, Leases In January 2016, the IASB published a new standard, IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied.
The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases.
For lessee accounting, this has the effect of bringing most of the existing operating leases to be accounted for in a similar manner as finance leases under the existing IAS 17, Leases.
Lessor accounting however remains largely unchanged from IAS 17.
This new standard is of particular relevance to the operating leases for major assets where Prudential is a lessee, which relate to leases of properties occupied by the Groups businesses.
Under IFRS 16, these leases will be brought on to the statement of financial position with a right to use asset being established and a corresponding liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The current rental accrual charge in the profit and loss account will be replaced with a depreciation charge for the right to use asset and the interest expense on the lease liability.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of this new standard.
Amendments to IAS 12: Income Taxes In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes clarifying the requirements on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on a debt instrument measured at fair value.
The amendments are effective from 1 January 2017.

The WPSFs profits, apportioned 90 per cent to its policyholders and 10 per cent to shareholders as surplus for distribution, are determined via the annual actuarial valuation.
Application of significant judgement Determining bonuses using the table described in the material features table above requires the PAC board to apply significant judgement in many respects, including in particular the following: Determining what constitutes fair treatment of customers: Smoothing of investment returns: and Determining at what level to set bonuses to ensure that they are competitive.
Keyassumptions The overall rate of return on investments and the expectation of future investment returns are the most important influences in bonus rates, subject to the smoothing described below.
Prudential determines the assumptions to apply in respect of these factors, including the effects of reasonably likely changes in key assumptions, in the context of the overarching discretionary and smoothing framework that applies to its with-profits business.
As such, it is not possible to specifically quantify the effects of each of these assumptions, or of reasonably likely changes in these assumptions.
Prudentials approach, in applying significant judgement and discretion in relation to determining bonus rates, is consistent conceptually with the approach adopted by other firms that manage a with-profits business and is also consistent with the requirements of the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM that are applied in the management of their with-profits funds.
In accordance with industry-wide regulatory requirements, the PAC board has appointed: A Chief Actuary who provides the PAC board with all actuarial advice: A With-Profits Actuary whose specific duty is to advise the PAC board on the reasonableness and proportionality of the manner in which its discretion has been exercised in applying the Principles and Practices of Financial Management and the manner in which any conflicting interests have been addressed: and A With-Profits Committee of independent individuals, which assesses the degree of compliance with the PPFM and the manner in which conflicting rights have been addressed.
 In determining bonus rates for the UK with-profits policies, smoothing is applied to the allocation of the overall earnings of the UK with-profits fund of which the investment return is a significant element.
The degree of smoothing is illustrated numerically by comparing in the following table the relatively smoothed level of policyholder bonuses declared as part of the surplus for distribution, with the more volatile movement in investment return and other items of income and expenditure of the UK component of the PAC with-profits fund for each year presented.

The financial and insurance assets and liabilities on the Groups balance sheet are, to varying degrees, subject to market and insurance risk and other changes of experience assumptions that may have a material effect on IFRS basis profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The market and insurance risks, including how they affect Groups operations and how these are managed are discussed in the Group Chief Risk Officers report.
The most significant items that the IFRS shareholders profit or loss and shareholders equity for the Groups life assurance business is sensitive to are shown in the following tables.
The distinction between direct and indirect exposure is not intended to indicate the relative size of the sensitivity.

The sensitivity analyses provided show the effect on profit or loss and shareholders equity to changes in the relevant risk variables, all of which are reasonably possible at the relevant balance sheet date.
In the equity risk sensitivity analysis shown below, the Group has considered the impact of an instantaneous 20 per cent fall in equity markets.
If equity markets were to fall by more than 20 per cent, the Group believes that this would not be an instantaneous fall, but rather would be expected to occur over a period of time, during which the Group would be able to put mitigating management actions in place.
In addition, the equity risk sensitivity analysis provided assumed that all equity indices fall by the same percentage.
 The Group benefits from significant diversification benefits achieved through the geographical spread of the Groups operations and, within those operations, through a broad mix of product types.
This arises because not all risk scenarios are likely to happen at the same time and across all geographic regions.
Relevant correlation factors include: Correlation across geographic regions: Financial risk factors: and Non-financial risk factors.
Correlation across risk factors: Longevity risk: Expenses: Persistency: and Other risks.
The effect of Group diversification across the Groups life businesses is to significantly reduce the aggregate stand-alone volatility risk to IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The effect is almost wholly explained by the correlations across risk types, in particular mortality and longevity risk.
258 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements   The Asia operations sell with-profits and unit-linked policies, and the investment portfolio of the with-profits funds contains a proportion of equities.
Non-participating business is largely backed by debt securities or deposits.
The Groups exposure to market risk arising from its Asia operations is therefore at modest levels.
This reflects the fact that the Asia operations have a balanced portfolio of with-profits, unit-linked and other types of business.
In Asia, adverse persistency experience can impact the IFRS profitability of certain types of business written in the region.
This risk is managed at a business unit level through regular monitoring of experience and the implementation of management actions as necessary.
These actions could include product enhancements, increased management focus on premium collection, as well as other customer retention efforts.
The potential financial impact of lapses is often mitigated through the specific features of the products, eg surrender charges, or through the availability of premium holiday or partial withdrawal policy features.
In summary, for Asia operations, the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is mainly affected by the impact of market levels on unit-linked persistency, and other insurance risks.
At the total IFRS profit level the Asia result is affected by short-term value movements on the asset portfolio for non-linked shareholder-backed business.
 Interest rate risk Excluding its with-profits and unit-linked businesses, the results of the Asia business are sensitive to the vagaries of routine movements in interest rates.
For the purposes of analysing sensitivity to variations in interest rates, reference has been made to the movements in the 10-year government bond rates of the territories.
At 31 December 2016, 10-year government bond rates vary from territory to territory and range from 1.2 per cent to 8.1 per cent 2015: 1.0 per cent to 8.9 per cent.
For the sensitivity analysis as shown in the table below, the reasonably possible interest rate movement used is 1 per cent for all territories.
The estimated sensitivity to the decrease and increase in interest rates at 31 December 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 2016 m 2015 m Decrease Increase Decrease Increase of1% of1% of1% of1% Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 213 509 185 339 Related deferred tax where applicable 41 62 34 59 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 172 447 151 280 The pre-tax impacts, if they arose, would mostly be recorded within the category short-term fluctuations in investments returns in the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax.
The degree of sensitivity of the results of the non-linked shareholder-backed business of the Asia operations to movements in interest rates depends upon the degree to which the liabilities under the grandfathered IFRS 4 measurement basis reflects market interest rates from period to period.
For example, for those countries, such as those applying US GAAP, the results can be more sensitive as the effect of interest rate movements on the backing investments may not be offset by liability movements.
In addition, the degree of sensitivity of the results shown in the table above is dependent on the interest rate level at that point of time.
The low interest rates in certain countries have had an adverse impact on the degree of sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates.
An additional factor to the direction of the sensitivity of the Asia operations as a whole is movement in the country mix.
Equity price risk The non-linked shareholder-backed business has limited exposure to equity and property investment 31 December 2016: 1,410 million.
Generally changes in equity and property investment values are not directly offset by movements in non-linked policyholder liabilities.
The estimated sensitivity to a 10 per cent and 20 per cent change in equity and property prices for shareholder-backed Asia other business including those held by the Groups joint venture and associate businesses, which would be reflected in the short-term fluctuation component of the Groups segmental analysis of profit before tax, at 31 December 2016 and 2015 would be as follows: 2016 m 2015 m Decrease Decrease of20% of10% of20% of10% Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 386 192 225 112 Related deferred tax where applicable 4 2 21 10 Net effect on profit and shareholders equity 382 190 204 102 A 10 or 20 per cent increase in their value would have an approximately equal and opposite effect on profit and shareholders equity to the sensitivities shown above.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 259 C Balance sheet notes Continued   Insurance risk Many of the territories in Asia are exposed to mortality morbidity risk and provision is made within policyholder liabilities on a prudent regulatory basis to cover the potential exposure.
If these prudent assumptions were strengthened by 5 per cent then it is estimated that post-tax profit and shareholders equity would be decreased by approximately 61 million 2015: 43 million.
Mortality and morbidity have a symmetrical effect on the portfolio and any weakening of these assumptions would have a similar equal and opposite impact.
 Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of the Asia insurance operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
For 2016, the rates for the most significant operations are given in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase strengthening of the pound sterling or decrease weakening of the pound sterling in these rates would have reduced or increased profit before tax attributable to shareholders, profit for the year and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Asia operations respectively as follows: A10%increaseinlocal A10%decreaseinlocal   2016 m 2015 m 2016 m 2015 m Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 97 94 118 115 Profit for the year 77 79 94 97 Shareholders equity, excluding goodwill, attributable to Asia operations 442 367 540 449   At the level of operating profit based on longer-term investment returns, Jacksons results are sensitive to market conditions to the extent of income earned on spread-based products and indirectly in respect of variable annuity asset management fees.
Jacksons main exposures are to market risk through its exposure to interest rate risk and equity risk.
Approximately 91 per cent 2015: 92 per cent of its general account investments support fixed interest rate and fixed index annuities, variable annuity fixed account deposits and guarantees, life business and surplus, and 9 per cent 2015: 8 per cent support institutional businesses.
All of these types of business contain considerable interest rate guarantee features and, consequently, require that the assets that support them are primarily fixed income or fixed maturity.
Jackson is exposed primarily to the following risks: Risks Riskofloss Equity risk Related to the incidence of benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts: and Related to meeting contractual accumulation requirements in fixed index annuity contracts.
Interest rate risk Related to meeting guaranteed rates of accumulation on fixed annuity products following a sharp and sustained fall in interest rates: Related to increases in the present value of projected benefits related to guarantees issued in connection with its variable annuity contracts following a sharp and sustained fall in interest rates in conjunction with a fall in equity markets: Related to the surrender value guarantee features attached to the companys fixed annuity products and to policyholder withdrawals following a sharp and sustained increase in interest rates: and The risk of mismatch between the expected duration of certain annuity liabilities and prepayment risk and extension risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities.
Jacksons derivative programme is used to manage interest rate risk associated with a broad range of products and equity market risk attaching to its equity-based products.
Movements in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads materially affect the carrying value of derivatives that are used to manage the liabilities to policyholders and backing investment assets.
Combined with the use of US GAAP measurement as grandfathered under IFRS 4 for the insurance contracts assets and liabilities which is largely insensitive to current period market movements, the Jackson total profit ie including short-term fluctuations in investment returns is sensitive to market movements.
In addition to these effects, the Jackson shareholders equity is sensitive to the impact of interest rate and credit spread movements on the value of fixed income securities.
Movements in unrealised appreciation on these securities are included as movement in shareholders equity ie outside the income statement.
260 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements Jackson enters into financial derivative transactions, including those noted below to reduce and manage business risks.
These transactions manage the risk of a change in the value, yield, price, cash flows or quantity of, or a degree of exposure with respect to assets, liabilities or future cash flows, which Jackson has acquired or incurred.
Jackson uses free-standing derivative instruments for hedging purposes.
Additionally, certain liabilities, primarily trust instruments supported by funding agreements, fixed index annuities, certain variable annuity features and reinsured Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit variable annuity features contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Jackson does not account for such derivatives as either fair value or cash flow hedges as might be permitted if the specific hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were followed.
Financial derivatives, including derivatives embedded in certain host liabilities that have been separated for accounting and financial reporting purposes are carried at fair value.
The principal types of derivatives used by Jackson and their purpose are as follows: Derivative Purpose Interest rate swaps These generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating payments over the period for which Jackson holds the instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount.
These agreements are used for hedging purposes.
Swaption contracts These contracts provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to require the writer to pay the present value of a long-duration interest rate swap at future exercise dates.
Jackson both purchases and writes swaptions in order to hedge against significant movements in interest rates.
Treasury futures contracts These derivatives are used to hedge Jacksons exposure to movements in interest rates.
Equity index futures contracts These derivatives including various call and put options and interest rate contingent options are and equity index options used to hedge Jacksons obligations associated with its issuance of certain VA guarantees.
Some of these annuities and guarantees contain embedded options that are fair valued for financial reporting purposes.
Cross-currency swaps Cross-currency swaps, which embody spot and forward currency swaps and additionally, in some cases, interest rate swaps and equity index swaps, are entered into for the purpose of hedging Jacksons foreign currency denominated funding agreements supporting trust instrument obligations.
Credit default swaps These swaps represent agreements under which Jackson has purchased default protection on certain underlying corporate bonds held in its portfolio.
These contracts allow Jackson to sell the protected bonds at par value to the counterparty if a default event occurs, in exchange for periodic payments made by Jackson for the life of the agreement.
Jackson does not write default protection using credit derivatives.
The estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to equity and interest rate risks provided below is net of the related changes in amortisation of DAC.
The effect on the related changes in amortisation of DAC provided is based on the current grandfathered US GAAP DAC basis but does not include any effect from an acceleration or deceleration of amortisation of DAC.

Ranges shown based on simple interest.
The upper limits of 5 per cent or 8 per cent simple interest are approximately equal to 4.1 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, on a compound interest basis over a typical 10-year bonus period.
For example 1 10 x 0.05 is similar to 1.04 growing at a compound rate of 4 per cent for a further nine years.
The GMIB reinsurance guarantees are essentially fully reinsured.
262 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements Account balances of contracts with guarantees were invested in variable separate accounts as follows: 2016 m 2015 m Mutual fund type: Equity 73,430 55,488 Bond 15,044 11,535 Balanced 17,441 13,546 Money market 994 832 Total 106,909 81,401 As noted above, Jackson is exposed to equity risk through the options embedded in the fixed index annuity liabilities and guarantees included in certain variable annuity benefits as illustrated above.
This risk is managed using an equity hedging programme to minimise the risk of a significant economic impact as a result of increases or decreases in equity market levels, while taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures in Jacksons operations.
Jackson purchases external futures and options that hedge the risks inherent in these products, while also considering the impact of rising and falling guaranteed benefit fees.
As a result of this hedging programme, if the equity markets were to increase further in the future, the net effect of Jacksons free-standing derivatives would decrease in value.
However, over time, this movement would be broadly offset by increased separate account fees and reserve decreases, net of the related changes to amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
Due to the nature of the free-standing and embedded derivatives, this hedge, while highly effective on an economic basis, may not completely mute in the financial reporting the immediate impact of equity market movements as the free-standing derivatives reset immediately while the hedged liabilities reset more slowly and fees are recognised prospectively.
The opposite impact would be observed if the equity markets were to decrease.
In addition to the exposure explained above, Jackson is also exposed to equity risk from its holding of equity securities, partnerships in investment pools and other financial derivatives.
At 31 December 2016, the estimated sensitivity of Jacksons profit and shareholders equity to immediate increases and decreases in equity markets is shown below.
The sensitivities are shown net of related changes in DAC amortisation.

In addition, the sensitivity movements shown include those relating to the fixed index annuity and the reinsurance of GMIB guarantees.
The above table provides sensitivity movements, at a point in time, while the actual impact on financial results would vary contingent upon the volume of new product sales and lapses, changes to the derivative portfolio, correlation of market returns and various other factors including volatility, interest rates and elapsed time.
The directional movements in the sensitivities reflect the hedging programme in place at 31 December 2016 and 2015. www.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 263 C Balance sheet notes Continued    Except in the circumstances of interest rate scenarios where the guarantee rates included in contract terms are higher than crediting rates that can be supported from assets held to cover liabilities, the accounting measurement of fixed annuity liabilities of Jacksons products is not generally sensitive to interest rate risk.
This position derives from the nature of the products and the US GAAP basis of measurement.
The GMWB features attached to variable annuity business other than for life components are accounted for as embedded derivatives which are fair valued and, therefore, will be sensitive to changes in interest rate.
Debt securities and related derivatives are marked to fair value.

co. uk 05 Financial statements ivOthersensitivities The total profit of Jackson is sensitive to market risk on the assets covering liabilities other than variable annuity business segregated in the separate accounts.
For interest-sensitive business, the key assumption is the expected long-term spread between the earned rate and the rate credited to policyholders, which is based on an annual spread analysis.
In addition, expected gross profits depend on mortality assumptions, assumed unit costs and terminations other than deaths including the related charges, all of which are based on a combination of actual experience of Jackson, industry experience and future expectations.
A detailed analysis of actual experience is measured by internally developed expense, mortality and persistency studies.
Except to the extent of mortality experience, which primarily affects profits through variations in claim payments and GMDB reserves, the profits of Jackson are relatively insensitive to changes in insurance risk.
Jackson is sensitive to lapse risk and other types of policyholder behaviour, such as the take-up of its GMWB product features.
Jacksons persistency assumptions reflect a combination of recent past experience for each relevant line of business and expert judgement, especially where a lack of relevant and credible experience data exists.
In the absence of hedging, equity and interest rate movements can both cause a loss directly and cause an increased future sensitivity to policyholder behaviour.
Jackson has an extensive derivative programme that seeks to manage the exposure to such altered equity markets and interest rates.
For variable annuity business, the key assumption is the expected long-term level of separate account returns, which, for 2016, was 7.4 per cent 2015: 7.4 per cent.
The impact of using this return is reflected in two principal ways, namely: Through the projected expected gross profits that are used to determine the amortisation of deferred acquisition costs.
This is applied through the use of a mean reversion technique which is described in more detail in note A3.1 above: and The required level of provision for claims for guaranteed minimum death, for life withdrawal, and income benefits.
  The IFRS basis results of the UK insurance operations are most sensitive to asset liability matching, mortality and default rate experience and longevity assumptions and the difference between the return on corporate bond and risk-free rate for shareholder-backed annuity business of the PAC non-profit sub-fund.
Further details are described below.
The IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns for UK insurance operations is sensitive to changes in longevity assumptions affecting the carrying value of liabilities to policyholders for UK shareholder-backed annuity business.
At the total IFRS profit level, the result is particularly sensitive to temporary value movements on assets backing the capital of the shareholder-backed annuity business.
With-profitsbusiness With-profits sub-fund business The shareholder results of the UK with-profits business including non-participating annuity business of the with-profits sub-fund are only sensitive to market risk through the indirect effect of investment performance on declared policyholder bonuses.
The investment assets of PAC with-profits funds are subject to market risk.
Changes in their carrying value, net of related changes to asset-share liabilities of with-profits contracts, affect the level of unallocated surplus of the fund.
Therefore, the level of unallocated surplus is particularly sensitive to the level of investment returns on the portion of the assets that represents surplus.
However, as unallocated surplus is accounted for as a liability under IFRS, movements in its value do not affect shareholders profit and equity.
The shareholder results of the UK with-profits fund correspond to the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses declared on the with-profits business, which is currently one-ninth of the cost of bonuses declared.
Investment performance is a key driver of bonuses, and hence the shareholders share of the cost of bonuses.
Due to the smoothed basis of bonus declaration, the sensitivity to investment performance in a single year is low relative to movements in the period to period performance.
However, over multiple periods, it is important as it may affect future expected shareholder transfers.
Altered persistency trends may affect future expected shareholder transfers.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 265 C Balance sheet notes Continued    Profits from shareholder-backed annuity business are most sensitive to: The extent to which the duration of the assets held closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities under the contracts: Actual versus expected default rates on assets held: The difference between long-term rates of return on corporate bonds and risk-free rates: The variance between actual and expected mortality experience: The extent to which changes to the assumed rate of improvements in mortality give rise to changes in the measurement of liabilities: and Changes in renewal expense levels.
In addition, the level of profit is affected by change in the level of reinsurance cover.
A decrease in assumed mortality rates of 1 per cent would decrease pre-tax profit by approximately 67 million 2015: 67 million.
A decrease in credit default assumptions of five basis points would increase pre-tax profit by 200 million 2015: 176 million.
A decrease in renewal expenses excluding asset management expenses of 5 per cent would increase pre-tax profit by 41 million 2015: 35 million.
The effect on profit would be approximately symmetrical for changes in assumptions that are directionally opposite to those explained above.
The net effect on profit after tax and shareholders equity from all the changes in assumptions as described above would be an increase of approximately 144 million 2015: 115 million.
Unit-linked and other business Unit-linked and other business represents a comparatively small proportion of the in-force business of the UK insurance operations.
Due to the matching of policyholder liabilities to attaching asset value movements, the UK unit-linked business is not directly affected by market or credit risk.
The liabilities of the other business are also broadly insensitive to market risk.
Profits from unit-linked and similar contracts primarily arise from the excess of charges to policyholders for management of assets, over expenses incurred.
The former is most sensitive to the net accretion of funds under management as a function of new business and lapse and timing of death.
The accounting impact of the latter is dependent upon the amortisation of acquisition costs in line with the emergence of margins for insurance contracts and amortisation in line with service provision for the investment management component of investment contracts.
By virtue of the design features of most of the contracts which provide low levels of mortality cover, the profits are relatively insensitive to changes in mortality experience.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk and other market risk By virtue of the fund structure, product features and basis of accounting, the policyholder liabilities of the UK insurance operations are, except annuity business, not generally exposed to interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2016, annuity liabilities accounted for 98 per cent 2015: 98 per cent of UK shareholder-backed business liabilities.
For annuity business, liabilities are exposed to interest rate risk.
However, the net exposure is very substantially ameliorated by virtue of the close matching of assets with appropriate duration.
The level of matching from period to period can vary depending on management actions and economic factors so it is possible for a degree of mis-matching profits or losses to arise.
The close matching by the Group of assets of appropriate duration to annuity liabilities is based on maintaining economic and regulatory capital.
The measurement of liabilities under Solvency II reporting requirements and IFRS are not the same with additional assets used for the IFRS annuity liabilities.
As a result, IFRS has a different sensitivity to interest rate and credit risk than under Solvency II.

Excluding any second order effects on the measurement of the liabilities for future cash flows to the policyholder, a fall in their value would have given rise to the following effects on pre-tax profit, profit after tax and shareholders equity.

The market risk sensitivities shown above reflect the impact of temporary market movements, and therefore, the primary effect of such movements would, in the Groups segmental analysis of profits, be included within the short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
 aAssetmanagement i Sensitivities to foreign exchange risk Consistent with the Groups accounting policies, the profits of Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations are translated at average exchange rates and shareholders equity at the closing rate for the reporting period.
The rates for the functional currencies of most significant operations are shown in note A1.
A 10 per cent increase in the relevant exchange rates strengthening of the pound sterling would have reduced reported profit before tax attributable to shareholders and shareholders equity, excluding goodwill attributable to Eastspring Investments and US asset management operations, by 12 million and 47 million respectively 2015: 11 million and 38 million, respectively.
ii Sensitivities to other financial risks for asset management operations The principal sensitivities to other financial risk of asset management operations are credit risk on the bridging loan portfolio of the Prudential Capital operation and the indirect effect of changes to market values of funds under management.
Due to the nature of the asset management operations there is limited direct sensitivity to movements in interest rates.
Total debt securities held at 31 December 2016 by asset management operations were 2,359 million 2015: 2,204 million, the majority of which are held by the Prudential Capital operation.
Debt securities held by Prudential Capital are in general variable rate bonds and so market value is limited in sensitivity to interest rate movements and consequently, any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on profit or shareholders equity.
The Groups asset management operations do not hold significant investments in property or equities.
bOtheroperations The Group holds certain derivatives that are used to manage foreign currency movements and macroeconomic exposures.
The fair value of these derivatives is sensitive to the combined effect of movements in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates.
The possible permutations cover a wide range of scenarios.
For indicative purposes, a reasonably possible range of fair value movements could be plus or minus 150 million.

The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 and 2015 arises in the following parts of the Group: 2016 m 2015 m Asia insurance operations 98 66 US insurance operations 3,861 2,448 UK insurance operations 146 132 Other operations 210 173 Total 4,315 2,819 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable, that is on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
The taxation regimes applicable across the Group often apply separate rules to trading and capital profits and losses.
The distinction between temporary differences that arise from items of either a trading or capital nature may affect the recognition of deferred tax assets.
For the 2016 full year results and financial position at 31 December 2016, the following tax benefits have not been recognised: 2016 2015 Taxbenefit m Losses bn Taxbenefit m Losses bn Capital losses 89 0.4 98 0.5 Trading losses 41 0.2 52 0.3 Of the unrecognised trading losses, losses of 31 million will expire within the next seven years, 1 million will expire within 20 years and the rest have no expiry date.
Under IAS 12, Income Taxes, deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016, and has had the effect of reducing the UK with-profits and shareholder-backed business element of the overall net deferred tax liabilities by 5 million as at 31 December 2016.
The effects of these changes are reflected in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
C8.2Currenttax Of the 440 million 2015: 477 million current tax recoverable, the majority is expected to be recovered in one year or less.
The current tax recoverable includes 112 million in relation to the ongoing litigation relating to the historic tax treatment of dividends received from overseas portfolio investments of life insurance companies.
PAC is the test case for this litigation.
In April 2016, the UK Court of Appeal found in PACs favour on all substantive points in the litigation.
HM Revenue & Customs have been granted permission to appeal the Court of Appeals judgment to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court hearing has not yet been scheduled.
However, it is expected to be at some time in 2018.
The current tax liability increased to 649 million 2015: 325 million due to positive market movements in the UK insurance operations.

co. uk 05 Financial statements  a  The Groups businesses operate a number of pension schemes.
The specific features of these schemes vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which the employees are located, although they are, in general, funded by the Group and based either on a cash balance formula or on years of service and salary earned in the last year or years of employment.
The largest defined benefit scheme is the principal UK scheme, namely the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
PSPS accounts for 82 per cent 2015: 84 per cent of the underlying scheme liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The Group also operates two smaller UK defined benefit schemes in respect of Scottish Amicable SASPS and M&G M&GGPS.
In addition, there are two small defined benefit schemes in Taiwan which have negligible deficits.
Under the IAS 19, Employee Benefits valuation basis, the Group applies the principles of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, whereby a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the Company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed.
Further, the IFRS financial position recorded, reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and any obligation for committed deficit funding where applicable.
The Group asset liability in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: 2016 m 2015 m Other Other PSPS SASPS M&GGPS schemes Total PSPS SASPS M&GGPS schemes Total note i note ii note i note ii Underlying economic surplus deficit 717 237 84 1 563 969 82 75 1 961 Less: unrecognised note i surplus 558 558 800 800 Economic surplus deficit including investment in Prudential insurance policies 159 237 84 1 5 169 82 75 1 161 Attributable to: PAC with-profits fund 111 95 16 118 33 85 Shareholder-backed operations 48 142 84 1 11 51 49 75 1 76 Consolidation adjustment against policyholder liabilities for investment in Prudential insurance note iii policies 134 134 77 77 IAS 19 pension asset liability on the Group statement of note iv financial position 159 237 50 1 129 169 82 2 1 84 Notes i For PSPS, the Group does not have an unconditional right of refund to any surplus of the scheme.
The PSPS pension asset represents the present value of the economic benefit impact of the Company from the difference between future ongoing contributions to the scheme and estimated accrued cost of service.
No deficit or other funding is required for PSPS.
Deficit funding, where applicable, is apportioned in the ratio of 70 30 between the PAC with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations following detailed considerations in 2005 of the sourcing of previous contributions.
Employer contributions for ongoing service of current employees are apportioned in the ratio relevant to current activity.
ii The deficit of SASPS has been allocated 40 per cent to the PAC with-profits fund and 60 per cent to the shareholders fund as at 31 December 2016 and 2015. iii The underlying position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential insurance policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
iv At 31 December 2016, the PSPS pension asset of 159 million 2015: 169 million and the other schemes pension liabilities of 288 million 2015: 85 million are included within Other debtors and Provisions respectively on the consolidated statement of financial position.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 269 C Balance sheet notes Continued  a   Defined benefit pension schemes in the UK are generally required to be subject to full actuarial valuations every three years in order to assess the appropriate level of funding for schemes in relation to their commitments.
These valuations include assessments of the likely rate of return on the assets held within the separate trustee administered funds.
The information on the latest completed actuarial valuation for the UK schemes is shown in the table below: PSPS SASPS M&GGPS Last completed actuarial 5 April 2014 31 March 2014 31 December 2014 valuation date Valuation actuary, all Fellows C G Singer Jonathan Seed Paul Belok of the Institute and Faculty Towers Watson Limited Xafinity Consulting AON Hewitt Limited of Actuaries Funding level at the last 107 per cent 78 per cent 99 per cent valuation Deficit funding arrangement No deficit or other funding Deficit funding of 21 million No deficit funding required from agreed with the Trustees required.

The deficit funding will be 6 million per annum reviewed every three years at excluding expenses subsequent valuations For PSPS, the market value of the scheme assets as at the 5 April 2014 valuation was 6,165 million.

From 2010 onwards, in line with the CMIs 2009 projection model with a long-term rate of 1.75 per cent per annum 1.50 per cent per annum, and minor scheme-specific calibrations.
 Responsibility of making good of any deficit that may arise in the schemes lies with the employers of the schemes, which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Accordingly, the pension schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are interest rate and investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.
270 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements Corporategovernance The Groups UK pension schemes are regulated by The Pension Regulator in accordance with the Pension Act 1995.
Trustees have been appointed for each pension scheme and they have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the scheme is managed in accordance with the Trust Deed & Rules.
All of the three Groups UK defined benefit pension schemes the PSPS, SASPS and M&GGPS are final salary schemes, which are closed to new entrants.
The Trustee of each scheme sets the general investment policy and specifies any restrictions on types of investment and the degrees of divergence permitted from the benchmark, but delegates the responsibility for selection and realisation of specific investments to the Investment Managers.
The Trustee consults the Principal Employer eg The Prudential Assurance Company for PSPS, on the investment principles, but the ultimate responsibility for the investment of the assets of the scheme lies with the Trustee.
The Trustee of each of the schemes manages the investment strategy of the scheme to achieve an acceptable balance between investing in the assets that most closely match the expected benefit payments and assets that are expected to achieve a greater return, in the hope of reducing the contributions required or providing additional benefits to members.
The PSPS scheme has entered into a derivatives-based strategy to match the duration and inflation profile of its liabilities.
This involved a reallocation from other investments to other assets with an interest and inflation swap overlay.
As at 31 December 2016, the nominal value of the interest and inflation-linked swaps amounted to 0.8 billion 2015: 0.7 billion and 5.0 billion 2015: 3.4 billion respectively.
The SASPS and M&GGPS use very limited or no derivatives to manage their risks.
b Assumptions The actuarial assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended 31 December were as follows: 2016 % 2015 % Discount rate 2.6 3.8 Rate of increase in salaries 3.2 3.0 Rate of inflation Retail Prices Index RPI 3.2 3.0 Consumer Prices Index CPI 2.2 2.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment for inflation: PSPS: Guaranteed maximum 5% 2.5 2.5 Guaranteed maximum 2.5% 2.5 2.5 Discretionary 2.5 2.5 Other schemes 3.2 3.0 The discount rate has been determined by reference to an AA corporate bond index, adjusted where applicable, to allow for the difference in duration between the index and the pension liabilities.
The rate of inflation reflects the long-term assumption for the UK RPI or CPI depending on the tranche of the schemes.
The calculations are based on current mortality estimates with an allowance made for future improvements in mortality.
This allowance was updated in 2016 to reflect the CMIs 2014 mortality improvements model, with scheme-specific calibrations.
For immediate annuities in payment, in 2016 and 2015, a long-term mortality improvement rate of 1.75 per cent per annum and 1.25 per cent per annum was applied for males and females, respectively.
c  This section illustrates the financial position of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes on an economic basis and the IAS 19 basis.
The underlying pension position on an economic basis reflects the assets including investments in Prudential policies that are offset against liabilities to policyholders on the Group consolidation and the liabilities of the schemes.
The IAS 19 basis excludes the investments in Prudential policies.
At 31 December 2016, the investments in Prudential insurance policies comprise 134 million 2015: 77 million for the M&GGPS and there were no investments in Prudential insurance policies for PSPS and SASPS 2015: 125 million for PSPS.
In principle, on consolidation, the investments are eliminated against policyholder liabilities of UK insurance operations, so that the formal IAS 19 position for the scheme in isolation excludes these items.
This treatment applies to the M&GGPS investments.
However, in 2015, as a substantial portion of the Companys interest in the underlying surplus of PSPS was not recognised, the adjustment was not necessary for the PSPS investments.

These losses were partially offset by the increase in the return on the scheme assets, which was greater than the amount included in interest income by 1,203 million.
d  The sensitivity information below is based on the core scheme liabilities and assumptions at the balance sheet date.
The sensitivity is calculated based on a change in one assumption with all other assumptions being held constant.
As such, interdependencies between the assumptions are excluded.
The sensitivity of the underlying pension scheme liabilities as shown above does not directly equate to the impact on the profit or loss attributable to shareholders or shareholders equity due to the effect of the application of IFRIC 14 on PSPS and the allocation of a share of the interest in financial position of the PSPS and SASPS to the PAC with-profits fund as described above.

The provisions pertain to property liabilities resulting from the closure of regional sales centres and branches and staff terminations and other transformation costs to enable streamlining of operations.
ii Other provisions comprise staff benefits provisions of 415 million 2015: 384 million that are generally expected to be paid out within the next three years, provisions for onerous contracts of 20 million 2015: 31 million, other provisions of 35 million 2015: 79 million and a provision for review of past annuity sales of 175 million 2015: nil.
Prudential has agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to review annuities sold without advice after 1 July 2008 to its contract-based defined contribution pension customers.
The review will examine whether customers were given sufficient information about their potential eligibility to purchase an enhanced annuity, either from Prudential or another pension provider.
The review is expected to commence in 2017 and last a period of three years.
A provision of 175 million has been established at 31 December 2016 to cover the costs of undertaking the review and any potential redress.
The ultimate amount that will be expended by the Group on the review remains uncertain.
Although the Groups professional indemnity insurance may mitigate the overall financial impact of this review, with potential insurance recoveries of up to 175 million, no such recovery has been factored in the provision, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
C12Capital a Groupobjectives,  i Capitalmeasure The Group manages its Group Solvency II own funds as its measure of capital.
At 31 December 2016, estimated Group Solvency II Own Funds were 24.8 billion.
ii  From 1 January 2016, Solvency II is the Groups consolidated capital regime.
Solvency II is a risk-based solvency framework required under the European Solvency II Directive as implemented by the Prudential Regulatory Authority in the UK.
The Solvency II surplus represents the aggregated capital held by the Group less solvency capital requirements.
iii  The Group solvency capital requirement has been met during 2016.
As well as holding sufficient capital to meet Solvency II requirements at Group level, the Group also closely manages the cash it holds within its central holding companies so that it can: a Maintain flexibility, fund new opportunities and absorb shock events b Fund dividends c Cover central costs and debt payments More details on holding company cash flows and balances are given in the section II a of the additional unaudited financial information.
While the Group at a consolidated level is subject to the Solvency II requirements, at a business unit level capital is defined by local capital regulations and local business needs.
Each of the Groups long-term business operations is capitalised to a sufficiently strong level for its individual circumstances.
276 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements The Group manages its assets, liabilities and capital locally, in accordance with local regulatory requirements and reflecting the different types of liabilities in each business.
As a result of the diversity of products offered by Prudential and the different regulatory regimes under which it operates, the Group employs differing methods of asset liability and capital management, depending on the business concerned.
Stochastic modelling of assets and liabilities is undertaken in the UK, US and Asia to assess the economic capital requirements.
A stochastic approach models the inter-relationship between asset and liability movements, taking into account asset correlation, management actions and policyholder behaviour under a large number of alternative economic scenarios.
In addition, reserve adequacy testing under a range of scenarios and dynamic solvency testing is carried out, including under certain scenarios mandated by the UK, US and Asian regulators.
The sensitivity of liabilities and other components of total capital vary depending upon the type of business concerned and this conditions the approach to asset liability management.
b  The most significant local capital requirements are: i  The estimated capital position for Asia life insurance operations with reconciliation to shareholders equity is shown below: 2016 m 2015 m Group IFRS shareholders equity 4,993 3,956 Adjustments to regulatory basis Unallocated surplus of with-profits funds 2,667 2,553 Deferred acquisition costs, distribution rights and goodwill of non-participating business not recognised for regulatory reporting 1,365 1,301 Other adjustments 1,627 31 Total adjustments 2,929 1,221 Total available capital resources of life assurance businesses on local regulatory bases 7,922 5,177 The capital requirements of material territories are: Hong Kong The capital requirement varies by underlying risk and duration of liabilities, but is generally determined as 4 per cent of mathematical reserves plus 0.3 per cent of the capital at risk.
Mathematical reserves are based on a best estimate basis with prudent margins for adverse deviations, discounted at a valuation interest rate based on a blend between the risk-adjusted portfolio yield and reinvestment rate.
Indonesia Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach.
Insurance companies in Indonesia are expected to maintain the level of net assets above 120 per cent of solvency capital.
Malaysia A risk-based capital framework applies in Malaysia.
The local regulator has set a Supervisory Target Capital Level of 130 per cent below which supervisory actions of increasing intensity will be taken.
Each insurer is also required to set its own Individual Target Capital Level to reflect its own risk profile and this is expected to be higher than the Supervisory Target Capital Level.
Singapore A risk-based capital framework applies in Singapore.
A registered insurer incorporated in Singapore is required at all times to maintain a minimum level of paid-up ordinary share capital and to ensure that its financial resources are not less than the greater of i the total risk requirement arising from the assets and liabilities of the insurer, calculated in accordance with the Singapore Insurance Act: or ii a minimum amount of 5 million Singapore Dollars.
The regulator also has the authority to direct that the insurer satisfy additional capital adequacy requirements in addition to those set forth under the Singapore Insurance Act if it considers such additional requirements appropriate.

Under these requirements life insurance companies report using a formula-based capital standard which includes components calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items and a separate model-based component for market risk associated primarily with variable annuity products.
At 31 December 2016, Jackson had a permitted practice in effect as granted by the local regulator allowing Jackson to carry certain interest rate swaps at book value, as if statutory hedge accounting were in place, instead of at fair value as would have been otherwise required.
Jackson is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its interest rate swap programme pursuant to the Michigan Insurance Code.
The total effect of this permitted practice, net of tax, was to decrease statutory surplus by 334 million at 31 December 2016.
Under the equivalence provisions of Solvency II, Jackson is incorporated into the Groups Solvency II position at a level equal to available capital in excess of 250 per cent of the US local risk-based capital requirement.
iii  From 1 January 2016, UK insurance operations are subject to Solvency II capital requirements on an individual basis.
The UK solvency capital requirement has been met during 2016. iv  Certain asset management subsidiaries of the Group are subject to regulatory requirements.
The movement in the year of the surplus regulatory capital position of those subsidiaries, combined with the movement in the IFRS basis shareholders funds for unregulated asset management operations, is as follows:  2016 m 2015 m Prudential Eastspring M&G US Capital Investments Total Total Regulatory and other surplus Beginning of year 402 182 70 149 803 534 Gains losses during the year 339 8 23 122 446 392 Movement in capital requirement 46 8 54 36 Capital injection 4 Distributions made to the parent company 290 18 45 79 432 262 Exchange and other movements 33 20 20 73 99 End of year 405 205 22 204 836 803 278 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements c  In the UK, the Solvency II regime became effective on 1 January 2016.
PAC is required to meet the Solvency II capital requirements as a company as a whole, ie covering both its ring-fenced with-profits funds and non-profit funds.
Further, the surplus of the with-profits funds is ring-fenced from the shareholder balance sheet with restrictions as to its distribution.
Distributions from the with-profits funds to shareholders continue to reflect the shareholders one-ninth share of the cost of declared policyholders bonuses.
For Jackson, capital retention is maintained at a level consistent with an appropriate rating by Standard & Poors.
Currently, Jackson is rated AA.
Jackson can pay dividends on its capital stock only out of earned surplus unless prior regulatory approval is obtained.
Furthermore, dividends which exceed the greater of statutory net gain from operations less net realised investments losses for the prior year or 10 per cent of Jacksons prior year end statutory surplus, excluding any increase arising from the application of permitted practices, require prior regulatory approval.
For Asia subsidiaries, the amounts retained within the companies are at levels that provide an appropriate level of capital strength in excess of the local regulatory minimum.
For ring-fenced with-profits funds, the excess of assets over liabilities is retained with distribution tied to the shareholders share of bonuses through declaration of actuarially determined surplus.
The businesses in Asia may, in general, remit dividends to the UK, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the local regulatory solvency targets.
Available capital of the non-insurance business units is transferable to the life assurance businesses after taking account of an appropriate level of operating capital, based on local regulatory solvency targets, over and above basis liabilities.

co. uk 05 Financial statements D Other notes  On 10 November 2016, the Group announced that it had reached an agreement to sell 100 per cent of its life insurance subsidiary in Korea, PCA Life Insurance Co. Ltd. PCA Life Korea, to Mirae Asset Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Mirae, for KRW170 billion equivalent to 114 million at 31 December 2016 closing exchange rate.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
The Korea life business has been classified as held for sale in these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.
Consistent with its classification as held for sale, the IFRS carrying value of the Korea life business and its related goodwill has been set to 105 million at 31 December 2016, representing the proceeds, net of 9 million of related expenses.
This has resulted in a charge for Remeasurement of Korea Life business classified as held for sale of 238 million in the income statement.
To facilitate comparisons of businesses retained by the Group, the supplementary analysis of profit shown in note B1.1 shows separately the results of the Korea life business for both 2016 and 2015.
For 2016 the result for the year, including short-term fluctuations in investment returns, together with the adjustment to the carrying value have given rise to an aggregate loss of 227 million 2015: 56 million profit.
This comprises: AER CER 2016 m 2015 m 2015 m Remeasurement of carrying value on classification as held for sale 238 Amounts that would otherwise be classified within: Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns 20 38 42 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns 9 18 20 Loss profit attaching to held for sale Korea life business 227 56 62 Related tax charge 4 14 15 The assets and liabilities of the Korea life business classified as held for sale on the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016 are as follows: 2016 m Assets 1 Investments including cash and cash equivalents 3,722 2 Other assets including goodwill 379 4,101 2 Adjustment for remeasurement of the carrying value of the business to fair value less costs to sell 238 Assets held for sale 3,863 Liabilities 3 Policyholder liabilities 3,325 Other liabilities 433 Liabilities held for sale 3,758 Net assets 105 1 The investments of the Korea life business comprise primarily Equity securities and portfolio holdings in unit trusts 2,527 million as at 31 December 2016.

co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 281 D Other notes Continued   In addition to the matters set out in note C11 in relation to the Financial Conduct Authority review of past annuity sales, the Group is involved in various litigation and regulatory issues.
These may from time to time include class actions involving Jackson.
While the outcome of such litigation and regulatory issues cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 Jackson had previously received regulatory enquiries on an industry-wide matter regarding claims settlement practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws.
During 2015, Jackson reached agreements to settle issues related to these enquiries.
At 31 December 2016, Jackson has accrued 13 million 2015: 16 million to cover any such liability.
Guarantees Guarantee funds in both the UK and the US provide for payments to be made to policyholders on behalf of insolvent life insurance companies and are financed by payments assessed on solvent insurance companies based on location, volume and types of business.
The estimated reserve for future guarantee fund assessments is not significant.
The directors believe that the reserve is adequate for all anticipated payments for known insolvencies.
The Group has provided other guarantees and commitments to third-parties entered into in the normal course of business but the Company does not consider that the amounts involved are significant.
 PAC is liable to meet its obligations to with-profits policyholders even if the assets of the with-profits sub-funds are insufficient to do so.
The assets, represented by the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, in excess of amounts expected to be paid for future terminal bonuses and related shareholder transfers the excess assets in the with-profits sub-funds could be materially depleted over time by, for example, a significant or sustained equity market downturn, costs of significant fundamental strategic change or a material increase in the pension mis-selling provision.
In the unlikely circumstance that the depletion of the excess assets within the long-term fund was such that the Groups ability to satisfy policyholders reasonable expectations was adversely affected, it might become necessary to restrict the annual distribution to shareholders or to contribute shareholders funds to the with-profits sub-funds to provide financial support.
Matters relating to with-profits sub-funds: Pension mis-selling review The UK insurance regulator required all UK life insurance companies to review sales of personal pensions policies for potential mis-selling.
Offers to all cases were made by 30 June 2002.
Costs arising from this review are met by the excess assets of the PAC with-profits sub-fund and hence have not been charged to the asset shares used in the determination of policyholder bonus rates.
Prudential has given an assurance that these deductions from excess assets will not impact its bonus or investment policy for policies within the with-profits sub-funds that were in force at 31 December 2003.
This assurance does not apply to new business since 1 January 2004.
In the unlikely event that such deductions would affect the bonus or investment policy for the relevant policies, Prudential has stated it would make available support to the sub-fund from shareholder resources for as long as the situation continued, so as to ensure that policyholders were not disadvantaged.
Scottish Amicable Insurance sub-fund Policies within this sub-fund a with-profits sub-fund closed to new business contain minimum levels of guaranteed benefit to policyholders.
Should the assets of the sub-fund be inadequate to meet the guaranteed benefit obligations of the policyholders of SAIF, the PAC with-profits sub-fund would be liable to cover any such deficiency in the first instance.
In addition, certain pensions products within this sub-fund have guaranteed annuity rates at retirement, for which a provision of 571 million was held within the sub-fund 2015: 412 million.
Guaranteed annuities A provision for guaranteed annuity products of 62 million was held 2015: 47 million in the PAC withprofits sub-fund.
 Prudential and PAC have put in place intra-group arrangements to formalise circumstances in which capital support would be made available by Prudential.
While Prudential considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to PAC and its policyholders.

co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 283 D Other notes Continued ,  a  Certain Group subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to the parent company.
Under UK company law, UK companies can only declare dividends if they have sufficient distributable reserves.
Further, UK insurance companies are required to maintain solvency margins in accordance with the rules of the Prudential Regulation Authority.
The Group UK asset management company, M&G Investment Management Ltd is also required to maintain capital in accordance with regulatory requirements before making any distribution to the parent company.
Jackson is subject to state laws that limit the dividends payable to its parent company based on statutory capital and surplus and prior year earnings.
Dividends in excess of these limitations require prior regulatory approval.
The Groups subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in Asia may remit dividends to the Group, in general, provided the statutory insurance fund meets the capital adequacy standard required under local statutory regulations and has sufficient distributable reserves.
For further details on local capital regulations in Asia please refer to note C12 b. b  Joint ventures represent arrangements where the controlling parties through contractual or other agreement have the rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
The Group has shareholder-backed joint venture insurance and asset management businesses in China with CITIC Group, and until September 2016 in India with ICICI Bank see below.
In addition, there is an asset management joint venture in Hong Kong with Bank of China International Holdings Limited BOCI and Takaful general and life insurance joint venture in Malaysia.
The Group has various joint ventures relating to property investments held by the PAC with-profits fund.
The results of these joint ventures are reflected in the movement in the unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profits funds and therefore do not affect shareholders results.
For the Groups joint ventures that are accounted for by using the equity method, the net of tax results of these operations are included in the Groups profit before tax.
The investments in these joint ventures have the same accounting year end as the Group.
The Groups associates, which are also accounted for under the equity method, include PPM South Africa and from September 2016 the Indian insurance entity, see below.
In addition, the Group has investments in Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs, unit trusts, funds holding collateralised debt obligations, property unit trusts and venture capital investments of the PAC with-profits funds where the Group has significant influence.
As allowed under IAS 28, these investments are accounted for on a fair value through profit or loss basis.
The aggregate fair value of associates accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, where there are published price quotations, is approximately 3.5 billion at 31 December 2016 2015: 1.4 billion.
During the period, following its listing and consequent amendments to the shareholder agreement, the Group ceased to exercise joint control over the insurance business in India, therefore the investment has been re-classified as an associate, and continues to be accounted for using the equity method.
The Groups share of the profits including short-term fluctuations in investment returns, net of related tax, and carrying amount of interest in joint ventures and associates, which are equity accounted as shown in the consolidated income statement comprises the following:  2016 m 2015 m Shareholder-backed business 161 185 PAC with-profits fund prior to offsetting effect in movement in unallocated surplus 21 53 Total 182 238 Insuranceoperations Assetmanagement Unallocated toasegment Prudential Eastspring Total central Group Asia US UK M&G Capital US Investments segment operations total 2016 Share of profits from joint ventures and associates, net of related tax 94 21 13 54 182 182 2015 Share of profits from joint ventures and associates, net of related tax 130 53 14 41 238 238 There is no other comprehensive income in the joint ventures and associates.

co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 301 E Further accounting policies  In addition to the critical accounting policies presented in note A3.1, the following detailed accounting policies are adopted by the Group to prepare the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented and normally are not subject to change unless new accounting standards, interpretations or amendments are introduced by the IASB.
a Basisofconsolidation The Group consolidates those investees it is deemed to control.
The Group has control over an investee if all three of the following are met: 1 it has power over an investee: 2 it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 it has ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.
i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those investees that the Group controls.
The majority of the Groups subsidiaries are corporate entities, but the Groups insurance operations also invest in a number of limited partnerships.
The Group performs a re-assessment of consolidation whenever there is a change in the substance of the relationship between the Group and an investee.
Where the Group is deemed to control an entity it is treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities are consolidated.
Where the Group holds a minority share in an entity, with no control over the entity, the investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Entities consolidated by the Group include Qualifying Partnerships as defined under the UK Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 the Partnerships Act.
Some of these limited partnerships have taken advantage of the exemption under regulation 7 of the Partnerships Act from the financial statements requirements.
This is under regulations 4 to 6, on the basis that these limited partnerships are dealt with on a consolidated basis in these financial statements.
ii  Joint ventures are joint arrangements arising from a contractual agreement whereby the Group and other investors have joint control of the net assets of the arrangement.
In a number of these arrangements, the Groups share of the underlying net assets may be less than 50 per cent but the terms of the relevant agreement make it clear that control is jointly exercised between the Group and the third party.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but it does not control.
Generally it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it holds between 20 per cent and 50 per cent voting rights of the entity.
With the exception of those referred to below, the Group accounts for its investments in joint ventures and associates by using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of profit or loss of its joint ventures and associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The equity method of accounting does not apply to investments in associates and joint ventures held by the Groups insurance or investment funds.
This includes venture capital business, mutual funds and unit trusts and which, as allowed by IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
iii Structuredentities Structured entities are those that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.
Voting rights relate to administrative tasks.
Relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group invests in structured entities such as: Open-Ended Investment Companies OEICs : Unit Trusts UTs : Limited partnerships: Variable interest entities: Investment vehicles within separate accounts offered through variable annuities: Collateralised debt obligations: Mortgage-backed securities: and Similar asset-backed securities.
Open-ended investment companies and unit trusts The Group invests in OEICs and UTs, which invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties.
The Groups percentage ownership in these entities can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the Group and other investors in them.
Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Groups ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50 per cent, the Group is judged to have control over the entity.
Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Groups ownership holding in the entity is between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, the facts and circumstances of the Groups involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity.
Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Groups ownership holding in the entity is less than 20 per cent, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity.
Where the entity is managed by an asset manager outside the Group, an assessment is made of whether the Group has existing rights that gives it the ability to direct the current activities of the entity and therefore control the entity.
In assessing the Groups ability to direct an entity, the Group considers its ability relative to other investors.
The Group has a limited number of OEICs and UTs where it considers it has such ability.
302 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements Where the Group is deemed to control these entities, they are treated as a subsidiary and are consolidated, with the interests of investors other than the Group being classified as liabilities, and appear as net asset value attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
Where the Group does not control these entities as it is deemed to be acting as an agent and they do not meet the definition of associates, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Where the Groups asset manager sets up OEICs and UTs as part of asset management operations, the Groups interest is limited to the administration fees charged to manage the assets of such entities.
With no participation in these entities, the Group does not retain risks associated with OEICs and UTs.
For these open-ended investment companies and unit trusts, the Group is not deemed to control the entities but to be acting as an agent.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in investment vehicles commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks of these investment vehicles.
Jacksons separate account assets These are investment vehicles that invest contract holders premiums in equity, fixed income, bonds and money market mutual funds.
The contract holder retains the underlying returns and the ownership risks related to the underlying investments.
The shareholders economic interest in separate accounts is limited to the administrative fees charged.
The separate accounts are set up as separate regulated entities governed by a Board of Governors or trustees for which the majority of the members are independent of Jackson or any affiliated entity.
The independent members are responsible for any decision making that impacts contract holders interest and govern the operational activities of the entities advisers, including asset managers.
Accordingly, the Group does not control these vehicles.
These investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Limited partnerships The Groups insurance operations invest in a number of limited partnerships, either directly or through unit trusts, through a mix of capital and loans.
These limited partnerships are managed by general partners, in which the Group holds equity.
Such interest in general partners and limited partnerships provide the Group with voting and similar rights to participate in the governance framework of the relevant activities in which limited partnerships are engaged in.
Accounting for the limited partnerships as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on the terms of each partnership agreement and the shareholdings in the general partners.
Other structured entities The Group holds investments in mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar asset-backed securities that are actively traded in a liquid market.
The Group is not the sponsor of the vehicles in which it holds investments and has no administrative rights over the vehicles activities.
The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks commensurate to its holding and its exposure to the investments.
Accordingly the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of such vehicles and all are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The table below provides aggregate carrying amounts of the investments in unconsolidated structured entities reported in the Groups statement of financial position: 2016 m 2015 m Separate Other Separate Other account structured account structured OEICs UTs assets entities OEICs UTs assets entities Statement of financial position line items Equity securities and portfolio holdings in unit trusts 16,489 120,411 12,945 91,022 Debt securities 12,220 11,735 Total 16,489 120,411 12,220 12,945 91,022 11,735 The Group generates returns and retains the ownership risks in these investments commensurate to its participation and does not have any further exposure to the residual risks or losses of the investments or the vehicles in which it holds investments.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group does not have an agreement, contractual or otherwise, or intention to provide financial support to structured entities that could expose the Group to a loss.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 303 E Further accounting policies Continued  b Reinsurance The measurement of reinsurance assets is consistent with the measurement of the underlying direct insurance contracts.
The treatment of any gains or losses arising on the purchase of reinsurance contracts is dependent on the underlying accounting basis of the entity concerned.
c Earnedpremiums,  Premiums for conventional with-profits policies and other protection type insurance policies are recognised as revenue when due.
Premiums and annuity considerations for linked policies, unitised with-profits and other investment type policies are recognised as revenue when received or, in the case of unitised or unit-linked policies, when units are issued.
These amounts exclude premium taxes and similar duties where Prudential collects and settles taxes borne by the customer.
Policy fees charged on linked and unitised with-profits policies for mortality, asset management and policy administration are recognised as revenue when related services are provided.
Claims paid include maturities, annuities, surrenders and deaths.
Maturity claims are recorded as charges on the policy maturity date.
Annuity claims are recorded when each annuity instalment becomes due for payment.
Surrenders are charged to the income statement when paid and death claims are recorded when notified.
d Investmentreturn Investment return included in the income statement principally comprises interest income, dividends, investment appreciation depreciation realised and unrealised gains and losses on investments designated as fair value through profit or loss, and realised gains and losses including impairment losses on items held at amortised cost and Jacksons debt securities designated as available-for-sale.
Movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation of Jacksons debt securities designated as available-for-sale are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on investments.
Dividends on equity securities are recognised on the ex-dividend date and rental income is recognised on an accrual basis.
e  i  The Group holds financial investments in accordance with IAS 39, whereby subject to specific criteria, financial instruments are required to be accounted for under one of the following categories: Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss this comprises assets and liabilities designated by management as fair value through profit or loss on inception and derivatives that are held for trading.
These investments are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment return in the income statement: Financial investments on an available-for-sale basis this comprises assets that are designated by management as available-for-sale and or do not fall into any of the other categories.
These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs.
Available-for-sale assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
Interest income is recognised on an effective interest basis in the income statement.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Except for foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities, which are included in the income statement, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Upon disposal or impairment, accumulated unrealised gains and losses are transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement as realised gains or losses: and Loans and receivables except for those designated as at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale, these instruments comprise non-quoted investments that have fixed or determinable payments.
These instruments include loans collateralised by mortgages, deposits, loans to policyholders and other unsecured loans and receivables.
These investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Subsequently, these instruments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group uses the trade date method to account for regular purchases and sales of financial assets.
Where assets and liabilities have been valued at fair value or measured on a different basis but fair value is disclosed, the Group has followed the principles under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
304 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements ii  Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce or manage investment, interest rate and currency exposures, to facilitate efficient portfolio management and for investment purposes.
The Group may designate certain derivatives as hedges.
For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of any change in fair value of derivatives or other financial instruments designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in the income statement.
The Group does not regularly seek to apply fair value or cash flow hedging treatment under IAS 39.
The Group has no fair value and cash flows hedges under IAS 39 at 31 December 2016 and 2015.
All derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are carried at fair value, with movements in fair value being recorded in the income statement.
The primary areas of the Groups continuing operations where derivative instruments are held are the UK with-profits funds and annuity business, and Jackson.
For UK with-profits funds the derivative programme is used for the purposes of efficient portfolio management or reduction in investment risk.
For shareholder-backed UK annuity business the derivatives are held to contribute to the matching as far as practical, of asset returns and duration with those of liabilities to policyholders.
The carrying value of these liabilities is sensitive to the return on the matching financial assets including derivatives held.
For Jackson, an extensive derivative programme is maintained.
Value movements on the derivatives held can be very significant in their effect on shareholder results.
Further details on this aspect of the Groups financial reporting are described in note B1.2.
iii Embeddedderivatives Embedded derivatives are present in host contracts issued by various Group companies, in particular Jackson.
They are embedded within other non-derivative host financial instruments and insurance contracts to create hybrid instruments.
Embedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are accounted for under IFRS 4.
Where economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host instrument, and where the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and carried at fair value as a derivative in accordance with IAS 39.
For Jacksons not for life Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit and Fixed Index Annuity reserves the determination of fair value requires assumptions regarding future mix of Separate Account assets, equity volatility levels, and policyholder behaviour.
In addition, the Group applies the option under IFRS 4 to not separate and fair value surrender options embedded in host contracts and with-profits investment contracts whose strike price is either a fixed amount or a fixed amount plus interest.
Further details on the valuation basis for embedded derivatives attaching to Jacksons life assurance contracts are provided in note C4.2.
iv  The Group is party to various securities lending agreements including repurchase agreements under which securities are loaned to third parties on a short-term basis.
The loaned securities are not derecognised: rather, they continue to be recognised within the appropriate investment classification.
The Groups policy is that collateral in excess of 100 per cent of the fair value of securities loaned is required from all securities borrowers and typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities or letters of credit.
In cases where the Group takes possession of the collateral under its securities lending programme, the collateral, and corresponding obligation to return such collateral, are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group is also party to various reverse repurchase agreements under which securities are purchased from third parties with an obligation to resell the securities.
The securities are not recognised as investments in the statement of financial position.
v  The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or has expired.
vi  Consistent with the Groups risk management and investment strategy and the nature of the products concerned, the Group has designated under IAS 39 classification certain financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as these instruments are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.
These instruments include liabilities related to consolidated collateralised debt obligations and net assets attributable to unit holders of consolidated unit trusts and similar funds.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 305 E Further accounting policies Continued  f Segments Under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is internally provided to the Group Executive Committee which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The operating segments identified by the Group reflect the Groups organisational structure, which is by both geography Asia, US and UK and by product line insurance operations and asset management.
The products of the insurance operations contain both significant and insignificant levels of insurance risk.
The products are managed together and there is no distinction between these two categories other than for accounting purposes.
This segment also includes the commission earned on general insurance business and investment subsidiaries held to support the Groups insurance operations.
Asset management comprises both internal and third-party asset management services, inclusive of portfolio and mutual fund management, where the Group acts as an adviser, and broker-dealer activities.
The nature of the products and the managing of the business differ from the risks inherent in the insurance operations segments, and the regulatory environment of the asset management industry differs from that of the insurance operations segments.
Further information on the Groups operating segments is provided in note B1.3.
g Borrowings Although initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, borrowings, excluding liabilities of consolidated collateralised debt obligations, are subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds net of related issue costs is amortised through the income statement to the date of maturity or for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
h Investmentproperties Investments in leasehold and freehold properties not for occupation by the Group, including properties under development for future use as investment properties, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
Properties are valued annually either by the Groups qualified surveyors or by taking into consideration the advice of professional external valuers using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards.
Each property is externally valued at least once every three years.
Leases of investment property where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases leasehold property.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
i Pensionschemes For the Groups defined benefit schemes, if the present value of the defined benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the scheme assets, then a liability is recorded in the Groups statement of financial position.
By contrast, if the fair value of the assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation then the surplus will only be recognised if the nature of the arrangements under the trust deed, and funding arrangements between the Trustee and the Company, support the availability of refunds or recoverability through agreed reductions in future contributions.
In addition, if there is a constructive obligation for the Company to pay deficit funding, this is also recognised such that the financial position recorded for the scheme reflects the higher of any underlying IAS 19 deficit and the obligation for deficit funding.
The Group utilises the projected unit credit method to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
This method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
Estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a high-quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The plan assets of the Groups pension schemes include several insurance contracts that have been issued by the Group.
These assets are excluded from plan assets in determining the pension surplus or deficit recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel, and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset at the start of the period, is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial and other gains and losses as a result of changes in assumptions or experience variances are recognised as other comprehensive income.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are expensed when due.
j  The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a Save As You Earn plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
Shares held in trust relating to these plans are conditionally gifted to employees.
The compensation expense charged to the income statement is primarily based upon the fair value of the options granted, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.
The Company has established trusts to facilitate the delivery of Prudential plc shares under employee incentive plans and savingsrelated share option schemes.
The cost to the Company of acquiring these treasury shares held in trusts is shown as a deduction from shareholders equity.
306 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 05 Financial statements k Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years.
Prudential is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
The positions taken in tax returns where applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept those positions.
Otherwise, provisions are established based on managements estimate and judgement of the likely amount of the liability, or recovery by providing for the single best estimate of the most likely outcome or the weighted average expected value where there are multiple outcomes.
The total tax charge includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders.
The tax expense attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds.
In certain jurisdictions, such as the UK, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders profits and on their policyholders insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products.
Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Groups consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.
Deferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences.
IAS 12 Income Taxes does not require all temporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
l  Business acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting, which adjusts the net assets of the acquired company to fair value at the date of purchase.
The excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill.
Expenses related to acquiring new subsidiaries are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Income and expenses of acquired entities are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Income and expenses of entities sold during the period are included in the income statement up to the date of disposal.
The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between sale proceeds net of selling costs, less the net assets of the entity at the date of disposal, adjusted for foreign exchange movements attaching to the sold entity that are required to be recycled to the income statement under IAS 21. m Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised and carried on the Group statement of financial position as an intangible asset at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill impairment testing is conducted annually and when there is an indication of impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units.
n Intangibleassets Intangible assets acquired on the purchase of a subsidiary or portfolio of contracts are measured at fair value on acquisition.
Deferred acquisition costs are accounted for as described in notes A3.1 d and A3.1 f above.
Other intangible assets, such as distribution rights and software, are valued initially at the price paid to acquire them and are subsequently carried at cost less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Distribution rights relate to fees paid under bancassurance partnership arrangements for bank distribution of products for the term of the contract.
Amounts for distribution rights are amortised on a basis to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by reference to new business production levels.
The same principles apply to determining the amortisation method for other intangible assets unless the pattern cannot be determined reliably, in which case a straight line method is applied.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the acquisition costs and other expenditure line in the consolidated income statement.
o  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly liquid investments with less than 90 days maturity from the date of acquisition.
p  Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 307 E Further accounting policies Continued  q Sharecapital Where there is no obligation to transfer assets, shares are classified as equity.
The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued, is credited to share premium.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from retained earnings.
Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to retained earnings net of related costs.
r Foreignexchange The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Groups presentation currency.
Accordingly, the results and financial position of foreign subsidiaries must be translated into the presentation currency of the Group from their functional currencies, ie the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are converted at year end exchange rates while all income and expenses are converted at average exchange rates where this is a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing on transaction dates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded as a separate component in the statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency borrowings that are used to provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates and movements recognised in other comprehensive income.

By contrast, EEV is a way of reporting the value of the life insurance business.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the amended EEV Principles dated April 2016, prepared by the CFO Forum of major European insurers.
The 2016 results for UK insurance operations have been prepared to reflect the Solvency II regime.
The 2015 results for UK insurance operations were prepared reflecting the Solvency I basis, being the regime applicable for the year.
There is no change to the basis of preparation for Asia and US operations.
The EEV Principles provide consistent definitions, a framework for setting actuarial assumptions, and an approach to the underlying methodology and disclosures.
Results prepared under the EEV Principles capture the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the current book of long-term business.
The results are prepared by projecting cash flows, by product, using best estimate assumptions for all relevant factors.
Furthermore, in determining these expected profits, full allowance is made for the risks attached to their emergence and the associated cost of capital, taking into account recent experience in assessing likely future persistency, mortality, morbidity and expenses.

co. uk 06 European Embedded Value EEV basis results Notes on the EEV basis results 1Basisofpreparation The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the EEV Principles dated April 2016, prepared by the European Insurance CFO Forum.
There is no change to the EEV methodology.
The 2016 results for UK insurance operations have been prepared on a basis that reflects the Solvency II regime, as discussed in note 2 below.
The 2015 comparative results for UK insurance operations were prepared reflecting the Solvency I basis, being the regime applicable for the year.
There is no change to the basis of preparation for Asia and the US operations.
Where appropriate, the EEV basis results include the effects of adoption of EU-endorsed IFRS.
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the supplementary information in accordance with the EEV Principles.
Except for the change in presentation of the results of the operating and non-operating results for Asia operations to show separately the contribution from the held for sale Korea life business see note 17 for details, the 2015 results have been derived from the EEV basis results supplement to the Companys statutory accounts for 2015.
A detailed description of the EEV methodology and accounting presentation is provided in note 14.
 The Solvency II framework is effective from 1 January 2016.
For our operations in Asia and the US there is no impact on the EEV results since Solvency II does not act as the local constraint on the ability to distribute profits to the Group.
The embedded value for these businesses will continue to be driven by local regulatory and target capital requirements.
For the UK insurance operations, Solvency II has an impact on the EEV results as it changes the local regulatory valuation of net worth and capital requirements, affecting the components of the EEV.
The impact of Solvency II on EEV shareholders equity on 1 January 2016 is shown below:  m As reported at 31 December 2015 32,359 Opening adjustment at 1 January 2016 for long-term business operations note a Effect of implementation of Solvency II on net worth 2,760 note b Effect of implementation of Solvency II on net value of in-force business VIF 3,233 473 note c Group total shareholders equity as at 1 January 2016 31,886 Notes a The Solvency II framework requires technical provisions to be valued on a best estimate basis and capital requirements to be risk-based.
It also requires the establishment of a risk margin which for business in force at 31 December 2015 can be broadly offset by transitional measures.
As a result of applying this framework the EEV net worth increased by 2,760 million reflecting the release of the prudent regulatory margins previously included under Solvency I, and also from the recognition within net worth of a portion of future shareholder transfers expected from the with-profits fund.
The higher net worth incorporated increases in required capital reflecting the higher solvency capital requirements of the new regime.
b The net value of in-force business VIF is correspondingly impacted as follows: t he release of prudent regulatory margins and recognition of a portion of future with-profits business shareholders transfers within net worth lead to a corresponding reduction in the VIF: t he run-off of the risk margin, net of transitional measures, is now captured in VIF: and t he cost of capital deducted from the gross VIF increases as a result of the higher Solvency II capital requirements.
The overall impact of these changes was to reduce the value of in-force by 3,233 million.
c At 1 January 2016 the effect of these changes was a net reduction in EEV shareholders equity of 473 million.
The impact of Solvency II in 2016 for UK insurance operations is estimated to have reduced total operating profit from new and in-force business by 39 million.

c The spread assumption for Jackson is determined on a longer-term basis, net of provision for defaults see note 15 ii.
The spread experience variance in 2016 of 119 million 2015: 149 million includes the positive effect of transactions previously undertaken to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration.
The reduction compared to the prior year reflects the effects of declining yields in the portfolio caused by the prolonged low interest rate environment.
d The amortisation of interest-related gains and losses reflects the fact that when bonds that are neither impaired nor deteriorating are sold and reinvested there will be a consequent change in the investment yield.
The realised gain or loss is amortised into the result over the period when the bonds would have otherwise matured to better reflect the long-term returns included in operating profits.

Notes a The decrease in unwind of discount and expected returns of 43 million from 2015 of 488 million to 445 million for 2016 comprises a positive 25 million effect for the underlying growth in the in-force book, more than offset by a 38 million effect driven by the 70 basis points decrease in the 15-year gilt yield during the year and a negative 30 million representing the net effect of adopting the Solvency II regime.
b The credit of 25 million 2015: 55 million for the reduction in UK corporate tax rate reflects the beneficial effect of applying a lower corporation tax rate see note 15 to future life profits from in-force business in the UK.

e In response to the findings of the FCAs Thematic Review of Annuities Sales Practices, the UK business will review all internally vesting annuities sold without advice after 1 July 2008.
Reflecting this, the UK 2016 result includes a provision of 145 million post-tax for the estimated cost of the review and any appropriate customer redress, but excludes any potential for insurance recoveries.

Note The positive effect for 2016 of 70 million largely arises from the movements in long-term interest rates see note 15 i. Non-operating profits arise from higher interest rates and hence fund earned rates in Hong Kong, together with the beneficial impact of valuing future health and protection profits at lower discount rates in Indonesia.
Losses arise from a fall in interest rates in Singapore and a higher discount rate in Malaysia.
iii USoperations The effect of changes in economic assumptions for US operations comprises: 2016 m 2015 m Variable annuity business 86 104 Fixed annuity and other general account business 41 5 note Total US operations 45 109 Note For 2016, the credit of 45 million mainly reflects the increase in the assumed separate account return and reinvestment rates for variable annuity business, following the 20 basis points increase in the US 10-year treasury yield, resulting in higher projected fee income and a decrease in projected benefit costs.
For fixed annuity and other general account business, the impact reflects the effect on the present value of future projected spread income of applying a higher discount rate on the opening value of the in-force book.
iv  The effect of changes in economic assumptions for UK insurance operations comprises: 2016 m 2015 m note a Shareholder-backed annuity business 113 56 note b With-profits and other business 62 152 Total UK insurance operations 175 96 The 2016 results for UK insurance operations have been prepared on a basis that reflects the Solvency II regime effective from 1 January 2016 see note 2 for details.
Notes a For shareholder-backed annuity business the overall negative effect of 113 million for 2016 2015: 56 million reflects an increase in the cost of capital, driven by the lower interest rates, partially offset by the change in the present value of projected spread income arising mainly from the adoption of lower risk discount rates as shown in note 15 iii.
b The charge of 62 million for 2016 2015: credit of 152 million reflects the net effect of changes in expected future fund earned rates and risk discount rates as shown in note 15 iii.

Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the net worth so that backing assets are included at fair value rather than cost so as to comply with the EEV Principles.
Free surplus for asset management operations and the UK general insurance commission is taken to be IFRS basis post-tax earnings and shareholders equity, net of goodwill.
Free surplus for other operations is taken to be EEV basis post-tax earnings and shareholders equity for central operations, net of goodwill, with subordinated debt recorded as free surplus to the extent that it is classified as available capital under Solvency II.

co. uk 06 European Embedded Value EEV basis results  The discounted value of in-force business and required capital can be reconciled to the 2016 and 2015 totals for the emergence of free surplus as follows: 2016 m 2015 m note 10 Required capital 10,296 9,282 note 10 Value of in-force business VIF 24,937 19,198 note 10 Add back: deduction for cost of time value of guarantees 998 1,100 note 17 Expected free surplus generation from the sale of Korea life business 76 note Other items 1,430 1,714 Total 34,725 27,866 In order to show the cash flows for UK insurance operations on a comparable basis, the 2015 comparative results for UK insurance operations reflect the impact of the implementation of Solvency II at 1 January 2016 see note 2 for details.
Note Other items represent amounts incorporated into VIF where there is no definitive time frame for when the payments will be made or receipts received.
In particular, other items include the deduction of the shareholders interest in the estate, the value of which is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
This is an assumption to give an appropriate valuation.
To be conservative this item is excluded from the expected free surplus generation profile below.
Cash flows are projected on a deterministic basis and are discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups EEV reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
The table below shows how the VIF generated by the in-force business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over future years.
In order to show the cash flows for UK insurance operations on a comparable basis, the 2015 comparative results for UK insurance operations reflect the impact of the implementation of Solvency II at 1 January 2016 see note 2 for details.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 345 Notes on the EEV basis results Continued  a  The tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 and the new business contribution after the effect of required capital for 2016 and 2015 to: 1 per cent increase in the discount rates: 1 per cent increase in interest rates, including all consequential changes assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : 0.5 per cent decrease in interest rates 1 per cent decrease for 2015, including all consequential changes assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates : 1 per cent rise in equity and property yields: 10 per cent fall in market value of equity and property assets embedded value only : The statutory minimum capital level by contrast to EEV basis required capital for embedded value only : and 5 basis points increase in UK long-term expected defaults.
To reflect the current level of low interest rates, the sensitivity of new business contribution and embedded value to a 0.5 per cent reduction in interest rates is shown for 2016.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.

If the change in assumptions shown in the sensitivities were to occur, then the effect shown above would be recorded within two components of the profit analysis for the following year.
These are for the effect of economic assumption changes and short-term fluctuations in investment returns.
In addition to the sensitivity effects shown above, the other components of the profit for the following year would be calculated by reference to the altered assumptions, for example new business contribution and unwind of discount, together with the effect of other changes such as altered corporate bond spreads.
In addition for changes in interest rates, the effect shown above for Jackson would also be recorded within the fair value movements on assets backing surplus and required capital, which are taken directly to shareholders equity.

co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 347 Notes on the EEV basis results Continued  a Methodology Overview The embedded value is the present value of the shareholders interest in the earnings distributable from assets allocated to covered business after sufficient allowance has been made for the aggregate risks in that business.
The shareholders interest in the Groups long-term business comprises: The present value of future shareholder cash flows from in-force covered business value of in-force business, less deductions for: The cost of locked-in required capital: and The time value of cost of options and guarantees: Locked-in required capital: and The shareholders net worth in excess of required capital free surplus.
The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value.
Notwithstanding the basis of presentation of results as explained in note 14 b iii, no smoothing of market or account balance values, unrealised gains or investment return is applied in determining the embedded value or profit.
Separately, the analysis of profit is delineated between operating profit based on longer-term investment returns and other constituent items, as explained in note 14 b i. i Coveredbusiness The EEV results for the Group are prepared for covered business, as defined by the EEV Principles.
Covered business represents the Groups long-term insurance business, including the Groups investments in joint venture and associate insurance operations, for which the value of new and in-force contracts is attributable to shareholders.
The post-tax EEV basis results for the Groups covered business are then combined with the post-tax IFRS basis results of the Groups asset management and other operations.
Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management, as described in note 14 a vii.
The definition of long-term business operations comprises those contracts falling under the definition for regulatory purposes together with, for US operations, contracts that are in substance the same as guaranteed investment contracts GICs but do not fall within the technical definition.
Covered business comprises the Groups long-term business operations, with two exceptions: The closed Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF which is excluded from covered business.
SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance Company PAC long-term fund, established by a Court-Approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997.
SAIF is closed to new business and the assets and liabilities of the fund are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
The presentational treatment of the Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
The partial recognition of the surplus for PSPS is recognised in Other operations.
A small amount of UK group pensions business is also not modelled for EEV reporting purposes.
ii  The embedded value results are prepared incorporating best estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, expenses, persistency, mortality and morbidity, as described in note 15.
These assumptions are used to project future cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the non-diversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.
New business In determining the EEV basis value of new business, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing annual and single premium business as set out for statutory basis reporting.
New business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment products for IFRS basis reporting.
New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.
Internal vesting business is classified as new business where the contracts include an open market option.
The post-tax contribution from new business represents profits determined by applying operating assumptions as at the end of the year.
For UK immediate annuity business and single premium Universal Life products in Asia, primarily in Singapore, the new business contribution is determined by applying economic assumptions reflecting point-of-sale market conditions.
This is consistent with how the business is priced as crediting rates are linked to yields on specific assets and the yield is locked in when the assets are purchased at the point of sale of the policy.
For other business within the Group, end-of-year economic assumptions are used.
New business profitability is a key metric for the Groups management of the development of the business.
In addition, post-tax new business margins are shown by reference to annual premium equivalents APE and the present value of new business premiums PVNBP.
These margins are calculated as the percentage of the value of new business profit to APE and PVNBP.
APE is calculated as the aggregate of regular premiums and one-tenth of single premiums.
PVNBP is calculated as equalling single premiums plus the present value of expected premiums of regular premium new business, allowing for lapses and other assumptions made in determining the EEV new business contribution.
348 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 06 European Embedded Value EEV basis results Valuation movements on investments With the exception of debt securities held by Jackson, investment gains and losses during the year to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included directly in the profit for the year and shareholders equity as they arise.
The results for any covered business conceptually reflect the aggregate of the IFRS results and the movements on the additional shareholders interest recognised on the EEV basis.
Thus the start point for the calculation of the EEV results for Jackson, as for other businesses, reflects the market value movements recognised on an IFRS basis.
However, in determining the movements on the additional shareholders interest, the basis for calculating the EEV result for Jackson acknowledges that, for debt securities backing liabilities, the aggregate EEV results reflect the fact that the value of in-force business instead incorporates the discounted value of future spread earnings.
This value is not affected generally by short-term market movements on securities that, broadly speaking, are held for the longer term.
Fixed income securities backing the free surplus and required capital for Jackson are accounted for at fair value.
However, consistent with the treatment applied under IFRS for Jackson securities classified as available-for-sale, movements in unrealised appreciation depreciation on these securities are accounted for in equity rather than in the income statement, as shown in the movement in shareholders equity.
iii Costofcapital A charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of locked-in required capital supporting the Groups long-term business.
The cost is the difference between the nominal value of the capital and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital, allowing for post-tax investment earnings on the capital.
The annual result is affected by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit and generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.
Where required capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of required capital.
iv  Nature of financial options and guarantees in Prudentials long-term business Asia operations Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described below in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts principally written in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements.
There are also various non-participating long-term products with guarantees.
The principal guarantees are those for whole-of-life contracts with floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception and do not vary subsequently with market conditions.
US operations Jackson The principal financial options and guarantees in Jackson are associated with the fixed annuity FA and variable annuity VA lines of business.
Fixed annuities provide that, at Jacksons discretion, it may reset the interest rate credited to policyholders accounts, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The guaranteed minimum return varies from 1.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent for both years, depending on the particular product, jurisdiction where issued, and date of issue.
For 2016, 87 per cent 2015: 87 per cent of the account values on fixed annuities are for policies with guarantees of 3 per cent or less.
The average guarantee rate is 2.6 per cent 2015: 2.6 per cent.
Fixed annuities also present a risk that policyholders will exercise their option to surrender their contracts in periods of rapidly rising interest rates, possibly requiring Jackson to liquidate assets at an inopportune time.
Jackson issues VA contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contract holder either: a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals: b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return: or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the specified contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable upon depletion of funds Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit GMWB, as death benefits Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits GMDB, or as income benefits Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits GMIB.
These guarantees generally protect the policyholders value in the event of poor equity market performance.
Jackson hedges the GMWB and GMDB guarantees through the use of equity options and futures contracts, and fully reinsures the GMIB guarantees.
Jackson also issues fixed index annuities FIA that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return while providing a guaranteed minimum return.
The guaranteed minimum returns are of a similar nature to those described above for fixed annuities.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 349 Notes on the EEV basis results Continued  UK insurance operations For covered business, the only significant financial options and guarantees in the UK insurance operations arise in the with-profits fund.
With-profits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonus annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike annual bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The PAC with-profits fund also held a provision on the Solvency II basis of 62 million at 31 December 2016 Pillar I Peak 2 basis at 31 December 2015: 47 million to honour guarantees on a small number of guaranteed annuity option products.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuity options in the UK is through the non-covered business of SAIF.
A provision on the Solvency II basis of 571 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2016 Pillar I Peak 2 basis at 31 December 2015: 412 million to honour the guarantees.
As described in note 14 a i, the assets and liabilities are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
Therefore the movement in the provision has no direct impact on shareholders funds.
Time value The value of financial options and guarantees comprises two parts: The first part arises from a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value : and The second part arises from the variability of economic outcomes in the future the time value.
Where appropriate, a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the time value of the financial options and guarantees.
The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of long-term economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with an allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in notes 15 iv, v and vi.
In deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to investment allocation decisions, levels of reversionary and terminal bonuses and credited rates.
Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions.
In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options actually available to management.
For the PAC with-profits fund, the actions assumed are consistent with those set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management which explains how regular and final bonus rates within the discretionary framework are determined, subject to the general legislative requirements applicable.
v  In adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based required capital on its internal targets subject to it being at least the local statutory minimum requirements.
For with-profits business written in a segregated life fund, as is the case in Asia and the UK, the capital available in the fund is sufficient to meet the required capital requirements.
Following the implementation of Solvency II which became effective on 1 January 2016, a portion of future shareholder transfers expected from the with-profits fund is recognised within net worth, together with the associated capital requirements.
For shareholder-backed business the following capital requirements apply: Asia operations: the level of required capital has been set to an amount at least equal to the higher of local statutory requirements and the internal target: US operations: the level of required capital has been set at 250 per cent of the risk-based capital RBC required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC at the Company Action Level CAL : and UK insurance operations: the capital requirements are set at the Solvency II Solvency Capital Requirement SCR for shareholderbacked business as a whole: for 2015, the capital requirements were set to an amount at least equal to the higher of Solvency I Pillar I and Pillar II requirements for shareholder-backed business as a whole.
vi  The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the PAC with-profits fund has been based on the present level of 10 per cent.
The value attributed to the shareholders interest in the estate is derived by increasing final bonus rates and related shareholder transfers so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
In any scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders.
Similar principles apply, where appropriate, for other with-profits funds of the Groups Asia operations.
350 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 06 European Embedded Value EEV basis results vii  The in-force and new business results from long-term business include the projected value of profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered insurance businesses.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the current year profits from the management of both internal and external funds.
EEV basis shareholders other income and expenditure is adjusted to deduct the unwind of the expected internal asset management profit margin for the year.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of management of the assets for covered business.
viii  Overview Under the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows are set by reference to risk-free rates plus a risk margin.
For Asia and US operations, the risk-free rates are based on 10-year local government bond yields.
For UK insurance operations, following the implementation of Solvency II on 1 January 2016, the EEV risk-free rate is based on the full term structure of interest rates, ie a yield curve, rather than using a flat 15-year gilt yield as for 2015.
This yield curve is used to determine the embedded value at the end of the reporting period.
The risk margin should reflect any non-diversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation.
Prudential has selected a granular approach to better reflect differences in market risk inherent in each product group.
The risk discount rate so derived does not reflect an overall Group market beta but instead reflects the expected volatility associated with the cash flows for each product category in the embedded value model.
Since financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, discount rates under EEV are set excluding the effect of these product features.
The risk margin represents the aggregate of the allowance for market risk, additional allowance for credit risk where appropriate, and allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risk.
No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
Market risk allowance The allowance for market risk represents the beta multiplied by an equity risk premium.
Except for UK shareholder-backed annuity business as explained below such an approach has been used for the Groups businesses.
The beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk.
The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product cash flows.
These are determined by considering how the profits from each product are affected by changes in expected returns on various asset classes.
By converting this into a relative rate of return it is possible to derive a product-specific beta.
Product level betas reflect the most recent product mix to produce appropriate betas and risk discount rates for each major product grouping.
Additional credit risk allowance The Groups methodology is to allow appropriately for credit risk.
The allowance for total credit risk is to cover: Expected long-term defaults: Credit risk premium to reflect the volatility in downgrade and default levels : and Short-term downgrades and defaults.
These allowances are initially reflected in determining best estimate returns and through the market risk allowance described above.
However, for those businesses largely backed by holdings of debt securities these allowances in the projected returns and market risk allowances may not be sufficient and an additional allowance may be appropriate.
The practical application of the allowance for credit risk varies depending upon the type of business as described below: Asia operations For Asia operations, the allowance for credit risk incorporated in the projected rates of return and the market risk allowance are sufficient.
Accordingly, no additional allowance for credit risk is required.
The projected rates of return for holdings of corporate bonds comprise the risk-free rate plus an assessment of long-term spread over the risk-free rate.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 351 Notes on the EEV basis results Continued  US operations Jackson For Jackson business, the allowance for long-term defaults is reflected in the risk margin reserve RMR charge which is deducted in determining the projected spread margin between the earned rate on the investments and the policyholder crediting rate.
The risk discount rate incorporates an additional allowance for credit risk premium and short-term downgrades and defaults as shown in note 15 ii.
In determining this allowance a number of factors have been considered.
These factors, in particular, include: How much of the credit spread on debt securities represents an increased credit risk not reflected in the RMR long-term default assumptions, and how much is liquidity premium which is the premium required by investors to compensate for the risk of longerterm investments which cannot be easily converted into cash, and converted at the fair market value.
In assessing this effect, consideration has been given to a number of approaches to estimating the liquidity premium by considering recent statistical data: and Policyholder benefits for Jackson fixed annuity business are not fixed.
It is possible in adverse economic scenarios to pass on a component of credit losses to policyholders subject to guarantee features through lower investment return rates credited to policyholders.
Consequently, it is only necessary to allow for the balance of the credit risk in the risk discount rate.
The level of the additional allowance is assessed at each reporting period to take account of prevailing credit conditions and as the business inforce alters over time.
The additional allowance for variable annuity business has been set at one-fifth of the non-variable annuity business to reflect the proportion of the allocated holdings of general account debt securities.
The level of allowance differs from that for UK annuity business for investment portfolio differences and to take account of the management actions available in adverse economic scenarios to reduce crediting rates to policyholders, subject to guarantee features of the products.
UK operations 1  For Prudentials UK shareholder-backed annuity business, Prudential has used a market consistent embedded value MCEV approach to derive an implied risk discount rate which is then applied to the projected best estimate cash flows.
In the annuity MCEV calculations, as the assets are generally held to maturity to match liabilities, the future cash flows are discounted using the swap yield curve plus an allowance for liquidity premium based on the Solvency II allowance for credit risk.
The Solvency II allowance is set by European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority EIOPA using a prudent assumption that all future downgrades will be replaced annually, and allowing for the credit spread floor.
For the purposes of presentation in the EEV results, the results on this basis are reconfigured.
Under this approach the projected earned rate of return on the debt securities held is determined after allowing for a best estimate credit risk allowance.
The remaining elements of prudence within the Solvency II allowance are incorporated into the risk margin included in the discount rate, shown in note 14 iii.
In 2015, the allowance for liquidity premium was based on Prudentials assessment of the expected return on the assets backing the annuity liabilities after allowing for expected long-term defaults, a credit risk premium, an allowance for a 1-notch downgrade of the asset portfolio subject to credit risk: and an allowance for short-term downgrades and defaults.
2  For UK non-profit annuity business including that attributable to the PAC with-profits fund, the basis for determining the aggregate allowance for credit risk is consistent with that applied for UK shareholder-backed annuity business as described above.
The allowance for credit risk for this business is taken into account in determining the projected cash flows to the with-profits fund, which are in turn discounted at the risk discount rate applicable to all of the projected cash flows of the fund.
3  The UK with-profits fund holds debt securities as part of its investment portfolio backing policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
The assumed earned rate for with-profit holdings of corporate bonds is defined as the risk-free rate plus an assessment of the long-term spread over risk-free, net of expected long-term defaults.
This approach is similar to that applied for equities and properties for which the projected earned rate is defined as the risk-free rate plus a long-term risk premium.
Allowance for non-diversifiable non-market risks The majority of non-market and non-credit risks are considered to be diversifiable.
Finance theory cannot be used to determine the appropriate component of beta for non-diversifiable non-market risks since there is no observable risk premium associated with it that is akin to the equity risk premium.
Recognising this, a pragmatic approach has been applied.
A base level allowance of 50 basis points is applied to cover the non-diversifiable non-market risks associated with the Groups businesses.
For the Groups Asia operations in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, additional allowances are applied for emerging market risk ranging from 100 to 250 basis points.
For the Groups US business and UK business, no additional allowance is necessary.
In 2015, for UK shareholder-backed annuity business, a further allowance of 50 basis points was used to reflect the longevity risk, which is covered by the solvency capital requirements following the implementation of Solvency II from 1 January 2016.
352 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 06 European Embedded Value EEV basis results ix  Foreign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at year-end exchange rates.
The principal exchange rates are shown in note A1 of the IFRS financial statements.
x Taxation In determining the post-tax profit for the year for covered business, the overall tax rate includes the impact of tax effects determined on a local regulatory basis.
Tax payments and receipts included in the projected cash flows to determine the value of in-force business are calculated using rates that have been announced and substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
xi  The EEV results for covered business incorporate annuities established in the PAC non-profit sub-fund from vesting pension policies in SAIF which is not covered business.
The EEV results also incorporate the effect of the reinsurance arrangement of non-profit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to the PAC non-profit sub-fund.
b  i  To the extent applicable, the presentation of the EEV post-tax profit for the year is consistent in the classification between operating and non-operating results with the basis that the Group applies for the analysis of IFRS basis results.
Operating results reflect underlying results including longer-term investment returns which are determined as described in note 14 b ii and incorporate the following: New business contribution, as defined in note 14 a ii : Unwind of discount on the value of in-force business and other expected returns, as described in note 14 b iii : The impact of routine changes of estimates relating to operating assumptions, as described in note 14 b iv : and Operating experience variances, as described in note 14 b v. Non-operating results comprise the recurrent items of: Short-term fluctuations in investment returns: The mark to market value movements on core borrowings: and The effect of changes in economic assumptions.
In addition, non-operating profit also includes the effect of adjustment to the carrying value of the held for sale Korea life business in 2016 and a reclassification of the result attributable to the held for sale Korea life business in both years see note 17 for details.
Total profit attributable to shareholders and basic earnings per share include these items, together with actual investment returns.
The Group believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
ii  For the investment element of the assets covering the net worth of long-term insurance business, investment returns are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
These expected returns are calculated by reference to the asset mix of the portfolio.
For the purpose of calculating the longer-term investment return to be included in the operating result of the PAC with-profits fund of UK operations, where assets backing the liabilities and unallocated surplus are subject to market volatility, asset values at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market movements as explained in note 14 b iii.
For the purpose of determining the long-term returns for debt securities of US operations for fixed annuity and other general account business, a risk margin charge is included which reflects the expected long-term rate of default based on the credit quality of the portfolio.
For Jackson, interest-related realised gains and losses are amortised to the operating results over the maturity period of the sold bonds and for equity-related investments, a long-term rate of return is assumed, which reflects the aggregation of end-of-period risk-free rates and equity risk premium.
For US variable annuity separate account business, operating profit includes the unwind of discount on the opening value of in-force business adjusted to reflect end-of-period projected rates of return with the excess or deficit of the actual return recognised within non-operating profit, together with the related hedging activity.
For UK annuity business, rebalancing of the asset portfolio backing the liabilities to policyholders may, from time to time, take place to align it more closely with the internal benchmark of credit quality that management applies.
Such rebalancing will result in a change in the projected yield on the asset portfolio and the allowance for default risk.
The net effect of these changes is included in the operating result for the year.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 353 Notes on the EEV basis results Continued  iii  The unwind of discount and other expected returns is determined by reference to: The value of in-force business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current year economic and operating assumption changes : and Required capital and surplus assets.
UK operations In applying this general approach, the unwind of discount included in operating profit is determined by reference to the following: The unwind is determined by reference to an implied single risk discount rate for 2016.
Following the implementation of Solvency II the EEV risk-free rate is based on a yield curve as set out in note 14a viii, which is used to derive a single implied discount rate which, if this rate had been used, would reproduce the same embedded value as that calculated by reference to the yield curve.
The difference between the operating profit determined using the single implied discount rate and that derived using the yield curve is included within non-operating profit: and For with-profits business, the opening value of in-force is adjusted for the effect of short-term investment volatility due to market movements ie smoothed.
In the summary statement of financial position and for total profit reporting, asset values and investment returns are not smoothed.
At 31 December 2016, the shareholders interest in the smoothed surplus assets used for this purpose only were 77 million lower 31 December 2015: 58 million lower than the surplus assets carried in the statement of financial position.
iv  Operating profit includes the effect of changes to non-economic assumptions on the value of in-force at the end of the year.
For presentational purposes the effect of changes is delineated to show the effect on the opening value of in-force as operating assumption changes, with the experience variances subsequently being determined by reference to the end-of-period assumptions see note 14 b v. v  Operating profit includes the effect of experience variances on non-economic assumptions, such as persistency, mortality and morbidity, expenses and other factors, which are calculated with reference to the end-of-period assumptions.
vi  Movements in the value of in-force business at the beginning of the year caused by changes in economic assumptions, net of the related change in the time value of cost of options and guarantees, are recorded in non-operating results.
For UK insurance operations, the effect is after allowing for the recalculation of transitional measures on technical provisions.
15Assumptions  The EEV basis results for the Groups operations have been determined using economic assumptions where the long-term expected rates of return on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to year-end risk-free rates of return defined below for each of the Groups insurance operations.
Expected returns on equity and property asset classes and corporate bonds are derived by adding a risk premium, based on the Groups long-term view, to the risk-free rate.
The total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated using the embedded value basis is the same as that calculated under the IFRS basis.
Since the embedded value basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under this methodology the profit emergence is advanced, thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profit with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to business sold during the year.

The changes in the risk discount rates for individual Asia territories reflect the movements in 10-year government bond yields, together with the effects of movements in the allowance for market risk and changes in product mix.

co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 355 Notes on the EEV basis results Continued  iii  Effective from 1 January 2016, following the implementation of Solvency II, the EEV risk-free rate is based on the full term structure of interest rates, ie a yield curve, which is used to determine the embedded value at the end of the reporting period.
For 2016, these yield curves are used to derive pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return and risk discount rates.
For the purpose of determining the unwind of discount in the analysis of operating profit, these yield curves are used to derive a single implied risk discount rate, as explained in note 14 a viii.
For 2015, risk-free rates of return and risk discount rates were based on a flat 15-year gilt yield at the end of the year.
The key economic assumptions are shown below for both years, for 2016 the single implied risk discount rate is shown, along with the 15-year nominal rate of return based on the yield curve.
For 2015 the long-term nominal rates of return are shown.

Notes a For shareholder-backed annuity business, the movements in the pre-tax long-term nominal rates of return and risk discount rates for new and in-force businesses reflect the effect of changes in asset yields based on average yields for new business.

iv Asiaoperations The stochastic cost of guarantees is primarily of significance for the Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan operations: The principal asset classes are government and corporate bonds: The asset return models are similar to the models as described for UK insurance operations below: and The volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 35 per cent, and the volatility of government bond yields ranges from 0.9 per cent to 2.3 per cent for both years.
v USoperations Jackson Interest rates and equity returns are projected using a log-normal generator reflecting historical market data: Corporate bond returns are based on treasury yields plus a spread that reflects current market conditions: and The volatility of equity returns ranges from 18 per cent to 27 per cent for both years, and the standard deviation of interest rates ranges from 2.3 per cent to 2.6 per cent 2015: from 2.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
356 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 06 European Embedded Value EEV basis results vi  Interest rates are projected using a stochastic interest rate model calibrated to the current market yields: Equity returns are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution: The corporate bond return is calculated based on a risk-free return plus a mean-reverting spread: Property returns are also modelled on a risk-free return plus a risk premium with a stochastic process reflecting total property returns: and The standard deviation of equities and property ranges from 15 per cent to 20 per cent for both years.
Operatingassumptions  Best estimate assumptions are used for the cash flow projections, where best estimate is defined as the mean of the distribution of future possible outcomes.
The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain.
Assumptions required in the calculation of the value of options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.
Demographic assumptions Persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience, but also reflect expected future experience.
Where relevant, when calculating the time value of financial options and guarantees, policyholder withdrawal rates vary in line with the emerging investment conditions according to managements expectations.
Expense assumptions Expense levels, including those of service companies that support the Groups long-term business operations, are based on internal expense analysis investigations and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of in-force business.
Exceptional expenses are identified and reported separately.
For mature business, it is Prudentials policy not to take credit for future cost reduction programmes until the savings have been delivered.
For businesses which are currently sub-scale China, Malaysia Takaful and Taiwan, expense overruns are reported where these are expected to be short-lived.
For Asia operations, the expenses comprise costs borne directly and recharged costs from the Asia regional head office, that are attributable to covered business.
The assumed future expenses for these operations also include projections of these future recharges.
Development expenses are charged as incurred.
Corporate expenditure, which is included in other income and expenditure, comprises: Expenditure for Group head office, to the extent not allocated to the PAC with-profits funds, together with Solvency II implementation and restructuring costs, which are charged to the EEV basis results as incurred: and Expenditure of the Asia regional head office that is not allocated to the covered business or asset management operations which is charged as incurred.
These costs are primarily for corporate-related activities and are included within corporate expenditure.
Taxrates The assumed long-term effective tax rates for operations reflect the incidence of taxable profits and losses in the projected cash flows as explained in note 14 a x.
The local standard corporate tax rates applicable for the most significant operations for 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  % Asia operations: Hong Kong 16.5 per cent on 5 per cent of premium income Indonesia 25.0 Malaysia 2015: 25.0: from 2016: 24.0 Singapore 17.0 US operations 35.0 UK operations 2015: 20.0: from 2017: 19.0: from 2020: 17.0 The Finance Bill included a reduction in the UK corporate tax rate from 18 per cent to 17 per cent effective from 1 April 2020.
The impact of this reduction on the UK in-force business is shown in note 5 iv b. www.

Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
Consistent with the classification of the business as held for sale for IFRS reporting, the EEV carrying value has been set to 105 million at 31 December 2016, representing the estimated proceeds, net of 9 million of related expenses.
In order to facilitate comparisons of the Groups retained businesses, the EEV basis operating profit excludes the contribution from the Korea life business.
The 2015 comparative results have been similarly adjusted.
For 2016, the post-tax result for the year of 5 million, including short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the effect of changes in economic assumptions, together with the 415 million adjustment to the carrying value have given rise to an aggregate loss of 410 million.
The 2015 amount of 39 million represents the previously reported profit after tax for this business.
