STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION As the plans mature, with a shorter time horizon to cope with volatility, the Group will gradually reduce holdings of growth assets in favour of increased matching assets bonds and similar.
In the meantime, the Group considers that equities and similar assets are an appropriate means of managing pension funding requirements, given the long-term nature of the liabilities and the strength of the Group to withstand volatility.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in bond yields will typically increase plan liabilities and vice versa, although this will be offset partially by an increase in the value of bonds held in the asset portfolios of the various plans.
The effect of changes in bond yields is more pronounced in unfunded schemes where there is no potential for an offsetting movement in asset values.
Inflation risk: as UK and some European pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities, although caps are in place to protect against unusually high levels of inflation.
The UK asset portfolio includes some inflation-linked bonds to provide an element of protection against this risk, while additional protection is provided by inflation derivatives.
Member longevity: as the Groups post-employment obligations are generally to provide benefits for the life of the member, increases in life expectancy will generally result in an increase in plan liabilities and vice versa.
d Defined benefit schemes demographic factors Weighted average duration is a measurement technique designed to represent the estimated average time to payment of all cash flows arising as a result of defined benefit obligations i. e. pension payments and similar.
The weighted average duration years of the defined benefit obligations in the UK, US and Germany are as follows: 2016 2015 years years UK GKN1 11 GKN2 19 17 GKN3 11 US 12 13 Germany 18 14 Defined benefit obligations are classified into those representing active members of a scheme or plan i. e. those who are currently employed by the Group, deferred members i. e. those who have accrued benefit entitlements, but who are no longer employed by the Group and are not yet drawing a pension and pensioner members ie.
those who are currently in receipt of a pension.
