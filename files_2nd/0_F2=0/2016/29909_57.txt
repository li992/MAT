Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 9 Earnings losses per share and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings losses per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.
Diluted earnings losses per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options.
The dilutive effect is calculated on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
The Group has recognised a profit for the financial year from its continuing operations therefore the diluted earnings losses per share includes this dilutive antidilutive effect.
Given the loss for the 53 weeks ended 28 February 2015, the Group recognised a basic loss per share rather than a basic earnings per share.
The dilutive effect of the 12m potentially dilutive share options in that year was not considered in calculating the diluted loss per share as it would have reduced the loss per share.
For the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2016 there were 26m potentially dilutive share options.
As the Group has recognised a profit before tax from continuing operations before exceptional items and net pension finance costs attributable to the owners of the parent the dilutive effects have been considered in calculating diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items and net pension finance costs.
