Accordingly, the temporary differences have been calculated at rates between 20% and 17% 2015: 20% and 18%.
The effect of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% is nil 2015: 0.6 million in the income statement and 3.2 million 2015: 2.5 million in the statement of comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity.
Deferred tax continued The net deferred tax balance is analysed into assets and liabilities as follows: million 2016 2015 Deferred tax assets 58.7 57.1 Deferred tax liabilities 1.3 1.4 57.4 55.7 The Group has not recognised temporary differences relating to tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences amounting to 3.0 million 2015: 3.5 million in the UK and 70.0 million 2015: 68.4 million in Spain.
The UK temporary differences have not been recognised as they are predominantly non-trading in nature and insufficient certainty exists as to their future utilisation.
The temporary differences in Spain have not been recognised due to uncertainty of sufficient taxable profits in the future against which to utilise these amounts.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused UK capital losses of 269.5 million 2015: 264.3 million.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the capital losses at 31 December 2016 because the Group does not believe that it is probable that these capital losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.

The Group has seen sustained improvement in the UK housing market and improvement in confidence in the wider economy, driven by continued low interest rates, improved mortgage availability and Government incentives, including the Help to Buy scheme.
This net release consists of 7.7 million of releases 2015: 6.6 million and additional write-downs on previously impaired sites, due to site specific rather than market factors, of 5.5 million 2015: 7.2 million.
In the year 5% 2015: 6% of the Groups UK completions were from pre-2009 impaired sites.
At the balance sheet date the Group held inventory in the UK that had been written down to net realisable value of 119.6 million 2015: 151.6 million with associated impairments of 96.8 million 2015: 124.2 million.
The UK net realisable value assessment of inventory is highly sensitive to small changes in judgements and the table below provides an indication of the impact to the inventory held on the balance sheet of 1% movements in selling prices and build costs.

The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs level 3, nor have there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group has the following types of derivatives: 2016 2016 2015 2015 Notional Weighted Notional Weighted amount average fixed amount average fixed Designated as hedging instruments: Currency forward contract to sell against 34.0m n a In addition, forward contracts have been entered into to hedge transaction risks on intra-Group loans to buy sell against Sterling: 47.5 million and C$ 0.4 million 2015: 5.3 million and C$ 0.6 million.
The fair value of the forward contracts are not materially different to their book value as they were entered into on or near 31 December in each year and mature less than one month later, hence the value of the derivative is negligible.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group aims to manage the exposure to these risks by the use of fixed or variable rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
a Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borrows funds at variable interest rates.
The exposure to variable rate borrowings fluctuates during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash flows relating to housing sales and the less certain timing of land payments.
Group policy is to manage the volatility risk by a combination of fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps such that the sensitivity to potential changes in variable rates is within acceptable levels.
Group policy does not allow the use of derivatives to speculate against changes to future interest rates and they are only used to manage exposure to volatility.
This policy has not changed during the year.
In order to measure the risk, variable rate borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a monthly basis and compared to budget using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
Interest rate sensitivity The effect on both income and equity, based on exposure to non-derivative floating rate instruments at the balance sheet date, is shown in the table below.
The Group issued 100 million fixed rate loan notes during 2016 and does not currently have any outstanding interest rate derivatives.
The table assumes all other variables remain constant in accordance with IFRS 7.

Financial instruments and fair value disclosures continued b Foreign currency risk management The Groups overseas activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Its Spanish subsidiary is the only foreign operation of the Group.
The Group is not materially exposed to transaction risks as all Group companies conduct their business in their respective functional currencies.
Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency borrowings or derivatives where appropriate.
The Group is also exposed to the translation risk from accounting for both the income and the net investment held in a functional currency other than Sterling.
The net investment risk may be hedged using foreign currency borrowings and derivatives.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies are retranslated each month using the latest exchange rates.
Income is also measured monthly using the latest exchange rates and compared to a budget held at historical exchange rates.
Other than the natural hedge provided by foreign currency borrowings, the translation risk of income is not hedged using derivatives.
The policy is kept under periodic review.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk has changed in the year as a result of the 100 million 2.02% loan notes issued during 2016, to manage the exposure to movements in the net assets of the Spanish operation as a result of fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate against Sterling.
Previously this was done using foreign currency forward contracts.
Hedge accounting Hedging activities are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are in line with Group policy.
During 2016 foreign currency borrowings replaced forward contracts as the designated financial instrument to hedge the net investment risk in the Spanish operations.
The Group has designated the carrying value of 54.0 million of foreign currency borrowings 2015: 34.0 million foreign currency forward contracts held at the balance sheet date as a net investment hedge of part of the Groups investment in Euro denominated assets.
The change in the carrying amount of the derivatives which were effective hedging instruments, and the change in the carrying value of the borrowings, offset the exchange movement on the foreign currency net investments and are presented in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
Foreign currency sensitivity The Group is exposed to the Euro due to its Spanish operations.
The following table details how the Groups income and equity would increase decrease on a before tax basis following a 15% change in the currencys value against Sterling, and in accordance with IFRS 7, all other variables remaining constant.
The 15% change represents a reasonably possible change in the specified Euro exchange rates in relation to Sterling.

Group policy is that surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with the Groups main relationship banks and with other banks or money market funds based on a minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
There is no significant concentration of risk to any single counterparty.
Land receivables arise from sales of surplus land on deferred terms.
A policy is in place such that, if the credit risk is not acceptable, then the deferred payment must have adequate security, either by the use of an appropriate guarantee or a charge over the land.
The fair value of any land held as security is considered by management to be sufficient in relation to the carrying amount of the receivable to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts receivable from various housing associations and other house builders.
Management consider that the credit quality of the various receivables is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
There is no significant concentration of risk.
Mortgage receivables, including shared equity loans, are in connection with the various historical promotion schemes to support sales on a selective basis.
The mortgages are secured by a second charge over the property and are held at amortised cost.
The non-closely related embedded derivative related to shared equity is held at fair value.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets and liabilities with the use of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a minimum of 12 months to maturity.
Future borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast peak requirements to meet unforeseen events.
The Group borrowings have a range of maturities with an average life of 3.6 years 2015: 4.0 years.
Financial instruments and fair value disclosures continued In addition to fixed term borrowings, the Group has access to committed revolving credit facilities and cash balances.
At the balance sheet date, the total unused committed amount was 550.0 million 2015: 550.0 million and cash and cash equivalents were 450.2 million 2015: 323.3 million.
On 28 June 2016 the Group issued 100 million loan notes at a fixed rate of 2.02% maturing 28 June 2023 and in November 2016 pre-paid the 100.0 million term loan maturing in November 2020.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows, including interest using the latest applicable relevant rate based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, is as follows: Overdrafts, Trade and Currency Financial liabilities bank and Land other forward million other loans creditors payables contracts Total On demand Within one year 1.7 286.4 577.1 0.3 865.5 More than one year and less than two years 1.7 178.7 45.8 226.2 More than two years and less than five years 5.2 143.0 43.9 192.1 In more than five years 88.0 21.3 10.8 120.1 31 December 2016 96.6 629.4 677.6 0.3 1,403.9 Excludes land creditors.

Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefit obligations comprise a defined benefit pension liability of 232.7 million 2015: 177.1 million and a post-retirement healthcare liability of 1.4 million 2015: 1.3 million.
The Group operates the Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme TWPS, a defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to both new members and to future accrual.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension arrangements in the UK, which are available to new and existing UK employees.
Defined contribution pension plan A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund such contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of employees pay.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid.
Members benefits are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Group and the member, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to buy at retirement.
As a result, actuarial risk that benefits will be lower than expected and investment risk that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations fall on the employee.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The Groups defined contribution plan, the Taylor Wimpey Personal Choice Plan TWPCP, is offered to all new and existing monthly paid employees.
The Peoples Pension is used for auto enrolment purposes for weekly and monthly employees not participating in the TWPCP.
The Peoples Pension is provided by B&CE, one of the UKs largest providers of financial benefits to construction industry employers and individuals.
The Group made contributions to its defined contribution arrangements of 10.6 million in 2016 2015: 10.0 million, which is included in the income statement charge.
The Group expects to make contributions of around 10.7 million in 2017.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is the TWPS.
The TWPS is a funded defined benefit pension scheme which provides benefits to beneficiaries in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing active accrual if earlier.
Pension payments are generally increased in line with inflation.
The Group operates the TWPS under the UK regulatory framework.
Benefits are paid to members from a Trustee-administered fund and the Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments.
Scheme assets are held in trust.
The TWPS Trustees other duties include managing the investment of scheme assets, administration of scheme benefits and exercising of discretionary powers.
The Group works closely with the Trustees to manage the TWPS.
The Trustees of the TWPS owe fiduciary duties to the TWPS beneficiaries.
The appointment of the Trustees is determined by the TWPS trust documentation.
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and investment outperformance.
In order to assess the level of contributions required, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions.
The first funding valuation of the TWPS was performed during 2014, with an effective date of 31 December 2013.
Subsequently, the Group agreed to make contributions of 18.0 million in 2016, including reimbursement of administrative costs of the scheme.
Contributions to the TWPS pension scheme are not considered to be significant enough to negatively impact future cash flows of the Group.
The next triennial valuation is currently being undertaken with an effective date of 31 December 2016.
In 2013, the Group introduced a 100.0 million Pension Funding Partnership utilising show homes, as well as seven offices which are owned, in a sale and leaseback structure.
This provides an additional 5.1 million of annual funding for the TWPS.
The assets held within this scheme do not affect the IAS 19 figures as they remain assets of the Group, and are not assets of the TWPS.
As at 31 December 2016, there was 101.4 million of property and 9.6 million of cash held within the structure 2015: 91.1 million of property and 19.9 million of cash.
The Group continues to work closely with the Trustees in managing the pension exposure.

The duration, or average term to payment for the benefits due, weighted by liability, is approximately 15 years for the TWPS.
Accounting assumptions The assumptions used in calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the TWPS, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The basis for these assumptions is prescribed by IAS 19 and they do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the TWPS.
The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligations is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with regard for the duration of the TWPS.
The assumption for RPI inflation is set by reference to the Bank of Englands implied inflation curve with regard for the duration of the TWPS, with appropriate adjustments to reflect distortions due to supply and demand for inflation-linked securities.
CPI inflation is set by reference to RPI inflation as no CPI-linked bonds exist to render implied CPI inflation directly observable.
The life expectancies have been derived using mortality assumptions that were based on the results of a recent investigation into the mortality experience of the scheme.
The base tables used for 2016 was the S2NXA tables with CMI 2015 improvements and 1.25% trend rate, including actual 2013 to 2015 death data.
For 2015 the S2NXA tables with CMI 2013 improvements and 1.25% trend rate was used.

These areas of risk, and the ways in which the Group has sought to manage them, are set out in the table on page 135.
The risks are considered from both a funding perspective, which drives the cash commitments of the Group, and from an accounting perspective, i. e. the extent to which such risks affect the amounts recorded in the Groups financial statements.
Although investment decisions in the UK are the responsibility of the Trustees, the Group takes an active interest to ensure that pension scheme risks are managed efficiently.
The Group has regular meetings with the Trustees to discuss investment performance, regulatory changes and proposals to actively manage the deficit.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The key risks of the defined benefit pension scheme are detailed below along with the Groups approach to them.
Risk Description Asset volatility The TWPS undertook a strategic asset allocation review at the end of 2015, with the aim of increasing investment returns whilst decreasing overall risk.
This was implemented over the course of 2016 and involved: Increasing the hedging strategies to further minimise risk to the deficit from changes in interest rates and inflation.
Transitioning the TWPS physical equities to synthetic, risk-managed equity exposure that combines a volatility-targeting mechanism with put option downside protection.
Investing into a pooled fund of diversified risk premia with a view to broadening exposure to a range of less-correlated risk premia to reduce reliance on equity markets for closing the deficit.
With these changes, the funding level is now expected to be less volatile than previously.
However, there is still some risk persistent in the TWPS assets, which could potentially result in short term cash requirements and an increase in the net defined benefit liability recorded on the balance sheet.
In addition to the investments outlined above, the TWPS strategy is well diversified through its exposure to a range of asset classes, including commercial real estate debt, direct lending bonds, hedge funds, government bonds and a broad spectrum of corporate bonds and other fixed income exposures.
Furthermore, there are a number of hedging strategies in place these are mentioned below.
TWPS does not target a specific asset allocation but instead bases its strategic asset allocation on the return objectives and risk constraints agreed upon by the Trustees.
Changes in Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities.
However, the investment in corporate and government bonds bond yields offers a degree of matching, i. e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the movement in the funding or accounting liabilities.
In this way, the exposure to movements in bond yields is reduced.
Investing In order to maintain appropriate diversification of investments within the TWPS assets and to take advantage of overseas investment in foreign returns, a proportion of the underlying investment portfolio is invested overseas.
To balance the risk of investing in foreign currencies currency while having an obligation to settle benefits in Sterling, a currency hedging programme, using forward foreign exchange contracts, has been put in place to reduce the currency exposure of these overseas investments to the targeted level.
Asset liability In order to manage the TWPS economic exposure to interest rates and inflation rates, a liability hedging programme has been put in mismatch place.
Derivatives are being used to hedge changes in TWPS funding level from changes in its liabilities in an unfunded way, substantially reducing asset liability mismatch risk.
Illiquidity Insurance policies, real estate and illiquid debt which include commercial real estate debt and direct lending bonds make up 387 million 18% of the asset portfolio of TWPS.
Excluding these amounts, approximately 74% of assets are managed either in segregated accounts or daily weekly dealt pooled funds and can therefore be realised within a few business days under normal market conditions.
Of the remaining investments, a further 20% are in pooled funds with monthly redemption dates.
The remainder of 6% could be redeemed within approximately three months of notification in normal market conditions.
Life The majority of the TWPS obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member on retirement, so increases in life expectancy expectancy will result in an increase in the TWPS liabilities.
The inflation-linked nature of the majority of benefit payments from the TWPS increases the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in life expectancy.
Additional areas of risk management During the last quarter of 2014, the Group reached agreement with Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited to insure the benefits of certain members through a medically underwritten buy-in.
These members represent the 10% of members with the greatest anticipated liability of the scheme.
By insuring these members, the Group has removed more than 10% of risk from the scheme by significantly reducing the longevity of a large proportion of the liabilities.
The Group remains ultimately liable for the payments, and as such the obligation is unchanged: however the medically underwritten insurance policy has been recognised as a scheme insured asset.
