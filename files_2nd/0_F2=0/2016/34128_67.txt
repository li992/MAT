SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Given the nature of the Groups business, there is one segment, which is the provision of self storage and related services.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage and related services which fall within the Group's ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom in the current year and prior year.
