The Group has used operating lease commitments discounted at 7% 2015: 7% of 7,814m 2015: 9,353m in its calculation of total indebtedness.
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its retail, distribution and office properties and other assets such as motor vehicles.
The leases have varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Purchase options and renewal rights, where they occur, are at market value.
Escalation clauses are in line with market practices and include inflation linked, fixed rates, resets to market rents and hybrids of these.
The Group has lease-break options on certain sale and leaseback transactions.
These options are exercisable if the Group exercises an existing option to buy back, at market value and at a specified date, either the leased asset or the equity of the other joint venture partner.
No commitment has been included in respect of the buy-back option as the option is at the Groups discretion.
The Group is not obliged to pay lease rentals after that date, therefore minimum lease payments exclude those falling after the buy-back date.
The current market value of these properties is 3.2bn 2015: 4.7bn and the total lease rentals, if they were to be incurred following the option exercise date, would be 2.6bn 2015: 3.9bn using current rent values.
The lease break options are exercisable between 2016 and 2023.
