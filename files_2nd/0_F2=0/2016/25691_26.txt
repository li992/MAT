As a result of the shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in sterling, but if you would like to receive your dividend in US dollars please contact the Registrars at the address below.
All shareholders will receive dividends in sterling unless requested.
If you are a UK based shareholder, the Company encourages you to have your dividends paid through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit of the BACS payment method is that the Registrars post the tax vouchers directly to the shareholders, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholders Bank or Building Society account.
UK shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid direct to their Bank or Building Society account and wish to benefit from this service should contact the Registrars at the address below.
Sterling dividends will be translated at the closing mid-point spot rate on 7 April 2017 as published in the Financial Times on 8 April 2017.
