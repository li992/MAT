110 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2016 2015 $m $m Flight Support: Signature Flight Support 1,048.7 496.0 ASIG discontinued operations 70.6 185.9 Aftermarket Services: Engine Repair & Overhaul 140.1 Ontic 65.2 67.6 Total goodwill from continuing and discontinued operations 1,184.5 889.6 Total goodwill from continuing operations 1,113.9 703.7 Total goodwill from discontinu ed operations 70.6 185.9 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has determined the recoverable amount of each CGU from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and detailed financial projections for the next 5 years, as approved by management, with a terminal growth rate after five years.
The resultant cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
Key assumptions The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows.
Sales volumes, selling prices and cost increases over the five years covered by managements detailed plans Sales volumes are based on industry forecasts and management estimates for the businesses in which each CGU operates, including forecasts for Business & General Aviation B&GA flying hours, aircraft engine cycles and US military spending.
Selling prices and cost increases are based on past experience and management expectations of future changes in the market.
The extent to which these assumptions affect each principal CGU with a significant level of goodwill are described below.

In B&GA, growth is measured principally in relation to B&GA flying hours.
Over the longer term, the key drivers for B&GA remain the same as historically continued growth in GDP and total wealth, the increasing value of peoples time, corporate confidence and corporate activity levels.
The unusual nature of the 2007-2009 crisis and the halting return to growth have meant that, although corporate profits have recovered and confidence is now improving, investment in aircraft and flight activity continue to lag.
Modest growth in the economies of the majority of the top 20 business aviation markets worldwide is a key factor affecting new aircraft orders and sales of pre-owned aircraft.
B&GA flight activity in the US continued to grow during 2016, with movements up 1% year on year.
US B&GA monthly flight activity cycles were positive for the majority of the period with growth every month from August, albeit against slightly weak comparator months in 2015.
In Europe, B&GA aircraft movements were up 2% for the year, a significant improvement, but against a weak comparator of -3% in 2015.
Trends in military aviation are likely to improve as the global defence market begins to recover after years of pressure due to budget retrenchment.
Life extension programmes continue to be important as the US military aircraft ages.
The current US Air Force fleet is more than 25 years old on average, with some platforms significantly older.
Average age is expected to continue to rise despite budget increases.
Growth rates used for the periods beyond those covered by managements detailed plans Growth rates are derived from managements estimates, which take into account the long-term nature of the industry in which each CGU operates, external industry forecasts of long-term growth in the aerospace and defence sectors, the maturity of the platforms supplied by the CGU and the technological content of the CGUs products.
For the purpose of impairment testing, a conservative approach has been used and where the derived rate is higher than the long-term GDP growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates, the latter has been used.
As a result, an estimated growth rate of 2.0% 2015: 2.2% has been used for the flight support and Ontic CGUs, which reflects forecast long-term US GDP growth.
ERO has an estimated long term growth rate of 1% as set out in more detail in the following section on ERO impairment.

The WACC has then been adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.
91 Consolidated Balance The discount rate used was 7.3% 2015: 8.4% for the CGUs within Flight Support and 9.4% to 9.6% 2015: 9.2% to 9.6% for the CGUs within Sheet Aftermarket Services.
92 Consolidated Cash Flow Sensitivity analysis Statement Both the ERO CGUs, Dallas Airmotive DAI and H&S Aviation H S have recognised impairment in 2016, see below.
93 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity In relation to ASIG CGUs the operations were held for sale at 31 December 2016 and subsequently have been sold.
The business assets were 94 Accounting Policies of impaired in 2016 based on the fair market value established in that disposal process, see notes 25 and 27. theGroup In relation to Signature Flight Support and Ontic management has concluded that for these CGUs no reasonably foreseeable change in the 101 Notes to the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
Consolidated Financial Statements ERO impairment 150 Company Balance Sheet Management previously reported that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model could result in an impairment charge for Dallas Airmotive DAI.
151 Company Statement of Changes in Equity The ERO trading conditions remained challenging during the year, with no recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft flying 152 Accounting Policies of visible for the engine platforms on which ERO operates.
This coupled with continued pressure on pricing and workscopes, has led to another theCompany disappointing ERO result.
Engine trading is much reduced and this, together with further margin pressure arising from OEM actions, and reduced demand for lease engines, was only partially offset by the limited cost savings so far delivered through the footprint restructuring 154 Notes to the Company Financial Statements programme and additional cost reduction actions.
As a result of this performance and with no visible recovery in legacy mid-cabin fixed wing and rotorcraft flying, an impairment review was carried out at 30 June 2016 for both the DAI and H S CGUs within the ERO business.
161 Subsidiaries and Related Undertakings Key assumptions used in the ERO impairment test 168 Five Year Summary The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are consistent with the year end goodwill impairment test as set out above, with the exception of discount rates that are set out below.
169 Alternative Performance Measures Despite the level of B&GA growth in flying hours the authorised engine platforms at DAI and H S are no longer projected to experience this 174 Shareholder Information level of growth as DAI and H S do not have engine authorisations for a number of the engine platforms that are now projected to have above average growth.
Cuts to the US military budget continue to negatively impact the flight activity of some platforms and thus maintenance spend.
As a result, the significant improvement in performance included in the ERO forecast period for the purposes of the 31 December 2015 impairment review is no longer expected to be achieved.
For the impairment model used at 31 December 2015, the average annual growth rate in EBITDA across 2016-2020 was 11%.
For the impairment model used at 30 June 2016, the average annual growth rate for the equivalent period is now assumed to be 1.3%.
Beyond the 5 year forecast period, a conservative approach has been used of 1% long-term growth which reflects the declining nature of the existing platforms on which DAI and H S are currently operating and we have assumed that new engine authorisation acquisitions, which would require significant further investment are not secured.
This compares to a long-term growth rate of 2.2% used previously which broadly reflected the GDP growth rate over the long term.
The weaker outlook for the DAI and H S engine platforms relative to the markets as a whole has resulted in the reduction of the long-term growth rate to 1%.
The Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as the foundation for determining the discount rates to be applied.
The WACC was then adjusted to reflect risks specific to the CGU not already reflected in the future cash flows for that CGU.
The discount rate used for the impairment was 10.9% 31 December 2015: 9.5% for the DAI CGU and 10.4% 31 December 2015: 9.2% for the H S CGU.
112 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Impairment recognised Following testing it was concluded that the carrying value of the DAI and H S CGUs exceeded their recoverable values.
Accordingly in the Groups interim report as at 30 June 2016 management recognised an impairment loss for the DAI and H S CGU assets to bring them to their value-in use.
A further impairment review as at 31 December 2016 was undertaken for both the DAI and H S CGU assets as set out above.
The review concluded that there was no material change in the outlook or the discount rate for the CGUs.
The table below summarises the allocation of the impairment loss for each asset class within both CGUs.

All of which are investments within the Flight Support segment.
On 5 February 2016 the Group acquired Landmark Aviation.
Under the terms of the regulatory approval in connection with the acquisition of Landmark Aviation, the Company was required to sell six legacy Landmark Aviation FBOs, see note 25.
Though the operations are wholly owned by the Group, as a result of the restrictions placed upon our influence by the requirements of the U. S. Department of Justice the results of the operations have been accounted for as an associate undertaking.
As part of the acquisition of Landmark Aviation the Group also acquired Landmarks aircraft management and charter business.
The 100% equity holding in this business was classified as an associate on acquisition as a result of operating restrictions imposed on the Groups investment by foreign ownership regulations.
On 30 December 2016 the Group agreed to the merger of its aircraft management and charter business with Gama Aviations US aircraft management business.
The Group now owns a 24.5% equity holding of the merged venture, Gama Aviation Signature Aircraft Management and has classified its investment as an associate.
In 2015 the Groups investment in Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre Limited was reclassified from a financial instrument to an associate to more appropriately reflect our level of influence.
As described in note 2 the reclassification resulted in the recognition of $5.2 million of operating profit during 2015 which related to prior periods.

S. private placement senior loan notes outstanding with $400 million accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating rates.
The remainder is accounted for at amortised cost.
Under IFRS hedge accounting rules the fair value movement on the loan notes is booked to interest and is offset by the fair value movement on the underlying interest rate swaps.
The Group includes the fair value gain on the interest rate swaps in relation to the loan notes within net debt so that the net effect is to show the $500 million US private placement at face value and to reflect the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity.
More information is included in note 17.

These companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims.
The cash balances held by these companies are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents.
As is usual practice for captive insurance companies some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities standby letters of credit that have been provided to certain external insurance companies.
The table below details the contractual amount of the cash balances that have been pledged as collateral for these contingent liabilities, all of which are current: 2016 2015 US dollar Sterling Total US dollar Sterling Total $m $m $m $m $m $m BBA Aviation Insurances Limited 11.3 0.7 12.0 11.4 0.8 12.2 BBA Aviation Insurances Vermont Inc 15.2 15.2 15.1 15.1 Total 26.5 0.7 27.2 26.5 0.8 27.3 124 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The standby letters of credit have been issued via bank facilities and the amount of these facilities corresponds to the amounts pledged as detailed in the table above.
The amounts pledged are usually for less than one year, and are secured by a legal charge to the bank providing the letters of credit, over the cash balances of these companies corresponding to the amount of the standby letters of credit.
Financial risk factors Our activities expose the Group to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall the risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with Group subsidiary companies.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined on page 36.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times based on EBITDA.
The borrowing facilities permit the use of an acquisition spike which allows for the maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA covenant to be 4.0 times for two test periods following the activation of the acquisition spike.
The acquisition spike was activated in February 2016 so the higher test applied for the testing periods ending June 2016 and December 2016.
The maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA will revert back to 3.5 times from the testing period ending June 2017.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well-defined policies for the management of these risks which includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign exchange risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in which the operations are located.
The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the income statement since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets which are principally denominated in US dollars.
As at 31 December 2016, the majority of the Groups net borrowings were denominated in US dollars as set out below: 2016 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 136.8 15.5 22.2 8.0 182.5 Borrowings and finance leases 1,548.2 0.8 0.4 1,549.4 Net borrowings per the Balance Sheet 1,411.4 14.7 21.8 8.0 1,366.9 2015 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 893.9 12.0 50.4 10.1 966.4 Borrowings 513.1 0.1 8.9 1.3 523.4 Net borrowings per the Balance Sheet 380.8 11.9 41.5 8.8 443.0 125 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 89 Consolidated Income Statement 17.

This is $7.3 million 2015: $7.8 million lower than the carrying value, adjusted Income for the deduction of debt issuance costs.
The net carrying value as at 2016 was $507.3 million 2015: $507.8 million.
91 Consolidated Balance Sheet The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange 92 Consolidated Cash Flow policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through Statement the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign 93 Consolidated Statement currency exposures exist then generally a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows are covered, depending on the certainty of of Changes in Equity these cash flows.
94 Accounting Policies of theGroup The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting regular reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange 101 Notes to the transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy.
The preConsolidated Financial Statements determined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary 150 Company Balance Sheet with the Groups relationship banks.

A gain of $4.5 million 2015: gain of $1.1 million has beentransferred to the income statement.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through theBBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to $34.6 million 2015: $5.7 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
Thenetimpact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similarbut opposite effect on administrative expenses.
ii Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings.
The Groups bank debt is funded through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups capital markets borrowings are financed through US private placement fixed rate debt which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy in relation to interest rate risk specifies the portion of its debt obligations, which should be fixed through the use of fixed rate debt and or interest rate swaps, based on the debt maturity profile and an assessment of interest rate trends.

Therefore, as at 31 December 2015 bank loans were $nil but the table above includes $305 million of cash flow interest rate swaps which have been put in place to hedge the bank debt.
The fair values of the financial instruments above are categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis that their fair value has been calculated using inputs that are observable in active markets which are related to the individual asset or liability.
The Group has designated $1,045 million interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of which $150 million are forward starting interest rate swaps and the fair value gain of $5.4 million 2015: gain of $2.6 million has been recognised in other comprehensive income.
A charge of $7.3 million 2015: charge of $3.7 million has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
As detailed in note 16, $400million of the $500million US dollar private placement loan notes included within borrowings above have been adjusted by fair value changes due to interest rate risk, as this has been hedged using interest rate swaps converting fixed interest to floating interest rates.
The fair value loss of $3.8 million on the swaps has been recognised in the income statement 2015: gain of $1.1 million which has been offset by the fair value gain on the related fixed rate debt of $3.8 million 2015: loss of $1.1 million.
This has also been booked to the income statement and the net impact is immaterial.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, aswell as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities, the Group is exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets held by the Group and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.

92 Consolidated Cash Flow Each counterparty that the Group uses for derivatives, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum Statement credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and derivatives that can 93 Consolidated Statement be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
of Changes in Equity 94 Accounting Policies of As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the Group had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These exposures are theGroup continually monitored and reported and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
No significant losses are expected to arise from non-performance by these counterparties.
101 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Commercial-related credit risk Statements The Groups exposure to commercial-related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts 150 Company Balance Sheet presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled by a number ofdifferent ways 151 Company Statement of including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2016 and 2015 respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or balance sheet from changes in interest rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges areassumed to be recorded fully within other comprehensive income: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash andderivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the Income Statement: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rate affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: t he sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances of the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumes this is the position for a full 12-month period: t he sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and t he sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used due to the fact that historically floating US dollar interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.

130 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Insurance provisions relate to the Groups captive insurance Companies.
The Groups captive insurance companies retain a portion of the exposure they insure on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
Currently the Group retains all or a portion of the risk in relation to its Aviation, Workers Compensation, Automobile and Property damage insurances.
Significant delays occur in the notification and or settlement of claims and judgements involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however, it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are estimated to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
The liabilities have an expected life of up to ten years 2015: ten years.
Restructuring provisions represent costs provided in relation to commitments made at the balance sheet date for reorganisations which are expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date.
In 2015 the charges and the closing balance relate to the closure of ASIG Singapore.
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations represent a provision for environmental and other liabilities relating to businesses that have been disposed of by the Group in prior years.
The provision of $11.3 million 2015: $17.3 million is partially offset by expected recoveries from third parties of $5.7 million 2015: $4.8 million, which are included within trade and other receivables dueafter one year $5.0 million, 2015: $4.1 million and trade and other receivables due within one year $0.7million, 2015:$0.7million in note 12.
Theliabilities have an expected life of up to 50 years.
Environmental provisions relate to environmental liabilities within continuing operations of the Group.
Other provisions relate to other trading matters, primarily relating to warranties in the Aftermarket Services division.
Due to acquisitions the balance of other liabilities of this nature now warrants separate disclosure.
As such the liabilities have been transferred from other liabilities and accruals to provisions in the year to better reflect their nature.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was $13.1 million 2015: $12.5 million of which $8.9 million 2015: $8.1 million was in respect of schemes outside of the United Kingdom.
This includes $10.9 million 2015 $9.7 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs and defined benefit obligation are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection Plan IPP, with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the IPP are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
As required by UK pension law, there is a board of Trustees that, together with the Group, is responsible for governance of the IPP.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
Since the initial buy-in, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of new pensioner liabilities, although there have been no new tranches purchased during 2015 or 2016.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan.
The income from the annuity matches the payments to be made to the pensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The Company closed the IPP to future accrual with effect from 31 May 2016 after consultation with members.
On this date, all active members became deferred and their pension increases in future will be linked to deferred revaluations.
The actuarial valuation of the UK Income and Protection Plan the IPP as at 31 March 2015 indicated a funding deficit of 44.5 million $66million at rate as at 31 March 2015.
As agreed with the Trustees of the IPP, BBA will make deficit contribution payments to the IPP of 0.3million per annum in addition to the Asset-Backed Funding payments set out below to meet the costs of running the IPP.
The next actuarial valuation is due as at 31 March 2018.
The US Minimum Funding actuarial valuation for the BBA retirement plan as at 1 January 2016 indicated a funding deficit of $2.3 million.
As required by US law, BBA will make contribution payments that are in excess of the minimum required contribution amounts.
The next actuarial valuation is due as at 1 January 2017.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued 90 Consolidated Statement During the first half of 2014, the Group agreed a new long-term funding package with the Trustee of the IPP, following the sale of APPH of Comprehensive Limited.
As part of this funding package, an Asset-Backed Funding ABF structure was put in place, which entitles the Trustee to receive Income payments of 2.7 million each year until 2034.
In addition, the Group made an additional payment of 4.2 million in January 2015.
91 Consolidated Balance Sheet The ABF structure consists of a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP, formed between two newly incorporated subsidiaries of the Group and the Trustee of the IPP.
The SLP has a long-term inter-company loan receivable due from Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing UK 92 Consolidated Cash Flow Limited Ontic UK, on which annual interest payments of 2.7 million are due over the term of the loan.
The SLP will make quarterly profit Statement distributions of the interest payments received from Ontic UK to the IPP, totalling 2.7 million per annum.
The Trustee of the IPP acquired its 93 Consolidated Statement interest in the SLP via an in-specie contribution from BBA.
of Changes in Equity 94 Accounting Policies of The ABF structure has been established so that the three newly created entities are consolidated into the Groups financial statements.
In theGroup addition, the interest in the SLP held by the IPP is not treated as an asset under IAS19, and therefore is not included as part of the Groups pensions disclosures under IAS19.
Instead, the payments due to the IPP are treated as a series of payments which the Group has committed 101 Notes to the to make Consolidated Financial Statements The split of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2016 is approximately 45% in respect of deferred members and 55% in respect of 150 Company Balance Sheet pensioner members.
The weighted average duration of the IPPs liabilities is approximately 15 years.
151 Company Statement of In February 2016, the Company acquired the Northern Executive Aviation Limited Pension and Assurance Scheme as part of the Landmark Changes in Equity Acquisition.
This Plan has been included in the consolidated accounts within this report with effect from 5 February 2016.
The Groups foreign 152 Accounting Policies of pension schemes all in North America mainly relate to a funded defined benefit pension arrangement.
theCompany There is also a post-retirement medical plan and a deferred compensation plan.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified 154 Notes to the Company Financial Statements actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
161 Subsidiaries and Related In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and Undertakings healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2016.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have 168 Five Year Summary been adopted: 169 Alternative Performance United Kingdom North America Measures 174 Shareholder Information 2016 2015 2016 2015 Per annum % Discount rate 2.5 3.7 4.1 4.3 3.5 Rate of increase to pensionable salaries 3.2 3.0 2.3 2.3 Price inflation Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.1 2.9 2.3 2.3 IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used to discount the liability be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bond investments.
The currency and terms of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the postemployment obligations.
The discount rate for the UK Plans have been derived using a yield curve approach.
The yield curve is based on the yield available on Sterling AA rated corporate bonds of a term similar to the liabilities.
The RPI assumption for the UK Plans allow for the shape of the inflation spot curve and the duration of the Plans liabilities.
A deduction of 30 basis points has been made to the breakeven inflation assumption to allow for an inflation risk premium.
For the UK Plans, the mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan, and a best estimate view of future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the IPP as at 31 December 2016 are as follows: 2016 2015 Male Female Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65-year-old years 22.1 24.3 22.0 24.2 Life expectancy for a 65-year-old in 15 years years 23.5 26.2 23.4 26.1 For the US post-retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 7.50% which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per annum to 5.0% in 2022 onwards.

The value of these annuities has been calculated as being equivalent to the value of the pensioner liabilities which they match, using the same actuarial assumptions used to calculate the corresponding element of the DBO.
The purpose of the annuity is to help reduce asset liability mismatch risk.
The remainder of the assets of the UK Plan are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles, with equities being the next largest asset class held after the insurance contract.
The objective of the remainder of the portfolio is to generate excess returns, in order to partially fund the UK Plan through asset performance.
To the extent that actual investment returns achieved are lower than those assumed, then this may result in a worsening of the funding position and higher future cash contribution requirements for the Group.
This is particularly the case in respect of the proportion of the assets held within equity instruments.
The assets of the US Plans are invested in a range of funds with different risk and return profiles.
The risks inherent in the investment strategy for these Plans is similar to the risks posed by the investment strategy for the UK Plans, albeit they are smaller in magnitude given the size of the US Plans relative to the UK Plans.

These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted at this time.
Included in the unrecognised gross temporary difference is $9.5 million 2015: $8.7 million relating to losses due to expire in 2020 which relates to losses that will expire by 2020.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax legislation.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities could arise but have not been recognised is $13.0 million 2015: $1.5 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
