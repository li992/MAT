STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 22.
Provisions continued The Group has received claims and notifications from patients of a consultant, who previously had practising privileges at Spire Healthcare.
The patients are claiming against the consultant and other involved parties including the Group.
Court hearings are scheduled for a limited number of claims in October 2017 through which precedent will be established regarding how future claims will be treated.
The Group is defending such claims and the legal process is expected to take place over a period of several years.
There is significant uncertainty regarding the number of claims, the outcome of the claims, any amounts to be awarded to each claimant and the apportionment of damages between the parties.
It is, therefore, not possible to reliably estimate any liability of the Group.
The Group maintains comprehensive medical malpractice insurance, and in the event that the Group is found liable, the Directors consider that insurers will meet any such liabilities, subject to certain terms and excess limitations.
Deferred taxation The movement for the year in the net deferred tax liability is as follows: Property, plant and Losses million equipment and other Total At 1 January 2015 91.7 43.9 47.8 Recognised in profit or loss 6.1 17.6 11.5 Change in tax rates 7.8 2.0 5.8 Recognised in equity 0.1 0.1 At 1 January 2016 77.8 24.2 53.6 Recognised in profit or loss 0.3 13.6 13.9 Change in tax rates 5.1 0.1 5.2 Reassessment of property timing differences note 4 8.4 8.4 Disposal of subsidiary company 0.2 0.2 Recognised in equity 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 2016 81.4 10.2 71.2 Disclosed within liabilities 81.4 10.2 71.2 Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has arisen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base.
Of the amounts included in losses and other, 8.5 million 2015: 23.0 million relate to losses.
The losses relate entirely to non-trade losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
The Finance Bill 2016, which includes a further reduction in the UK corporate tax rate from 18.0% to 17.0% on 1 April 2020, has been enacted and so deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate unless the timing difference is expected to reverse sooner than 1 April 2020 in which case the applicable rate of 18.00% to 20.0% has been used.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2016 as follows: million 2016 2015 Trading losses 0.9 1.9 Capital losses 0.1 0.3 Tax basis for future capital disposals 17.9 10.7 18.9 12.9 These amounts are the expected tax value of the gross timing difference at the enacted long-term tax rate of 17% 2016: 18%.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to the timing of future profits that the trading losses could be offset against and whether capital gains will arise against which the capital losses and tax basis for capital disposals could be utilised.
