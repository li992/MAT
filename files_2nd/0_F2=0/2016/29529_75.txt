OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS Accounting policy The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
The Group leases various premises under non-cancellable lease arrangements.
The total payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.
If an operating lease contains a reinstatement clause, a provision will be raised for the best estimate of the expenses to be incurred at the end of the lease to reinstate the property to its original condition.
This cost is amortised over the life of the lease.
