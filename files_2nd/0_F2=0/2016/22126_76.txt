These items are not reective of the in-year performance of the Group.
The tax impact of the above items is a 54.9m credit.
These items are discussed below: Impairment and amortisation of intangible assets: the Group carries on its balance sheet significant balances related to acquired intangible assets.
The amortisation of these assets, and any impairment charges, are reported separately as they distort the in-year trading results and performance of the acquired businesses is assessed through the underlying operational results.
Contingent consideration movements: in accordance with IFRS 3, movements in the fair value of contingent consideration on acquisitions go through the Group income statement.
These are reported separately because performance of the acquired businesses is assessed through the underlying operational results and such a charge credit movement would distort underlying results.
Asset Services settlement provision: these significant litigation costs are historic in nature, being tied to previous acquisitions, comprising 22.9m of provisions for future costs see note 25 less 10.4m of insurance asset recoveries, and are included in non-underlying as they are not reective of the in-year performance of the Groups operational activities.
Restructuring expense: the Group continually assesses the resourcing levels, both at a divisional level and also in relation to the management and delivery of individual contracts.
This results in restructuring actions in the ordinary course of business and any such charges are recorded within the underlying results.
In 2016 the Board announced a major programme, with the restructuring of the Group into 6 new reporting divisions under a Group-wide programme.
The cost of this Group-wide programme 59.4m has been charged to non-underlying, being the element that is above the normal level of restructuring undertaken by the Group.
Impairment of investment loan: the Group has fully impaired an historic investment loan in the year.
The charge is reported separately as such items are not reective of the in-year performance of the Group.
Impairment of contract related assets: as part of its year-end close process, Capita has undertaken a comprehensive review across its major contracts.
Following this review management has taken the decision to impair, at 31 December 2016, a number of historic assets relating to a few specic contracts, which were being amortised over their contract life.
Non-current assets amounting to 58.3m 16.5m property, plant and equipment see note 13: 41.8m capitalised software development intangible assets see note 14 have been written off as a non-underlying charge because it does not reect the contract performance in-year, and is consistent with prior year treatment.
Co-op contract dispute: the impact of the dispute with The Co-operative Bank plc on the financial statements is a charge of 18.4m representing the write off of accrued income relating to the transformation programme of 7.5m to cost of sales: and software licence costs of 4.2m included within other intangibles, see note 14, other costs of 5.8m and a provision for 2017 legal costs of 0.9m to administrative expenses.
This has been included within non-underlying because it is one-off in nature and is due to a contractual dispute rather than service credit penalties.
Impairment of goodwill: the Group carries on its balance sheet significant balances related to acquired goodwill.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, and any impairment charges are reported separately as they distort the in-year trading results and because performance of the acquired businesses is assessed through the underlying operational results.
