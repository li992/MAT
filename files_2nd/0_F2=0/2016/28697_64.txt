Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination, in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it.
Current tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Current tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by a tax authority in possession of all relevant knowledge, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur.
Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at the date of each statement of financial position, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the reversal of the temporary difference canbe controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
