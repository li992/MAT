NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 December 2016 11 EARNINGS PER SHARE Management has chosen to disclose the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA measure of earnings per share which has been provided to give relevant information to investors on the long-term performance of the Groups underlying property investment business.
The EPRA measure excludes items which are non-recurring in nature such as profits net of related tax on sale of investment properties and of other non-current investments, and items which have no impact to earnings over their life, such as the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments and the net movement on revaluation of investment properties, and the related deferred taxation on these items.

The EPRA net assets per share measure highlights the fair value of equity on a long-term basis, and so excludes items which have no impact on the Group in the long term, such as fair value movements of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax on the fair value of investment properties.
The EPRA triple net assets per share measure discloses net assets per share on a true fair value basis: all balance sheet items are included at their fair value in arriving at this measure, including deferred tax, fixed rate loan liabilities and any other balance sheet items not reported at fair value.
