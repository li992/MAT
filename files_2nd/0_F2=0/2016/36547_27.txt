Gross rental income represents the Groups revenue from its tenants and customers.
Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the performance of each sector.
Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets between segments.
As stated in the Financial Review on page 43, management reviews the business principally on a proportionally consolidated basis, except for its interests in premium outlets held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, where the Group has less day-to-day involvement in the financial performance and which have different operational characteristics from the Groups property portfolio.
The segmental analysis has been prepared on the basis that management uses to review the business, rather than on a statutory basis.
Property interests represent the Groups non wholly-owned properties which management proportionally consolidate when reviewing the performance of the business.
For reconciliation purposes the Reported Group figures, being wholly-owned properties, are shown in the following tables.
In October 2015, the Group acquired an interest in a loan portfolio secured on retail properties located in Ireland in a 50:50 joint venture.

DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited, Chartered Surveyors have valued the Groups properties, excluding those held by the Groups premium outlet investments which have been valued by Cushman & Wakefield LLP, Chartered Surveyors.
Valuations have been prepared in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 based on certain assumptions as set out in note 1.
Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
Summaries of the valuers reports are available on the Companys website: www.
In the case of leasehold properties, valuations are net of any obligation to freeholders or superior leaseholders.
To comply with IAS 40 and IAS 17 these obligations and the related leasehold assets are included in the balance sheet within Obligations under finance leases note 21 and Interests in leasehold properties respectively.
Further information is provided in Significant accounting policies on page 138.
As noted in Significant judgements and key estimates on page 136, real estate valuations are complex, derived from data which is not widely publicly available and involve a degree of judgement.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
Inputs to the valuations, some of which are unobservable as defined by IFRS 13, include capitalisation yields nominal equivalent yield and market rental income ERV.
These inputs to the valuations are analysed by segment in the rental and valuation data tables on pages 179 and 182 and the valuation change analysis in the Financial Review on pages 48 and 49.
All other factors remaining constant, an increase in rental income would increase valuations, whilst increases in capitalisation yields and discount rates would result in a fall in values and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase of more than one unobservable input would augment the impact on valuation.
The impact on the valuation would be mitigated by the interrelationship between unobservable inputs moving in opposite directions.
For example, an increase in rents may be offset by an increase in yield, resulting in no net impact on the valuation.
A sensitivity analysis showing the impact on valuations of changes in yields and rental income is shown below.

Capitalised interest is calculated using the cost of secured debt or the Groups average cost of borrowings, as appropriate, and the effective rate applied in 2016 was 3.1% 2015: 3.8%.
At 31 December 2016 the historic cost of investment and development properties was 3,841.9 million 2015: 3,830.0 million.

In October 2015, the Group acquired an interest in a loan portfolio secured on retail properties located in Dublin, Ireland in a 50% joint venture for 690.2 million.
The Irish loan portfolio held by the joint venture consisted primarily of interest-bearing loans which at 31 December 2015 were included within other current assets in note 12A on page 155.
The majority of these loans were converted into property assets in 2016.
It is anticipated that the remaining loans of 54.1 million, which are included within other current assets in note 12A on page 153, will be converted to property assets in 2017.
In 2016, the element of the loan portfolio relating to the Ilac Centre, Dublin Central and the Irish development sites was transferred to the Reported Group prior to conversion to property assets.
These properties are included within asset acquisitions in note 11 on page 150.
The Reported Group has a 50% interest in the Ilac Centre which is held within a joint operation and proportionally consolidated, the other assets are wholly owned by the Reported Group.
Further advances were made by the Reported Group to the Irish joint venture in 2016 to fund the conversion of the loan portfolio relating to Dundrum Town Centre, which is now owned by Dundrum Retail Limited Partnership and Dundrum Car Park Limited Partnership.
In 2016, the Group sold 50% stakes in Grand Central, Birmingham and Westquay Watermark, Southampton for 175 million and 47 million respectively.
The total is shown separately in note 11 on page 150 as a transfer to investment in joint ventures.

The interest rates shown are the weighted average for fixed rate borrowings.
Floating rate borrowings bear interest based on LIBOR, with the exception of certain euro borrowings whose interest costs are linked to EURIBOR.
Financing activities during the year are detailed in the Financial Review on pages 51 and 52.
20: Financial instruments and risk management Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further discussion of Treasury risks is set out in the Risks and Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report on page 57.
The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: A: Debt management The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using shortterm funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which the Group maintains strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
B: Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to manage the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to floating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had interest rate swaps of 250.0 million 2015: 250.0 million, maturing in 2020 under which the Group pays interest at a rate linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of interest rate swaps was an asset of 19.3 million 2015: 13.8 million.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C: Foreign currency management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing euro-denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in euro and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
The Group also hedges the impact of foreign exchange movements in debt raised in foreign currencies through the use of derivatives to swap the cash flows back to either sterling or euro.
COM 161 Notes to the accounts continued 20: Financial instruments and risk management continued C: Foreign currency management continued To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in euro-denominated entities, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro-denominated bonds, senior notes, bank loans and currency swaps, as net investment hedges.
This designation allows exchange differences on hedging instruments to be recognised directly in equity and offset against the exchange differences on net investments in euro-denominated entities also recognised in equity.
The notional and carrying amount of these euro-denominated liabilities is shown below.
The euro notional is the amount due at maturity without netting any receivable of different currency under the same instrument.
The carrying amount is the book value at which euro-denominated financial instruments are recognised within borrowings.
The fair value of euro-denominated bonds at 31 December 2016 was 1,327.8 million 2015: 767.6 million.
D: Profit and loss account and balance sheet management The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on page 51.
E: Cash management and liquidity Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity while maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 20A.
F: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits, balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable, participative loans to associates and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables, restricted monetary assets, cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The credit risk on balances due from joint ventures, other investments, loans receivable and participative loans is limited as they are supported by investment properties held within the joint ventures and associates.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate, as set out in note 15.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in table 98 of the Additional Disclosures on page 181.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The credit risk on restricted monetary assets, being cash held by the Group and its managing agents on behalf of third parties, is similarly considered low.
At 31 December 2016, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 316.4 million 2015: 335.8 million which excludes those balances supported by investment properties.

H: Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings over the longer term.
The tables below provide indicative sensitivity data.

The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the floating rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
