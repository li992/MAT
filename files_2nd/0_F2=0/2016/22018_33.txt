In 2012 13 we had recognised specific item charges of 85m and 58m against revenue and EBITDA respectively relating to this matter.
In 2015 16 we recognised revenue and costs of 203m, being the prior year impacts of ladder pricing agreements with the UK mobile operators following the Supreme Court judgment.
In August 2014 the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT handed down judgment on various appeals brought against a December 2012 Ofcom determination on the pricing of certain Ethernet products.
We disagree with the CATs judgment and have been granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Ofcom had determined that BT had overcharged for certain services between 1 April 2006 and 31March 2011 and required BT to make repayments.
The CAT judged that BT should also pay interest on these amounts.
Together with a review of our regulatory risk position in relation to other historical matters, we recognised a specific item charge of 75m in 2014 15.
Impact of fair value adjustment to deferred revenue on acquisition of EE we recognised a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of EE which reduced the amount of deferred income in relation to its prepaid subscriber base by 70m.
The step down reflects the difference between the amount recorded by EE on acquisition and the fair value calculated based on the incremental cost that a market participant would incur to take on the liability plus a reasonable profit margin.
This amount was released as a reduction to revenue in the period between acquisition and 31 March 2016, reflecting the period over which EE provided the related service.
Acquisition, integration and financing costs relating to EE transaction costs of 99m 2014 15: 19m, 2013 14: nil and integration costs of 17m 2014 15: nil, 2013 14: nil were incurred relating to the acquisition of EE and debt financing fees of 8m 2014 15: 7m, 2013 14: nil were incurred arranging a 3.6bn acquisition facility.
Property rationalisation costs we recognised a 29m charge 2014 15: 45m, 2013 14: nil relating to the rationalisation of the groups property portfolio.
Restructuring charges There were no restructuring charges for the current year.
The components of the restructuring charges recognised in the prior years were: people and property charges of 2014 15: 294m and in 2014 15 2013 14: 217m, principally comprising leaver costs of 2014 15: 237m in 2014 15 and 2013 14: 175m, property exit costs and networks, products and procurement channels rationalisation charges of 2014 15: 21m and in 2014 15 2013 14: 59m.
Profit on disposal of property in February 2015 we disposed of a surplus building in London, Keybridge House, for a consideration of 93m resulting in a profit of 67m.
Interest expense on retirement benefit obligations see note 20 for more details.
Profit or loss on disposal of interest in associates and joint ventures in 2014 15 we recognised a 25m profit on the disposal of an associate, which was held at nil cost.

Balances as at 1 April 2014 are presented on a consistent basis.
b Includes a deferred tax asset of 2m 2014 15: 2m arising on contributions payable to defined contribution pension plans.
The acquisition relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of EE, such as deferred tax liabilities on fair value adjustments note14 and deferred tax assets acquired with the business of EE, such as tax losses.
We have recognised a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2016 of 293m in respect of EE Limiteds historical tax losses.
We expect to be able to utilise these against future taxable profits in EE Limited.
If EE Limiteds business were subject to a major change in the nature or conduct of trade on or before 5 February 2018, these losses would be forfeited and a current tax liability of 152m would be created.
Based on our current plans, we do not expect a major change to arise.
Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to BTs pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.

Taxation continued Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax will change from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017 and to 18% on 1 April 2020.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2016 have been calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit specific item in the income statement note 8 and as a deferred tax expense in reserves.
The UK Finance Bill 2016 includes a reduction of the UK corporation tax rate to 17% on 1 April 2020.
This will replace the 18% UK corporation tax rate that is currently legislated to take effect.
This will have an effect on future tax charges of the group.
Relevant deferred tax balances will be re-measured to 17% once the UK Finance Bill 2016 is substantively enacted.
Unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences At 31 March 2016 the group had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 4.1bn 2014 15: 3.8bn.
The groups other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
Asummary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: At 31 March 2016 m Expiry Restricted losses Europe 13 20172023 Americas 105 20202034 Other 38 20172021 Total restricted losses 156 Unrestricted operating losses 3,742 No expiry Other temporary differences 155 No expiry Total 4,053 At 31 March 2016 the group also had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 17.0bn 2014 15 17.1bn.
These losses have no expiry date, and the group considers the future utilisation of these losses to be remote.
At 31 March 2016 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were 3.3bn 2014 15 8.1bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise.
Tax of 23.1m 2014 15: 21.2m would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.
Options over 15m shares 2014 15: 13m shares, 2013 14: 24m shares were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is antidilutive.

Profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company was 2,581m 2014 15: 2,135m, 2013 14: 2,016m and profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests was 7m 2014 15: nil, 2013 14: 2m.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.
As a result of the acquisition of EE our earnings per share ratio improved despite the 7% increase in the weighted average number of shares.
The group also measures financial performance based on adjusted earnings per share, which excludes specific items.
Adjusted earnings per share and a reconciliation to basic earnings per share is disclosed on page 241.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services, BT Business, BT Consumer and EE, since acquisition on 29 January 2016.
These are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Global Services BT Business BT Consumer EE Total m m m m m At 31 March 2014 1,037 214 80 1,331 Exchange differences 59 6 65 At 31 March 2015 1,096 220 80 1,396 Acquisitions note 14 439 1,103 4,888 6,430 Exchange differences 49 3 52 At 31 March 2016 1,145 662 1,183 4,888 7,878 The amount of goodwill allocated to BT Business and BT Consumer relates to goodwill arising on the acquisition of EE and represents the expected benefit to each of these CGUs from the synergies identified.
Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a three-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows are also adjusted downwards to reflect the different risk attributes of each CGU.
The value in use calculation includes a fourth year estimate which is held flat from the last year assumed in the financial plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows beyond the fourth-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2015 16 was 8.8% 2014 15: 9.3% for all CGUs.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that sector.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The perpetuity growth rate for BTGlobal Services was 2.3% 2014 15: 2.2%, 2.0% 2014 15: 2.0% for BT Business and BTConsumer, and 2.0% for EE.
Sensitivities There is significant headroom in all CGUs.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 6,900m.
Thefollowing changes in combination in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.3% assumption applied to a revised assumption of no growth an increase in the discount rate from the 8.8% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 15% shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 210m or more in perpetuity.
For BT Business, BTConsumer and EE no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
From 1 April 2016, the CGUs that have associated goodwill reflect the reorganisation as disclosed in Note 31.

195 Overview The Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Additional information 14. Business combinations On 29 January 2016 the group acquired the entire share capital of EE Limited EE from Deutsche Telekom and Orange.
The acquisition will enable the group to bring together the UKs best 4G mobile network with the largest superfast fixed network.
The enlarged group will be the UKs leading communications provider which means were best placed to meet the demand we expect for converged products and services.
We did not make any other material acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2016.
Details of the purchase consideration, the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired and provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition of EE are set out below: m Purchase consideration: Cash paid 3,464 Ordinary shares issued 7,507 Total purchase consideration 10,971 BT issued 1,595m of new shares representing 16% of BTs post acquisition issued share capital, as part of the consideration paid for EE.
These were valued at 7,507m based on the published opening share price on 29 January 2016 of 470.7p per share, the day when the shares were admitted to trading.
Of the consideration paid, 80m, being the nominal value, was credited to share capital and 7,424m, net of 3m share issue costs, was credited to a merger reserve.
The transaction qualifies for merger accounting under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.

196 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 14. Business combinations continued Purchase consideration net of cash acquired Of the total 10,971m consideration, 3,464m was satisfied in cash and a reconciliation between this amount and the net cash outflow arising on the acquisition of EE is as follows: m Outflow of cash to acquire subsidiary Cash consideration 3,464 Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired 93 Net outflow of cash investing activities 3,371 Goodwill Goodwill of 6,430m arising from the acquisition is attributable to the revenue synergies expected to be generated from new crossselling and bundling opportunities across the enlarged customer base as well as EEs ability to generate a new subscriber base in the future to replace subscribers churn.
It also includes expected benefits from the existing workforce skills and expertise, and savings on operating costs and capital expenditure as a result of joint efficiencies expected from being part of the enlarged group.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
For the year ended 31 March 2016, goodwill arising on the acquisition has been allocated to the EE, BT Consumer and BT Business CGUs.
BT Consumer and BT Business have been allocated a portion of the goodwill as a result of the benefits that we expect to arise in these CGUs, mainly from synergies.
Note 12 Intangible assets sets out the goodwill allocation for the year ended 31 March 2016 including the outcome of the impairment reviews.
From 1 April 2016, certain businesses within EE will be integrated into the other lines of business as part of the reorganisation disclosed in note 31.
The goodwill relating to EE will therefore be reallocated to other CGUs for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Acquired receivables The fair value of acquired trade receivables was 696m.
The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is 784m of which 88m is expected to be uncollectible.
Revenue and profit contribution From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2016, EE contributed revenues before specific items of 1,038m and EBITDA before specific items of 261m to the group.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2015, the consolidated pro-forma revenue and EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2016 would have been 23,722m and 7,948m respectively.
These amounts have been calculated using EEs consolidated results and adjusting them for differences in accounting policies, and are net of any intercompany transactions with the wider BT group.
Acquisition-related costs included within specific items amounted to 107m in the year 2014 15: 26m.
These mainly comprised advisory and transaction fees, financial advisory costs, stamp duty, legal fees, due diligence, reporting and assurance services.

Retirement benefit plans Background The group has both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme BTPS which is a defined benefit plan that was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
After that date new entrants to BT in the UK have been able to join a defined contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract-based arrangement.
EE operates the EE Pension Scheme EEPS, which has a defined benefit section that was closed to future benefit accrual in 2014 and a defined contribution section which is open to new joiners.
Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension arrangement where the benefits are linked to contributions paid, the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the form in which individuals choose to take their benefits.
Contributions are paid into an independently administered fund.
The income statement charge in respect of defined contribution plans represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a fixed percentage of employees pay.
The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a pension arrangement where participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the plan rules dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay and is not dependent upon actual contributions made by the company or members.
The income statement service cost in respect of defined benefit plans represents the increase in the defined benefit liability arising from pension benefits earned by active members in the current period.
The group is exposed to investment and other experience risks and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions, expected investment income and assets held.

b The actuarial gain or loss arises from changes in the assumptions used to value the defined benefit liabilities at the end of the year compared with the assumptions used at the start of the year.
Thisincludes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and demographic assumptions such as life expectancy.
c The ac tuarial loss or gain arising from experience adjustments on defined benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared with the assumptions made at the start of the year.
Such differences might arise, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement, actual salary increases being different from those assumed or actual benefit increases being different to the pension increase assumption.

Retirement benefit plans continued BTPS At 31 March 2016 there were 301,500 members of the BTPS.
Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the Scheme.
Section A is for members who joined before 1 December 1971, Section B is for members who joined the Scheme between 1December 1971 and 31 March 1986 and Section C is for members who joined the Scheme on or after 1 April 1986 but before the scheme closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001.
The membership is analysed below.

Since 1 April 2009, when changes to member benefits and contribution rates were introduced, Section B and C active members have accrued benefits based upon a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
On a CARE basis benefits are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of inflation or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Benefits earned for pensionable service prior to 1 April 2009 are based upon a members final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
Under the Scheme rules the determination of the rate of inflation for statutory minimum rates of revaluation and indexation for the majority of benefits is based upon either the Retail Prices Index RPI or the Consumer Prices Index CPI which apply to each category of member as shown below.
Active members Deferred members Pensioners a Section B Benefits accrue on a CARE basis increasing Preserved benefits are revalued before Increases in benefits in payment are at the lower of RPI or the individuals actual retirement based uponCPI currently based upon CPI pay increase Section C Increases in benefits in payment are currently based upon RPI up to a maximum of 5% a Section A members have typically elected to take Section B benefits at retirement.
Management of the scheme BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited the Trustee has been appointed by BT as an independent trustee to administer and manage the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the Scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed there are nine Trustee directors, all of whom are appointed by BT.
The chairman of the Trustee is appointed after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions who are also responsible for nominating four directors to act as representatives of the members.
Ofthe remaining four directors, two will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualified candidate, at least one of the Trustee directors is usually a current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS.
Trustee directors are usually appointed for a three-year term but are then eligible for re-appointment.
BTPS assets Asset allocation The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
Theallocations set reflect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
Current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.
The BTPS also uses financial instruments to balance the asset allocation and to manage inflation risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Under IAS19, plan assets must be valued at the bid market value at the balance sheet date.
For the main asset categories securities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices: properties are valued on the basis of open market value: unlisted equities are valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC guidelines: unlisted fixed interest and index-linked instruments are valued using the latest market price or using discounted cash flow models that consider credit risk.

Investment performance The Trustee reports on investment performance against a benchmark which is based on the asset mix and the market returns for each asset class.
BTPS performance against the benchmark for the periods to 30 June 2015 was as follows.
Actual Over Benchmark BTPS return performance Period ending 30 June 2015 % % % 1 year 6.9 8.3 1.4 3 years 7.2 7.8 0.6 10 years 5.6 6.1 0.5 IAS 19 liabilities Valuation methodology The IAS 19 liabilities are measured as the present value of the estimated future benefit cash flows to be paid by each scheme, calculated using the projected unit credit method.
These calculations are performed for the group by professionally qualified independent actuaries.
The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement than assumed.
BTPS liabilities The estimated duration of the BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is around 15 years although the benefits payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 70 years as shown in the graph below.
Whilst benefit payments are expected to increase over the earlier years, the value of the liabilities is expected to reduce.

Retirement benefit plans continued IAS 19 liabilities: Key assumptions The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS under IAS 19 are shown below.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 At 31 March % % % % % % Rate used to discount liabilities 3.30 3.25 4.25 0.44 0.39 0.97 Inflation increase in RPI 2.85 2.85 3.25 b b c b b c Inflation increase in CPI 1.85 1.85 2.50 1.0 1.0 0.75 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.
b Assumed to be 0.2% lower after 31 March 2017. c Assumed to be 0.45% lower after 31 March 2016.
The financial assumptions vary for each plan and the BTPS represents over 97% of the groups retirement benefit obligation.
The nominal financial assumptions weighted by liabilities across all plans are equal to the figures shown in the table above to nearest 0.05%.
Rate used to discount liabilities IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The discount rate at 31March 2016 for the BTPS is based on a market-based AA corporate bond yield curve allowing for the future expected benefit payments.
Inflation increases in RPI and CPI The assumption for RPI has been assessed by reference to yields on long-term fixed and index-linked Government bonds and Bank of England published inflationary expectations.
CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account market forecasts and independent estimates of the expected difference.
Long-term salary increases for BTPS members are assumed to be equal to CPI inflation whilst benefits are assumed to increase by either RPI or CPI inflation as prescribed by the rules of the BTPS and summarised above.
Longevity The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation.
Due to the size of the membership of the BTPS it is considered appropriate for the adopted life expectancy assumptions to take into account the actual membership experience of the Scheme.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience at every triennial valuation.
Under IAS 19, the forecast life expectancies for BTPS members aged 60 are as follows: 2016 2015 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 26.1 26.0 Male in medium pay bracket 27.4 27.3 Male in higher pay bracket 28.8 28.7 Female in lower pay bracket 28.8 28.7 Female in higher pay bracket 29.1 29.0 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.0 1.0 204 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The assumptions on the discount rate, inflation, salary increases and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement of Scheme liabilities.
The table below provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS19 pension liabilities for the BTPS at 31 March 2016, and of the income statement charge for 2016 17, to changes in these assumptions.
The sensitivity of the deficit allows for both the change in the liabilities and the expected change in the assets.
For example, the increase in the deficit under the life expectancy scenario incorporates the expected movement in the value of a contract held to hedge longevity risk.
Decrease increase Decrease Decrease in income increase in increase in statement liability deficit charge bn bn m 0.25 percentage point increase to: a discount rate 1.7 0.8 25 b inflation rate assuming RPI, CPI and salary increases all move by 0.25 percentage points 1.4 0.4 15 CPI inflation rate assuming RPI and salary increases are unchanged 0.9 0.9 35 salary increases assuming RPI and CPI are unchanged 0.2 0.2 10 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 1.3 1.0 35 a Allows for the estimated impact on assets from a 0.25% per year increase to interest rates and corporate bond yields, with credit spreads unchanged.
b Allows for the estimated impact on assets directly linked to inflation from a 0.25% per year increase to inflation.
BTPS funding Triennial funding valuation The triennial valuation is carried out for the Trustee by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
Thepurpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the Scheme has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2014.
The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2017.
The valuation methodology for funding purposes, which is based on prudent assumptions, is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured on an actuarial funding basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The results of the two most recent triennial valuations are shown below.
June June 2014 2011 valuation valuation bn bn BTPS liabilities 47.2 40.8 Market value of BTPS assets 40.2 36.9 Funding deficit 7.0 3.9 Percentage of accrued benefits covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 85.2% 90.4% Percentage of accrued benefits on a solvency basis covered by the BTPS assets at the valuation date 63.0% 66.0% The funding deficit increased to 7.0bn at 30 June 2014.
While deficit contribution payments totalling 2.65bn and investment returns of 5.8% per year since the 2011 valuation contributed to higher assets at the 2014 valuation date, the low interest rate environment resulted in a higher value being placed on the Schemes liabilities which more than offset the improvements in the Schemes assets.
Key assumptions funding valuation These valuations were determined using the following prudent long-term assumptions.
a Nominal rates per year Real rates per year June June June June 2014 2011 2014 2011 valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % Average single equivalent discount rate 4.5 5.2 1.0 2.0 Average long-term increase in RPI 3.5 3.2 Average long-term increase in CPI 2.5 2.2 1.0 1.0 a The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation and is shown as a comparator.
The discount rate at 30 June 2014 was derived from prudent return expectations above a yield curve based on gilt and swap rates.
The discount rate reflects views of future returns at the valuation date.
This gives a prudent discount rate of 2.1% per year above the yield curve initially, trending down to 0.6% per year above the curve in the long-term.
The assumption is equivalent to using a flat discount rate of 4.5% per year.

Future funding obligations and recovery plan Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the group is required to have a funding plan, determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuation, which is a legal agreement between BT and the Trustee and should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
In January 2015, the 2014 triennial funding valuation was finalised, agreed with the Trustee and certified by the Scheme Actuary.
The funding deficit at 30 June 2014 was 7.0bn.
Under the associated recovery plan BT made payments of 875m in March 2015, 625m in April 2015 and 250m in March 2016.
BT is scheduled to make future deficit payments in line with the table below.
Year to 31 March 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Deficit contribution m 250 688 699 711 724 670 670 670 495 495 495 495 495 289 The ordinary contribution rate to meet the benefits of current employed members increased from 13.5% to 16.0% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 1 April 2015 through to the next valuation date.
Other protections The 2014 funding agreement with the Trustee included additional features for BT to provide support to the Scheme.
These include: Feature Detail Shareholder In the event that shareholder distributions exceed an agreed threshold, BT will provide matching payments to the distributions Scheme.
The threshold allows for 15% per year dividend per share growth plus 300m per year of share buybacks on a cumulative basis.
BT will consult with the Trustee if it considers share buybacks in excess of 300m per year or making a special dividend.
These provisions apply from 29 January 2015 until 31 March 2019, or until the finalisation of the next valuation if earlier.
Material In the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals net of acquisitions in any corporate 12-month period ending 30 June, BT will make additional contributions to the Scheme equal to one third of those net events cash proceeds.
BT will consult with the Trustee if: it considers making acquisitions with a total cost of more than 1bn in any 12-month period: or it considers making disposals of more than 1bn: or it considers making a Class 1 transaction acquisition or disposal which will have a material impact on the Scheme: or it becomes aware it is likely to be subject to a takeover offer.
BT will advise the Trustee should there be other material corporate events which would materially impact BTs covenant to the Scheme.
Negative A negative pledge that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the Scheme in excess of a 1.5bn pledge threshold, to cover both British Telecommunications plc and BT Group plc.
This provision applies until the deficit reduces to below 2.0bn at any subsequent funding valuation.
206 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 20.
Retirement benefit plans continued In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections of BTPS members benefits: Feature Detail Crown The Crown Guarantee was granted by the Government when the group was privatised in 1984 and would only come Guarantee into effect upon the insolvency of BT.
The Trustee brought court proceedings to clarify the scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee.
The Court of Appeal judgment on 16 July 2014 established that: the Crown Guarantee covers BTs funding obligation in relation to members of the Scheme who joined postprivatisation as well as those who joined pre-privatisation subject to certain exceptions : the funding obligation to which the Crown Guarantee relates is measured with reference to BTs obligation to pay deficit contributions under the rules of the Scheme.
The Crown Guarantee is not taken into account for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and is an entirely separate matter, only being relevant in the highly unlikely event that BT became insolvent.
Pension The Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the Scheme and pay benefits not covered by the Crown Guarantee to Protection members.
Fund PPF There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and the PPF would not provide exactly the same benefits as those in the Scheme.
Other benefit plans In addition to the BTPS, the group maintains benefit plans around the world with a focus on these being appropriate for the local market and culture.
The EEPS is the largest defined benefit plan sponsored by the group after the BTPS with defined benefit liabilities of around 700m.
The schemes assets are invested across a number of asset classes including UK listed equities and unit trusts 25%, property 16%, alternative assets 35% and fixed income assets 24%.
A funding valuation of the EEPS is being carried out as at 31 December 2015.
The group is currently paying deficit contributions of 20m each year to meet the deficit at the 31 December 2012 valuation of 130m.
The EEPS also has a defined contribution section with around 12,500 active members.
The BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS is the largest defined contribution scheme maintained by the group with around 29,500 active members.
In the year to 31 March 2016, the group contributed 114m to the BTRSS.

Share-based payments Overview The company has savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and a stock purchase plan for employees in the US.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share-based payment plans are equity-settled.
Details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Incentive Share Plan ISP Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
For ISP awards granted in 2015 16, 2014 15 and 2013 14: 40% of each award is linked to a total shareholder return TSR target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period: 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative free cash flow measure, and 20% to growth in underlying revenue excluding transit.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
Under the terms of the ISP and DBP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested incompany shares for the potential benefit of the participants.

Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BTs historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the DBP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date.
The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2015 16 was 451p 2014 15: 393p, 2013 14: 315p.

Loans and other borrowings Capital management policy The objective of the groups capital management policy is to reduce net debt over time whilst investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and paying progressive dividends.
In order to meet this objective, the group may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group.
The Board regularly reviews the capital structure.
No changes were made to these objectives and processes during 2015 16 and 2014 15.
For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.
The groups capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders equity.
The analysis below summarises the components which the group manages as capital.
211 Overview The Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Additional information 25.
Loans and other borrowings continued Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loansand other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings currentand non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from the most directly comparable IFRS measure to net debt is given below.
On the acquisition of EE, we acquired a further 2,107m of net debt.
b Designated in a fair value hedge relationship in 2014 15, fide-designated in 2015 16. c The in terest rate payable on this bond attracts an additional 0.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating by either Moodys or S&P to the groups senior unsecured debt below A3 A respectively.
In addition, if Moodys or S&P subsequently increase the ratings then the interest rate will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency.
In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum rate reflected in the above table.
212 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 25.
Loans and other borrowings continued Unless previously designated in a fair value hedge relationship, all loans and other borrowings are carried in the group balance sheet and the table above at amortised cost.
The fair value of listed bonds and other long-term borrowings is 14,500m 2014 15: 10,919m and the fair value of finance leases is 290m 2014 15: 273m.
The fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, based on the same or similar issues where they exist.
Where the same or similar issues do not exist, the fair value is estimated based on the calculation of future cash flows using blended discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reflect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
Loans and other borrowings are analysed as follows: 2016 2015 At 31 March m m Current liabilities Listed bonds 2,013 1,422 Finance leases 8 13 Syndicated loan facilities 619 Other loans and bank overdrafts 597 465 Total current liabilities 3,237 1,900 Non-current liabilities Listed bonds 10,444 7,642 Finance leases 232 225 Bank loans 354 Other loans and borrowings 2 1 Total non-current liabilities 11,032 7,868 Total 14,269 9,768 The carrying values disclosed in the above table reflect balances at amortised cost adjusted for accrued interest and fair value adjustments to the relevant loans or borrowings.

Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidityrisk.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as the groups exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk profile between 31 March 2016 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy Interest rate risk arises primarily from the groups long-term borrowings.
Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rate, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.
The groups policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt is at fixed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the Group Finance Director, Director of Treasury and Risk Management or the BT Group Treasurer who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate profile, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to fixed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inflows and net outflows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the Group Finance Director, Director of Treasury and Risk Management or the BT Group Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the Board.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency, capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.

Sensitivity analysis The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: for interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies: and for foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the groups annual net finance expense was insignificant in both 2015 16 and 2014 15.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates is as detailed below: 2016 2015 m m Increase Increase At 31 March reduce reduce Sterling interest rates 626 428 US Dollar interest rates 374 400 Euro interest rates 263 34 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
The groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, and within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures was insignificant in both 2015 16 and 2014 15. Credit ratings The groups December 2030 bond contains covenants which have required the group to pay higher rates of interest once the group ceased to be rated at least A3 in the case of Moodys or at least A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 1.9bn at 31 March 2016, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 9m a year if the groups credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups credit ratings were as detailed below: 2016 2015 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Standard & Poors BBB Positive BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 Positive Baa2 Positive Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short-, mediumand long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Refinancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise.
The maturity profile of the groups loans and borrowings at 31 March 2016 is disclosed in note 25.
The group has term debt maturities of 1.9bn in 2016 17.
216 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 27.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by theBoard.
The group holds cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2016 the group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2014 15: 1.5bn maturing in September 2020 with the option to renew to September 2021.

Credit risk management Management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the Boards defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moodys and S&P and by defining the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
Action is taken, where appropriate and cost effective if counterparties, in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Operational management policy The groups credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, the group may endeavour to minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2016 2015 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 1,639 1,329 Investments 23 2,964 3,567 a Trade and other receivables 17 2,947 2,264 Cash and cash equivalents 24 497 434 8,047 7,594 a The carrying amount excludes 233m 2014 15: 184m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 1,116m 2014 15: 876m of prepayments and other receivables.

The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 17, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, the group has entered into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
The group has also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional 1,882m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash inflow during the year was 79m 2014 15: cash inflow of 297m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within current asset investments and loans and other borrowings, respectively.

The fair value of the energy derivative at 31 March 2016 was nil.
It has been valued using assumptions on volumes, inflation and energy prices.
Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euroand US Dollardenominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to the groups 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect the groups income statement as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings seenote 25.
Forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies are hedged 12 months forward, with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows are recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were effective in the period.
See note 28 for details of the movements in the cash flow hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges In 2014 15 fair value hedges consisted of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the 2028 Sterling bond due to movements in market interest rates.
These were fide-designated on 1 April 2015.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 26.
Other derivatives The groups policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings Total Cost m At 1 April 2014 10,616 Additions 70 At 31 March 2015 10,686 Additions 11,029 Disposals 10,971 At 31 March 2016 10,744 On 29 January 2016, the company acquired the entire share capital of EE Limited EE from T-Mobile Holdings Ltd, which is owned by Deutsche Telekom A. G. DT, and Orange Telecommunications Group Ltd Orange, in exchange for the issue of 1,595m Consideration Shares and 3,464m cash.
The value of the Consideration Shares and cash allotted to DT and Orange at completion was 10,971m.
Subsequently on 29 January 2016 the company sold its entire investment in EE to its wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc at fair value in exchange for an intercompany loan.
Also included within additions is 58m 2014 15: 70m capital contribution in respect of share-based payments.
The company held a 100% investment in BT Group Investments Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, throughout 2015 16 and 2014 15.
Merger reserve On 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.7p per share resulting in a total of 80m being credited to Share capital.
These shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE, which completed on 29 January 2016 note 1 above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a result of this transaction, a merger reserve was created of 7,424m, net of 3m issue costs.
The acquisition of EE was structured by way of a share-for-share exchange and cash.
This transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued.
The company chose to record its investment in EE at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable ie equal to the difference between the fair value of EE and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealised on the basis that it was represented by the investment in EE which is not considered to be qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 10 Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of EE, the company transferred its investment in EE to its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent the loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realised.
Hence the merger reserve is an unrealised profit until it is realised by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
