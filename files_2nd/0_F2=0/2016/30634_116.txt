The Board is responsible for the Groups capital management including the approval of dividends.
This includes an assessment of both the level of reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any proposed distribution.
As Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company.
The major factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include: a the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant entities: a the location of these entities in the Groups corporate structure: a profit and cash flow generation in those entities: and a the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution.
The Groups consolidated reserves set out on page 89 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group.
Equity dividends Accounting policies Dividends paid and received are included in the Company financial statements in the period in which the related dividends are actually paid or received or, in respect of the Companys final dividend for the year, approved by shareholders.
