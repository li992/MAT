STRUCTURED ENTITIES Accounting policy A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.
Contractual arrangements determine the rights and therefore relevant activities of the Structured entity.
Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their activities.
Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entity indicates the Group has power over the contractual relevant activities of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.
In determining whether to consolidate a structured entity the Group takes into account its ability to direct the relevant activities of the structured entity.
Control over relevant activities is generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liquidate the structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securities issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds specific subordinated securities that embody certain controlling rights.
The Group may further consider relevant activities embedded within contractual arrangements such as call options which give the practical ability to direct the entity, special relationships between the structured entity and investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.
Significant accounting judgements Significant judgement is required in determining control over Structured entities.
The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a determination of what the relevant activities are of the entity and who directs these.
Further judgements are made around which investor is exposed to, and absorbs the variable returns of the Structured entity.
The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether the Group, or another involved party is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.
Judgement is further required in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities, specifically if market conditions have an effect on the variable return exposure of different investors.
The Group has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, which may be established by the Group as a sponsor or by a third party, as detailed on the page opposite.

The amortisation charge for the year is recognised in the income statement within note 3 Interests in unconsolidated structured entities: unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that are not controlled by theGroup.
The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities.
An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability of the returns of the Group arising from the performance of the structured entity.
The table below presents the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements relating to variable interests heldin unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entities.
Maximum exposure to loss is primarily limited to the carrying amount of the Groups on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity.
For derivatives, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount.
For commitments and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.
