Stamp duty of 2.5m payable on acquiring Skyepharmas share capital is presented as a deduction against equity as these costs were directly attributable and unavoidable in the context of the share-for-share exchange.
Refer to note 13 Business combinations of the consolidated financial statements.
As 100% of the Skyepharma share capital was acquired through a share transaction, merger relief under the UK Companies Act 2006 is available to allow recognition of a merger reserve as opposed to non-distributable share premium.
The merger reserves are non-distributable reserves that become distributable to offset any future diminution in the investment value or where that investment is disposed of for qualifying consideration.
The accompanying notes form an integral part of these individual financial statements prepared under FRS 101 The Reduced DisclosureFramework.
