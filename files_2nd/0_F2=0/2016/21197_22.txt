Finance costs The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately comprise: for each principal long-term business unit.
2016 2015 The expected return on investments for both policyholders and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions m m applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected investment return assumptions are derived Interest expense on core structural borrowings actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year.
The same margins are applied on Subordinated debt 387 335 Long term senior debt 1 14 a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties.
Commercial paper 1 Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases 388 350 during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and Interest expense on operational borrowings Amounts owed to financial institutions 39 48 changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating Securitised mortgage loan notes at fair value 84 84 experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
123 132 The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit but included in profit before tax.
Interest on collateral received 10 13 Net finance charge on pension schemes note 48 b i 29 25 The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on Unwind of discount on GI reserves 2 2 investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
Extinguishment of debt 13 The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic Other similar charges 74 83 assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked Total finance costs 626 618 and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The profit impact of economic volatility on other long-term business depends on the degree of matching of assets and 8 Long-term business economic volatility liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
The long-term nature of much of the Groups operations means that, for managements decision-making and internal performance d Assumptions management, the effects of short-term economic volatility are treated as non-operating items.
The Group focuses instead on an The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business, as described economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: a Definitions Equities Properties Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and 2016 2015 2016 2015 policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
% % % % Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, United Kingdom 5.5 5.4 4.0 3.9 and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions, where not treated as other items.
Changes due to economic items, such Eurozone 4.5 4.3 3.0 2.8 as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
The expected return on equities and properties has been calculated by reference to the 10 year mid-price swap rate for an AArated bank in the relevant currency plus a risk premium.
The use of risk premium reflects managements long-term expectations of b Economic volatility asset return in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes.
The asset risk premiums are set out in the table The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: below: 2016 2015 2016 2015 Life business m m % % All territories Investment variances and economic assumptions 379 14 Equity risk premium 3.5 3.5 Property risk premium 2.0 2.0 Investment variances and economic assumption changes were 379 million positive 2015: 14 million positive.
Positive variances in the UK reflect lower interest rates and narrowing credit spreads, which increase asset values more than liabilities.
In the first half The 10 year mid-price swap rates as at the start of the period are set out in the table below: of 2016 the Group revised its expectation of future property prices and rental income in light of the UK referendum vote for the 2016 2015 UK to leave the European Union.
The adverse impact of this adjustment on the Groups equity release and commercial mortgage % % Territories portfolios has been broadly offset in the second half of the year as expectations for future property price and rental growth have United Kingdom 2.0 1.9 increased.
In addition, in the UK the investment variance reflects the refined approach of assuming best estimate expected credit Eurozone 1.0 0.8 defaults on corporate bonds with a resulting increase in operating profit in the period.
The positive variance in the UK has been partially offset by negative variances in France and Italy.
The negative variance in France reflects losses on equity hedges managed For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average on an economic basis rather than an IFRS basis and falling interest rates, while the negative variance in Italy reflects widening credit prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risks assessed on a best estimate basis : this includes an spreads.

The positive variance in France reflected realised bond gains and equity outperformance, while the positive variance in Asia was driven by increased interest rates in Singapore, which reduced liabilities by more than asset values.
The negative variance in Italy was driven by widening credit spreads.
The investment variance was largely neutral in the UK, reflecting the positive variance from a reduction in equity release asset default provisions following favourable property market performance, offset by the negative impact of widening credit spreads.

g The economic assumption changes arise as a result of a decrease in the real interest rates used to discount claim reserves for The adverse movement in short-term fluctuations during 2016 compared to 2015 is mainly due to foreign exchange losses on periodic payment orders and latent claims.

reduced and the estimated future inflation rate used to value periodic payment orders has been increased to be consistent with market expectations.
This has, in part, been offset by a change in estimate for the interest rate used to discount periodic payment orders to allow for the illiquid nature of these liabilities.
As explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 40.

The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i. e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are investment properties, certain private equity investments and private placements.

claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.

These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
b Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities and structured settlements The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities and structured settlements are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
The discount rates applied to structured settlements have been increased during 2016 in order to allow for the illiquid nature of these liabilities.
At 31 December 2016, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 220 million 2015: 60 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact has increased during 2016 due to an increase in reserves for bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements as a result of an increase in the estimated future inflation rate used to value these liabilities to be consistent with market expectations.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 56. c Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.
Subsequent event Lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables and discount rate.
The Ogden discount rate is set by the Lord Chancellor in accordance with the Damages Act 1996 and is applied when calculating the present value of future care costs and loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes.
On 27 February 2017 the Lord Chancellor announced a reduction in the discount rate used in the Ogden tables from 2.5% set in 2001 to minus 0.75%.
The reduction in the Ogden discount rate will increase lump sum payments to UK bodily injury claimants.
As a result, claim reserves in the UK have been strengthened by 475 million to allow for the impact of the reduction in the current discount rate.
The Lord Chancellor has also announced that the framework for setting the discount rate is under review and a public consultation will be launched before the end of April 2017.
The timing of the conclusion of this review and its outcome and impact on future Ogden discount rates is unclear.

Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in and reinvestment risk provisions, where a decrease in the valuation interest rate, in response to decreasing risk-free rates and assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 44, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and narrowing credit spreads, has increased liabilities.

9,349 8,811 1 A review of the 2015 movement in unallocated divisible surplus identified inconsistencies in the presentational approach taken for each participating fund across the Group.
As a result, the 2015 analysis has been restated to present iii The movement in the net deferred tax liability was as follows: the movement in participating fund assets and liabilities consistently on a gross basis for all funds.

All schemes are closed to future accrual.
Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with additional future accrual for active members.
i UK schemes In the UK, the Group operates three main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS, the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011 and the Friends Provident Pension Scheme FPPS which was acquired as part of the Friends Life acquisition in 2015.
As the defined benefit section of the UK schemes is now closed to both new members and future accrual, existing deferred members in active service and new entrants participate in the defined contribution section of the ASPS.
The UK schemes operate within the UK pensions regulatory framework.

4 To calculate scheme liabilities in the UK, a single discount rate is used in ASPS RAC, whereas in FPPS, separate discount rates are used for the defined benefit obligation for pensioners and deferred.
2 As at 31 December 2016, the FPPSs cash and other balances includes an insurance policy of 633 million 2015: 546 million issued by a Group company that is not transferable under IAS 19 and is consequently eliminated from the Groups IAS 19 scheme assets.
The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.

They may also affect the performance of the products we deliver to our customers and Cash equivalents 33,914 29,180 the service to our customers and distributors, which can be categorised as risks to our brand and reputation or as conduct risk.

The business chief executive officers and chief risk officers, on a semi-annual basis during 2016, sign-off compliance with these policies and standards, providing assurance to the relevant oversight committees that there is a consistent framework for managing our business and the associated risks.
Cash and cash equivalents reconciles to the statement of financial position as follows: A regular top-down key risk identification and assessment process is carried out by the risk function.
This includes the 2016 2015 consideration of emerging risks and is supported by deeper thematic reviews.
This process is replicated at the business unit level.
m m The risk assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.

For those risk types managed through the holding of capital, being our principal risk types except for liquidity risk, we measure and monitor our risk profile on the basis of the Solvency II solvency capital requirement SCR.
Roles and responsibilities for risk management in Aviva are based around the three lines of defence model where ownership for risk is taken at all levels in the Group.
Line management in the business is accountable for risk management, including the implementation of the risk management framework and embedding of the risk culture.
The risk function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge of the IMMMR process and for developing the risk management framework.
Internal Audit provides an independent assessment of the risk framework and internal control processes.
Board oversight of risk and risk management across the Group is maintained on a regular basis through its Risk Committee and Governance Committee.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take.
Risk appetites are set relative to capital and liquidity at Group and in the business units.
Economic capital risk appetites are also set for each risk type, calculated on the basis of the Solvency II solvency capital requirement SCR.
The Groups position against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the Board on a regular basis.
Long-term sustainability depends upon the protection of franchise value and good customer relationships.
As such, Aviva has a risk preference that we will not accept risks that materially impair the reputation of the Group and requires that customers are always treated with integrity.
The oversight of risk and risk management at the Group level is supported by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO, which focuses on business and financial risks, and the Operational Risk Committee ORC which focuses on operational and reputational risks.
Similar committee structures with equivalent terms of reference exist in the business units.
The risk management framework of a small number of our joint ventures and strategic equity holdings differs from the Aviva framework outlined in this note.
We work with these entities to understand how their risks are managed and to align them, where possible, with Avivas framework.
Further information on the types and management of specific risk types is given in sections b to j below.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to Aviva, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks.
Credit risk is an area where we can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders.
In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, due to the better expected risk adjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.
Our approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements.
Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security investments, structured asset investments, bank deposits, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk at business unit and Group level.
All business units are required to implement credit risk management processes including limits frameworks, operate specific risk management committees, and ensure detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria.
At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate a Group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.
A detailed breakdown of the Groups current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.

Other product lines of the Group, such as protection, are not significantly sensitive to interest rate or market movements.
For c Market risk unit-linked business, the shareholder margins emerging are typically a mixture of annual management fees and risk expense Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact resulting, directly or indirectly from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency charges.
Risk and expense margins will be largely unaffected by low interest rates.
Annual management fees may increase in the exchange rates, equity and property prices.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and short term as the move towards low interest rates increases the value of unit funds.
However, in the medium term, unit funds will the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the grow at a lower rate which will reduce fund charges.
For the UK annuities business interest rate exposure is mitigated by closely value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
We actively seek some market risks as part of our investment and matching the duration of liabilities with assets of the same duration.
However, we have limited appetite for interest rate risk as we do not believe it is adequately rewarded.
The UK participating business includes contracts with features such as guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity The management of market risk is undertaken at business unit and at Group level.
Businesses manage market risks locally using options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
These liabilities are managed through duration matching of assets and the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Group Capital is responsible for monitoring and liabilities and the use of derivatives, including swaptions.
As a result, the Groups exposure to sustained low interest rates on this managing market risk at Group level and has established criteria for matching assets and liabilities to limit the impact of portfolio is not material.
The Groups key exposure to low interest rates arises through its other participating contracts, principally mismatches due to market movements.
Some of these contracts also include features such as guaranteed minimum bonuses, guaranteed investment In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the returns and guaranteed surrender values.
In a low interest rate environment there is a risk that the yield on assets might not be majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing sufficient to cover these obligations.
For certain of its participating contracts the Group is able to amend guaranteed crediting literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its rates.
Our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by competition, bonus mechanisms and contractual arrangements.

iii Interest rate risk Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section j risk and capital management below.
Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities.
A number of policyholder product features have an influence on the Groups iv Inflation risk interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender Inflation risk arises primarily from the Groups exposure to general insurance claims inflation, to inflation linked benefits within the defined benefit staff pension schemes and within the UK annuity portfolio and to expense inflation.

Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, economic capital modelling, expectations are closely linked to long-term interest rates and so are frequently considered with interest rate risk.
Exposure to inflation risk is monitored through economic capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.

typically manages inflation risk through its investment strategy and, in particular, by investing in inflation linked securities and through a variety of derivative instruments, including inflation linked swaps.
The Group typically manages interest rate risk by investing in fixed interest securities which closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities where such investments are available.
In particular, a key objective is to at least match the duration of our annuity v Currency risk liabilities with assets of the same duration, and in some cases where appropriate cash flow matching has been used.
