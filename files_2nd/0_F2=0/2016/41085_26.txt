Capitalised interest is included at a rate of capitalisation of 4.8% 2015: 5.2%.
The total amount of capitalised interest included in investment properties is 6.7m 2015: 5.8m.
The change in fair value of investment properties is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Details of acquisitions and disposals during the year are provided on page 58.
Investment properties include buildings under finance leases of which the carrying amount is 7.1m 2015: 7.1m.
Investment property finance lease commitment details are shown in note 16 h. Valuation The Groups investment properties are held at fair value and were revalued at 31March 2016 by the external valuer, CBRE Limited, a rm of independent qualied valuers in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation Professional Standards 2014.
All the properties are revalued at period end regardless of the date of acquisition.
This includes a physical inspection of all properties, at least once a year.
In line with IFRS 13, all investment properties are valued on the basis of their highest and best use.
For like-for-like properties their current use equates to the highest and best use.
For properties undergoing refurbishment or redevelopment, most of these are currently being used for business accommodation in their current state.
However, the valuation is based on the current valuation at the balance sheet date including the impact of the potential refurbishment and redevelopment as this represents the highest and best use.
The Executive Committee and the Board both conduct a detailed review of each property valuation to ensure appropriate assumptions have been applied.
Meetings are held with the valuers to review and challenge the valuations, ensuring they have considered all relevant information, and rigorous reviews are performed to ensure valuations are sensible.
The valuation of like-for-like properties which are not subject to refurbishment or redevelopment is based on the income capitalisation method which applies market-based yields to the Estimated Rental Values ERVs of each of the properties.
Yields are based on current market expectations depending on the location and use of the property.
ERVs are based on estimated rental potential considering current rental streams, market comparatives, occupancy and timing of rent reviews.
Whilst there is market evidence for these inputs and recent transaction prices for similar properties, there is still a significant element of estimation and judgement.
As a result of adjustments made to market observable data, the significant inputs are deemed unobservable under IFRS13.
When valuing properties being refurbished by Workspace, the residual value method is used.
The completed value of the refurbishment is determined as for like-for-like properties above.
Capital expenditure required to complete the building is then deducted and a discount factor is applied to reect the time period to complete construction and allowance made for construction and market risk to arrive at the residual value of the property.
The discount factor used is the property yield that is also applied to the estimated rental value to determine the value of the completed building.
Other risks such as unexpected time delays relating to planned capital expenditure are assessed on a project-by-project basis, looking at market comparable data where possible and the complexity of the proposed scheme.
"145""Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements continued 10."
Investment properties continued Redevelopment properties are also valued using the residual value method.
The completed proposed redevelopment which would be undertaken by a residential developer is valued based on the market value for similar sites and then adjusted for costs to complete, developers profit margin and a time discount factor.
Allowance is also made for planning and construction risk depending on the stage of the redevelopment.
If a contract is agreed for the sale redevelopment of the site, the property is valued based on agreed consideration.
For all methods the valuers are provided with information on tenure, letting, town planning and the repair of the buildings and sites.
An increase decrease to ERVs will increase decrease valuations respectively, while an increase decrease to yields will decrease increase valuations respectively.
There are interrelationships between these inputs as they are partially determined by market conditions.
An increase decrease in costs to complete and the discount factor will decrease increase valuations respectively.
The reconciliation of the valuation report total to the amount shown in the Consolidated balance sheet as non-current assets, investment properties, is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Total per CBRE valuation report 1,778.6 1,423.4 Deferred consideration on sale of property 36.3 21.3 Assets held for sale 0.3 Head leases treated as finance leases under IAS 17 7.1 7.1 Total investment properties per balance sheet 1,749.4 1,408.9 The Groups Investment properties are carried at fair value and under IFRS 13 are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted.
The different valuation methods are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
As noted in the significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates section, property valuations are complex and involve data which is not publicly available and involves a degree of judgement.
All the investment properties are classied as Level 3, due to the fact that one or more significant inputs to the valuation are not based on observable market data.
If the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes then there could be a transfer between Levels 2 and 3 of classication.
No changes requiring a transfer have occurred during the current or previous year.

Investment in joint ventures continued BlackRock Workspace Property Trust is a Jersey property unit trust established in February 2011 whose aim was to build a fund of up to 100m of office and industrial property in and around London.
The Group holds a 20.1% interest however strategic decisions are taken with the agreement of both parties and no one party has control on their own.
The Group is also property manager with significant delegated powers including responsibility for asset management and recommending acquisitions and disposals.
As a result there is shared control and so the joint venture has been equity accounted in the Consolidated financial statements.
Enterprise House Investments LLP was established to obtain mixed-use planning consent and redevelop Enterprise House, Hayes for new residential and commercial space.
The Group sold its share in this joint venture in July 2015.

Financial risk management objectives and policy The Group has identied exposure to the following financial risks: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk Capital risk management.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will affect the Groups interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both xed and oating rates of interest and then uses interest rate and cross currency swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk prole.
The Group has entered into a cross currency swap to ensure the US Dollar liability streams generated from the US Dollar private placement notes are fully hedged into Sterling for the life of the transaction.
At 31March 2016 69% 2015: 97% of Group borrowings were xed or xed through the use of interest rate and cross currency swaps.
All transactions entered into are approved by the Board and are in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
The Board also monitors variances on interest rates to budget and forecast rates to ensure that the risk relating to interest rates is being sufficiently safeguarded against.
Based upon year end variable rate loan balances, a reasonably possible interest rate movement of -0.5% would have increased and decreased net interest payable and equity respectively by 0.5m 2015: 0.1m.
b Credit risk The Groups main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or a counterparty to a financial instrument, fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to this risk principally relates to the receivables from tenants, deferred consideration on the sale of investment property and cash and cash equivalent balances held with counterparties.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in relation to receivables from tenants is inuenced mainly by the characteristics of individual tenants occupying its rental properties.
The Group has around 4,000 tenants over approximately 70 properties.
The largest 10 single tenants generate less than 6% 2015: 7% of net rent roll.
As such, the credit risk attributable to individual tenants is low.
The Groups credit risk in relation to tenants is further managed by requiring that tenants provide a deposit equivalent to three months rent on inception of lease as security against default.
Total tenant deposits held are 19.3m 2015: 15.6m.
The Group monitors aged debt balances and any potential bad debts every week, the information being reported to the Executive Committee every month as part of the performance monitoring process.
The Groups debtor recovery is consistently high and as such is deemed a low risk area.
Deferred consideration cash and overage on the sale of investment properties is contractual and valued regularly by the external valuer based on current and future market factors.
Cash and cash equivalents and financial derivatives are held with major UK high street banks or building societies and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
"The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2016 2015 m m Cash and cash equivalents note 14 27.8 42.6 Trade receivables current note 13 3.0 2.4 Deferred consideration current note 13 29.3 14.1 Deferred consideration non current note 13 7.0 8.7 67.1 67.8 154""Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Overview Strategic Report Our Governance Financial Statements Additional Information c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due."
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it will always have sufficient funds to meet obligations as they fall due.
This is performed via a variety of methods including daily cash ow review and forecasting, monthly monitoring of the maturity prole of debt and the regular revision of borrowing facilities in relation to the Groups requirements and strategy.
To ensure it can effectively manage its liquidity risk, the Group has an overdraft facility of 4m and a revolving loan facility of 150m 2015: 100m.

Non-controlling interests In December 2009 Workspace acquired full control of its former Workspace Glebe joint venture.
The purchase was satisfied by a cash payment of 15m and a debt facility of 68m provided by the former lenders to the joint venture, with further amounts potentially payable under the Glebe Proceeds Share Agreement GPSA.
The GPSA provided for the former lenders to Workspace Glebe to share in net cash proceeds from disposals from the Glebe property portfolio once Workspace received its priority return.
For proceeds up to 170m the lenders share after deducting Workspaces priority return was 50%, from 170m up to 200m it was 30% and nil thereafter.
The maximum payable under the GPSA was capped at 48m.
All disposals were at the option of Workspace and there were no time limits.

Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share schemes: I Long term equity incentive plan LTIP The LTIP scheme is a performance award scheme whereby shares are issued against three Group performance measures which are assessed over the three-year vesting period.
These are: Absolute TSR Relative TSR Relative NAV.
The shares are issued at nil consideration provided the performance conditions are met.
Under the 2015 LTIP scheme 402,421 performance and matching shares were awarded in June 2015 to Directors and Senior Management 2014 LTIP scheme: 597,967.
Details of the movements for the LTIP scheme during the year were as follows: LTIP Number At 31March 2014 2,655,889 Granted 597,967 Exercised 762,587 Lapsed 1,656 At 31March 2015 2,489,613 Granted 402,421 Exercised 1,141,871 Lapsed 27,348 At 31March 2016 1,722,815 The average closing share price at the date of exercise of shares exercised during the year was 8.85 2015: 6.00.
A Binomial model was used to determine the fair value of the LTIP grant for the Absolute TSR and Relative TSR elements of the LTIP scheme.
"158""Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Overview Strategic Report Our Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2016 2015 Share price at grant 914p 570p Exercise price Nil Nil Average expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 1% 1% Expected dividend yield 2% 2% Average share price volatility 25% 29% Fair value per option Absolute TSR element 305p 221p Fair value per option Relative TSR element 306p 211p The relative NAV is a non-market based condition and the intrinsic value is therefore the share price at date of grant of 914pence."
At each balance sheet date, the Directors assess the likelihood of meeting the conditions under this element of the scheme.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The assessment at year end was that up to 50% of the relative NAV element will vest.
The expected Workspace share price volatility was determined by taking account of the daily share price movement over a three-year period.
The respective FTSE 250 Real Estate share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the same period.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions and historical experience.
The risk free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.
The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the present value of expected future dividend payments to expiry.
II Employee share option schemes The Group operates a Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme and an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS for which there have been no grants since 2008.
Grants under ESOS were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Grants under the SAYE scheme are normally exercisable after three or five years saving.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the SAYE schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Details of the movements for the ESOS and SAYE schemes during the year were as follows: ESOS SAYE Weighted Weighted exercise exercise Options outstanding Number price Number price At 31March 2014 32,565 16.12 340,587 2.06 Options granted 126,060 4.59 Options exercised 100,879 1.39 Options lapsed 14,624 13.16 11,262 3.89 At 31March 2015 17,941 18.53 354,506 3.09 Options granted 86,251 7.27 Options exercised 155,081 1.93 Options lapsed 17,941 18.53 17,983 5.33 At 31March 2016 267,693 4.95 The exercise of all options, other than those obtained under the Groups SAYE scheme, was dependent upon the Group achieving specified performance targets.
