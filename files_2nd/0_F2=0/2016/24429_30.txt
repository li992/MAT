FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 1 Accounting policies Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2016 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on28June 2016.
Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The companys shares are listed ontheLondon Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance The groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2016 prior year 52 weeks ended 3 May 2015.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related parties, Greene King Finance plc and Spirit Issuer plc.
Greene King Finance plc and Spirit Issuer plc are structured entities set up to raise bond finance for the group.
As Greene King plc has full control over both entities they are fully consolidated.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year end asthe parent company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
New standards and interpretations which came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Significant accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or useful life ofthe asset.
There is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, if appropriate, ateach financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Profit or loss on derecognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is included in the income statement in the year of derecognition.
Intangible assets Operating lease intangibles The fair value attached to operating leasehold interests on acquisition are deemed to represent lease premiums, and are carried as intangible assets.
Theoperating lease intangible is amortised over the period of the lease.
Brand intangibles Brand intangible assets recognised on acquisition are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives 15 years.
Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
The choice of measurement of non-controlling interests, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets, is determined on a transaction bytransaction basis.
Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value ofthe contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability is recognised in the income statement.
If the contingent consideration isclassified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
82 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Impairment Property, plant and equipment Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment.
If an indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group.
An assets or cash-generating units recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets.
If there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment.
Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating segment animpairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date has been carried forward as the carrying value.
Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves.
Such goodwill has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are derecognised when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the groups beer.
Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active market and have therefore been designated as Loans and receivables, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired.
If there is evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the expected future receipts excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Raw materials are valued at average cost.
Finished goods and work in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management is committed to the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and is no longer depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 83 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Finance income is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value and the movement is recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting is adopted.
For interest rate swaps where hedge accounting is not applied the fair value movement is analysed between pre-exceptional finance costs and exceptional finance costs.
Pre-exceptional finance costs includes cash payments or receipts on the interest rate swaps so as to show the underlying fixed rate on the debt with the remaining fair value movement which is generally the movement in the carrying value of the swap in the period reflected as an exceptional item.
For derivatives acquired at a non-zero fair value e. g. on acquisition the amortisation of the initial fair value is recognised in pre-exceptional finance costs to offset the cash payments or receipts.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the groups risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability or forecast transaction.
The group uses certain of its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised in Other comprehensive income OCI, whilst any ineffective portion isrecognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the OCI are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously recognised inOCI are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, thecumulative gain or loss recognised in OCI is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Off market contract liabilities Off market contract liabilities are recognised where contracts are at unfavourable terms relative to current market terms on acquisition.
For leases where the current rentals are below market terms, the related asset is considered to be included within the residual value of the leasehold pub.
For other acquired pubs an off market liability has been calculated as the difference between the present value of future contracted rentals and the present value of future market rate rentals.
The liability unwinds against the rental expense so that the income statement charge reflects current market terms.
The off market contract liability is increased by the unwinding of the discount at acquisition using the effective rate applied in measuring the off market contract liabilities at the date of acquisition and decreased by utilisation which is unwound against rental expense in the income statement so that the income statement charge reflects current market terms.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits Defined benefit pension schemes The group operates three defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds.
The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
Any remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured and the resulting gain or loss is recognised intheincome statement in the same period.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability asset by the discount rate both asdetermined at the start of the annual reporting period, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period asaresult of contributions and benefit payments.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes obligations less the fair value ofscheme assets.
Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes The cost of the groups defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made.
Contributions are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
84 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions service and performance, other than market conditions performance linked to the price of the shares of the company.
Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest.
The periodic charge or credit is the movement inthe cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and or service conditions have not been met.
Whereawards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The group has an employee benefit trust for the granting ofshares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue Generally, revenue represents external sales excluding taxes of goods and services, net of discounts.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products.
Revenue principally consists of drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, and rental income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
The accrued value for rebates payable is included within other payables.
Supplier rebates Supplier rebates are included within operating profit as they are earned.
The accrued value at the reporting date is included within other receivables.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are recognised asan expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as current theportion relating to the next financial period or non-current prepayments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The fair values attached to operating head leasehold interests on acquisitions are deemed to represent lease premiums, and are carried as intangible assets.
These operating leases are capitalised at cost and amortised over the period of the lease.
See Off market contract liabilities for the accounting policy where the fair values of operating leases are a liability.
Finance leases Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are recognised at acquisition at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Theasset is then depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
A corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to achieve aconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in finance costs.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents capital contributions received and amounts recognised on the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company Limited being thedifference between the value of the consideration and the nominal value of the shares issued as consideration.
Taxes Income tax The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax.
It is calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised in OCI and equity are recognised in OCI and equity respectively.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 85 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued Taxes continued Deferred tax continued The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset income tax assets and income tax liabilities andthey relate to the same taxable entity and same tax authority and when it is the intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised in OCI and equity are recognised in OCI and equity respectively.
Uncertain tax positions Provision for uncertain tax positions is based on an assessment of the tax treatment of certain transactions.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is probable that a liability will arise.
The group reviews its uncertain tax positions each period in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment.
Exceptional items The group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the income statement.
Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size, nature or expected frequency, to allow a better understanding of the underlying performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied As at the date of approval of the financial statements there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group.
These are expected to be applied as follows: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 2009 and has since been amended several times.
A complete version of the standard was issued in July 2014 and is a replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 covers the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a new hedge accounting model and the new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment.
The new standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU adoption.
The group is currently considering the impact of IFRS 9 on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in May 2014.
The new standard provides a single, five-step revenue recognition model, applicable to all sales contracts, which is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.
This standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance under current IFRS and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The group is currently considering the impact of IFRS 15 on its consolidated results and financial position.
IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases which requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for most leases.
For lessors, there is little change to the existing accounting in IAS 17 Leases.
The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Early application is permitted, provided the new standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been applied, or is applied at the same date as IFRS 16.
The group is currently considering the impact of adopting IFRS 16 on its consolidated results and financial position.
Other standards and interpretations that are relevant to the group have been assessed as having no significant financial impact or additional disclosure requirements at this time.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and judgments considered to be significant are detailed below.
Taxation Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation.
Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the income statement and or cash flow in future periods.
The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Refer to note 10 for further details.
86 GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting judgments and estimates continued Share-based payments Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the groups share-based payment plans.
Note 8 describes the key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values.
In addition estimates are made of the number of awards that will ultimately vest and judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market-based performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are disclosed in note 9.
Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Note 9 describes the key assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are shown in note 13.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment.
This requires an estimation of the value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal at an individual pub level.
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the sensitivity to changes inkey assumptions.
Residual values Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends.
If residual values were lower than estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required.
Useful lives are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Property provisions The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where rental expense is in excess of income.
The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal and external property experts.
However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level of provision recorded.
Business combinations For the business combination the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been valued at fair value.
This requires a number of estimates with the details on the fair valuation being disclosed in note 17.
Additionally, the goodwill acquired in the business combination was allocated to the operating segments of the group, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to those segments see note 13 for allocation.
2 Segment information Following the acquisition of Spirit Pub Company on 23 June 2015 the group had five reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according to the nature of products and services provided, distribution channels and profile of customers.
The segments include the following businesses: Pub Company: Managed pubs and restaurants Greene King and Spirit Pub Partners: Tenanted and leased pubs Greene King and Spirit Brewing & Brands: Brewing, marketing and selling beer These are also considered to be the groups operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
No aggregation of operating segments has been made.
Following the back-office integration of the Greene King and Spirit businesses from the start of the next financial year, the group has reverted to three reportable segments: Pub Company, Pub Partners and Brewing & Brands.
Segmental information presented in respect of the prior year is for the three Greene King reportable segments.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 2 Segment information continued Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arms length basis.
Unallocated assets liabilities comprise cash, borrowings, pensions, net deferred tax, net current tax, derivatives and VAT provision acquired.
Prior year assets and liabilities have been restated for the 33.7m deferred tax liability that has been offset against deferred tax assets as detailed in note 10.
EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items and is calculated as operating profit before exceptionals adjusted for the depreciation andamortisation charge for the period.
Management reporting and controlling systems Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
Segment performance is measured based on segment operating profit or loss referred to as trading profit in our management and reporting systems.
Included within the corporate column in the table above are functions managed by a central division.
No information about geographical regions has been provided as the groups activities are predominantly domestic.

During the period to 1 May 2016 the group has recognised a net impairment loss of 32.2m 2015: 27.4m.
This is comprised of an impairment charge of 79.5m 2015: 27.4m and reversal of previously recognised impairment losses of 47.3m 2015: nil.
The impairment charge includes 1.4m in respect of properties damaged by fire in the year.
A 4.8m charge has also been recognised in respect of IT assets acquired with Spirit that will not form part ofthe IT infrastructure post integration.
Impairment of 73.3m has been recognised in respect of a small number of pubs and is driven by changes in the local competitive and trading environment at the respective sites, and changes to estimates of fair value less costs of disposal.
In addition to this impairment, reversals have been recognised following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows for previously impaired sites or increases to fair value less costs of disposal.
In the period, the group received further insurance compensation to meet the costs of restoring sites fire damaged in a previous period totalling 0.5m 2015: 0.1m.
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment and goodwill of 23.3m 2015: 0.1m profit comprises a total profit on disposal of 50.1m 2015: 10.2m and a total loss on disposal of 26.8m 2015: 10.1m.
The net profit on disposal is made up of the following segments: Pub Company Greene King 2.7m profit, Pub Partners Greene King 17.5m profit, Pub Company Spirit 0.5m loss, Pub Partners Spirit 0.9m loss andCorporate 4.5m profit.
In the prior period the group incurred 1.5m of exceptional employee costs, which included restructuring costs and costs associated with changes to key management.
In addition a share-based payment credit of 0.6m was recognised which resulted from the reversal of charges recognised in earlier years following a reassessment of expected scheme performance.
Exceptional finance costs The 1.3m fair value loss 2015: 2.4m loss is the mark-to-market movement on the ineffective element of cash flow hedges resulting from changes inthe LIBOR yield curve note 24.
During the period the group acquired as part of the business combination derivatives that are subsequently accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as opposed to existing derivatives which are designated in hedge relationships.
The exceptional charge relates to the mark-to-market movement on these derivatives, excluding amortisation of the fair value on acquisition which reduces the pre-exceptional finance costs that include the interest paid note 24.
Exceptional tax The tax credit in respect of the licensed estate has arisen from movements in their tax base cost, including the impact of indexation.
2 Act 2015 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
These rate reductions were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore included in these accounts.
The net deferred tax asset has been calculated using the rates at which each temporary difference is expected to reverse.
The effect of these rate reductions is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 2.7m comprising a credit to the income statement of 4.8m and a debit to the group statement of comprehensive income and equity of 7.5m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods income tax in 2015 arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods including the reversal of tax relief previously taken on intra-group transactions.
On 6 June 2016 a formal agreement was reached on a number of historical tax positions, in respect of which 9m remains payable, excluding Sussex which will be heard by the Court of Appeal on 4 July 2016.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods deferred tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods and also deferred tax on revaluation and rolled over gains on the licensed estate.
During the period the group recognised a deferred tax credit of 26.8m in relation to revaluation and rolled over gains on the licensed estate following correspondence with HMRC which clarified the treatment of certain judgmental items that led to a change in the groups estimation of base cost.

In prior periods a deferred bonus scheme and an executive share option scheme ESOS have also been operated.
The general terms of the LTIP Growth LTIP are detailed in the directors remuneration report on pages 59 to 64.
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions is 7.1m 2015: 3.4m.
A corresponding credit of 6.2m 2015: 3.1m has been recognised in equity.
The increase is due to a change in estimate on the expected result ofperformance conditions.
The fair value of the LTIP Growth LTIP issued since 2015 is considered to be equal to the share price on the date of issue.
For 2016 issue the fair value was 8.63p 2015: 8.40p per share option.
Future dividend payments have not been factored into the valuation as participants are entitled to dividend payments.
The fair value of previously issued LTIPs were estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
The fair value of other equity-settled options are estimated using a Black-Scholes model.
The fair values of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: 2016 2015 SAYE SAYE Weighted average share price 870p 857p Exercise price 726p 590p Expected dividend yield 3.9% 3.6% Risk-free rate of return 0.6% 0.7% Volatility 21.2% 20.1% Expected life years 3.3 3.3 Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 140p 215p Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future trends.
Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period.
This is not necessarily indicative of future exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.

ESOS, SAYE and LTIP Options were exercised on a range of dates.
The weighted average share price through the period was 856p in 2016 and 809p in 2015.
The rights outstanding at 1 May 2016 under the LTIP had an exercise price of nil 2015: nil and a weighted average remaining contractual life of1.4years 2015: 1.3 years.
The outstanding options for the SAYE scheme had an exercise price of between 368p and 726p 2015: 349p and 701p and the weighted average remaining contractual life was 3.4 years 2015: 3.4 years.
In the prior year outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price of 528p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.3 years.
9 Pensions The group maintains three defined contribution schemes, which are open to all new employees, and three defined benefit schemes.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits previously offered to employees to cover any medical costs after employment.
This benefit is no longer given to employees.
Defined contribution pension schemes Member funds for the defined contribution schemes are held and administered by the Friends Life Group.
The total cost recognised in operating profit for the period was 6.7m 2015: 4.6m.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 9 Pensions continued Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are closed to new entrants and are closed to future accrual.
Only administrative costs are incurred going forward.
All schemes have had full actuarial valuations in the last three years: Greene King Pension Scheme last valued as at April 2015, Belhaven Pension Scheme last valued May 2014 and Spirit Legacy Scheme last valued April 2015.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the groups finances and are administered by pension trustees.
Pension benefits are related to members final salary at the earlier of retirement or closure to future accrual and their length of service.
Since the pension liability is adjusted for the changes to consumer price index, the pension plan is exposed to inflation, interest rate risks and changes inthe life expectancy for pensioners.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equity shares of entities in manufacturing and consumer product sector, the group is also exposed to equity market risk arising in the manufacturing and consumer products sector.
The significant increase inequities and bonds is due to the acquisition of Spirit.
The majority of the bonds relate to UK government and corporate bonds.

At 1 May 2016, the group had unused trading losses of 12.6m 2015: nil and unused capital losses of 815.5m 2015: 32.0m.
A deferred tax asset of2.5m 2015: nil has been recognised in respect of trading losses and a deferred tax asset of 11.7m 2015: 6.4m in respect of capital losses where tax losses are expected to be utilised against future profits and gains.
Current legislation allows all of the groups tax losses to be carried forward for an unlimited period.
Prior year restatement The comparatives have been restated to reflect the netting of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as in the current year, the net impact being that a 33.7m 2014: 38.0m deferred tax liability has been offset against deferred tax assets.
Factors that may affect future tax charges The Finance Act No.
The effect of these rate reductions is to reduce the net deferred tax asset by a net 2.7m comprising a credit to the income statement of 4.8m and a debit to the group statement of comprehensive income and equity of 7.5m as explained in note 5.
In addition the Finance Bill 2016 further reduces the rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This further reduction had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date so is not included in these accounts.
However, it will further reduce the net deferred tax asset at the balance sheet date by 3.0m and the groups income tax charge in future periods.

Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 1.6m 2015: 1.6m dilutive potential shares under option, giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 297.8m 2015: 219.9m.
There were no 2015: nil anti-dilutive share options excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
The performance conditions for share options granted over 1.6m 2015: 1.5m shares have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of shares which would have been issued at the period end has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group on both a basic and diluted basis.

Brand intangibles are amortised over the expected life of the asset 15 years.
Operating lease intangibles are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease with a weighted average useful life of 26 years.
All goodwill was recognised as part of business combinations.
As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised butissubject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated as follows: 2016 2015 m m Pub Company Greene King 566.3 352.7 Pub Company Spirit 133.6 Pub Partners Greene King 169.5 133.7 Pub Partners Spirit 17.6 Brewing & Brands 234.9 214.5 1,121.9 700.9 Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year.
The amount disposed iscalculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 13 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill disposed of in the year: 2016 2015 m m Pub Company Greene King 4.3 0.8 Pub Partners Greene King 8.7 2.1 13.0 2.9 The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one year budgets approved bythe board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to sales prices, volumes, business mix andmargin, based on the current estate.
Cash flows are discounted at 8.65% 2015: 9.0%, which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant operating segment.
As risk factors are considered to be similar in each of the groups operating segments the same level of discount rate is applied to all.
A growth rate of 1.75% in Pub Company 2015: 1.00%, 2.50% in Pub Partners 2015: 1.00% and 1.00% in Brewing & Brands 2015: 1.00% has been used to extrapolate cash flows.
The growth rate is below the long-term average growth rate for the operating segments and reflects trends in trading performance.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate.
Management considers that reasonably possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1%pt, a reduction in growth rate of 1%pt or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow.
As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use calculation in isolation or individually neither a 1% reduction in growth rate, a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow, nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an impairment of goodwill in the period.
In the prior year a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an impairment of 4.6m to the goodwill allocated to Pub Partners, with the carrying amount equalling the recoverable amount at a discount rate of 9.9%.

A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal.
Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS: therefore, no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value.
These valuations havebeen retained but they have not been updated.
Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of 1,446.2m 2015: 1,425.2m and 1,519.1m 2015: nil over which there is a first charge in favour of the securitised debt holders of the Greene King secured financing vehicle and the Spirit secured financing vehicle respectively.
Assets held under finance leases The group leases various licensed properties, offices and other commercial properties and other assets under finance leases.
The leases have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Included in property, plant and equipment above are properties held under finance leases with a net book value of 22.3m 2015: nil.

The recoverable amount for assets impaired was based on value in use of 25.2m and fair value less cost of disposal of 47.3m.
The recoverable amount for assets with impairment reversal was based on value in use of 43.0m and fair value less cost of disposal of 4.6m.
These are analysed between the groups principal reporting segments as shown below: 2016 2015 Reversal of Net Reversal of Net Impairment impairment impairment Impairment impairment impairment m m m m m m Pub Company Greene King 56.6 33.5 23.1 21.1 21.1 Pub Partners Greene King 17.4 13.8 3.6 6.3 6.3 Corporate 5.5 5.5 79.5 47.3 32.2 27.4 27.4 The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit CGU.
Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
Whenindicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use.
The group estimates value-in-use using a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions used are expected cash flow projections for the next year, the discount rate applied to those cash flows of 8.65% 2015: 9.00% and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 1.75% in Pub Company 2015: 1.00% and 2.50% in Pub Partners 2015: 1.00% which are below the long-term average growth rate for the operating segments and reflect trends in trading performance.
Cash flow projections relating to individual CGUs have been made based on historic trends adjusted for managements estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
Estimates of fair value less costs of disposal are based on an external valuation with the latest valuation being performed in 2015 2016.
The valuation considers assumptions such as current and future projected income levels, which take account of the location and quality of the pub.
In addition recent market transactions in the sector and potential alternative use values have been considered.
The valuation techniques applied are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
As they use significant unobservable inputs they are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: this hierarchy is further explained in note 24.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 101 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 14 Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment of property, plant and equipment continued The impairment charge recognised in relation to a small number of pubs was driven by changes in the local competitive and trading environment at their respective sites, and decisions taken to exit some sites where current market values are lower than book values.
The impairment reversals have been recognised following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows for previously impaired sites.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections.
The net impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth rates used to calculate cash flow projections and the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows: Increased net impairment resulting from: a 10% reduction in fair a 1% increase a 1% reduction value less cost of disposal in discount rate in growth rate 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m m m Pub Company 9.8 10.5 11.7 5.0 11.7 5.0 Pub Partners 2.2 2.3 3.1 1.0 3.1 1.0 12.0 12.8 14.8 6.0 14.8 6.0 No impairment was recognised in relation to the Spirit estate and as such the above sensitivities only include the Greene King estate.

Goodwill has arisen primarily due to expected operating synergies, in recognition of managements proven track record, and as a result of opportunities that are expected to arise to optimise performance in the enlarged groups pub estate.
The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is nil.
The goodwill arising on acquisition has been allocated to the operating segments based on the forecast level of synergies expected by operating segment.
The fair value of properties acquired including operating leases was established following a review of properties that was carried out by external qualified surveyors.
Properties have been revalued at their existing use value giving consideration to the highest and best use of the properties.
The values of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or paid respectively.
Off-market contract liabilities of 312.7m have been recognised upon acquisition where contracts are at unfavourable terms relative to current market terms.
For other acquired pubs an off-market liability has been calculated as the difference between the present value of future contracted rentals and the present value of future market rate rentals.
External qualified surveyors were engaged to provide a formal evaluation of current market rentals for the acquired leased pub assets.
Rental growth rates of 2.02.5% were taken from market consensus forecasts for the retail sector and a discount rate of 5% was applied, being the estimated incremental borrowing costs of the acquired business, to arrive at the present value of market rentals.
Brand Intangibles of 16.1m have been recognised to the extent that a format provides a profit benefit versus similar unbranded pubs.
Brand intangibles are being amortised over a useful economic life of 15 years.
Trade receivables acquired have gross contractual value of 8.9m, the best estimate of amounts not expected to be collected is 1.4m and therefore the fair value recognised is 7.5m.
Other receivables and prepayments have a gross contracted amount of 35.1m: the best estimate of amounts not expected to be collected is 1.5m and therefore a fair value of 33.6m has been recognised.
Further details on provisions acquired are disclosed in note 26.

The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, a group company.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
Liquidity facility In 2014 the standby liquidity facility provider to the Greene King secured financing vehicle had its short-term credit rating downgraded below the minimum prescribed in the facility agreement and as such the group exercised its entitlement to draw the full amount of the facility and hold it in a designated bank account.
The corresponding balance of 157.5m 2015: 157.5m held in this bank account is included within cash and cash equivalents.
The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisations debt service obligations should there ever be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments.
As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash.

Obligations under finance leases Upon acquisition of Spirit Pub Company on 23 June 2015, the group acquired leases of property, plant and equipment, where it substantially has all therisks and reward of ownership, and which have been classified as finance leases.
In the balance sheet a corresponding liability has been included asafinance lease obligation.

If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives tomanage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdrafts, secured bonds, cash and short-term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade and other receivables, trade payables and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the groups operations and financing sources.
No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the groups borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be at a fixed rate.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
Certain swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, andtested for effectiveness every 6 months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
Thisanalysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 1 May 2016 and 3 May 2015.
The analysis relates only to balances at these dates and is not representative of the year asa whole.
The following assumptions were made: Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change asinterest rates move.
Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end.
Based on the groups net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the groups profit before tax by approximately 50.6m 2015: 0.6m and the groups OCI by 82.9m 2015: 87.6m.
Whilst cash flow interest rate risk is largely eliminated, the use of fixed rate borrowings and derivative financial instruments exposes the group to fair value interest rate risk such that the group would not significantly benefit from falls in interest rates and would be exposed to unplanned costs, suchasbreak costs, should debt or derivative financial instruments be restructured or repaid early.
The percentage of net debt that was fixed as at the year end was 96.1% 2015: 95.5%, in line with the groups policy of fixing at least 95% of all net debt.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
The groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the group has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end 2015: 60 days following month end.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month.
Short-term flexibility isachieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets under the groups revolving credit facility.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at 1 May 2016 and 3 May 2015 based on contractual undiscounted payments including interest.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation and the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited by investment of surplus funds with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts toanon-significant level.
There is no significant collateral held and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting At 1 May 2016 the group held 2 2015: 3 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 100m 2015: 135m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of the 315.0m 2015: 248.3m drawn down from the revolving credit facility in the year.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 34.6m 2015: 32.8m.
The cash flows occurred quarterly based a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 1 May 2016 the group held 5 2015: 5 interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of 530.0m 2015: 558.1m, entered into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps.
A fair value liability of 214.6m 2015: 204.1m has been recognised on the balance sheet in respect ofthese contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against 530.0m 2015: 558.1m of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 7.0% 2015: 7.0%.
The contract maturity dates range from September 2021 to March 2036.
Retrospective quantitative hedge effectiveness testing is performed and the bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms excluding credit risk.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The interest rate swaps have been assessed as highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over their remaining contract lives.
The ineffectiveness amounting to a 0.3m gain 2015: 0.8m loss has been recognised within finance costs income.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting Interest rate swap agreements have been acquired as part of the business combination with Spirit Pub Company which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.681% on the Class A1, Class A2 and Class A6 notes and, after their respective step-up dates, 4.555% on the Class A3, Class A4, Class A5 and Class A7 notes.
The swaps were deemed ineffective hedges and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting, with movements in their fair value being recognised in the income statement.
The interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of 191.7m 2015: nil.
Thecash flows occurred quarterly based a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
The fair value movement from acquisition splits into cash payments made of 21.7m recognised in pre-exceptional finance costs net of amortisation of fair value on acquisition of 12.3m.
The remainder of the fair value movement is recognised as a charge in exceptional finance costs amounting to 39.1m.
Where the nominal value of the derivative exceeds that of the related secured note for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging where this is financially practicable.
At 1 May 2016, there were 5.7m of interest swaps outstanding on cancelled floating rate notes which relate to the Spirit secured debt.
Fair values Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the groups financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Cash and cash equivalents comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits approximates to the carrying amount stated in the accounts.
Trade receivables approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Financial assets these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt: approximates to the carrying amount in the case of the floating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the accounts continued For the fifty-two weeks ended 1 May 2016 24 Financial instruments continued Fair values continued Interest rate swaps calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date and adjusting, where appropriate, for the groups and counterparty's credit risk.
The changes in credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships.
Trade payables and accruals approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Finance lease obligations and off-market contract liabilities excludes off-market lease liability estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to derive fair value.
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the periods ending 1 May 2016 and 3 May 2015 there were no transfers between level 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements.
Capital risk management The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted average cost of capital WACC and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage net debt and equity levels together referred to as capital as disclosed on the balance sheet, as appropriate in light of economic and trading conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment toshareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures, including fixed charge cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and free cash flow debt service coverage.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net interest on debt before exceptional items note 7.
For the period to 1 May 2016 interest cover was 3.3x 2015: 3.0x.
All covenants in relation to the securitisation vehicles and bank loans have been fully complied with.
The boards dividend policy is to maintain a minimum dividend cover of two times adjusted basic earnings per share.

VAT provision During a previous period Spirit received VAT refunds of 7.0m and 17.9m from HMRC in respect of gaming machines following a ruling involving TheRank Group plc Rank that the application of VAT contravened the EUs principal of fiscal neutrality.
HMRC successfully appealed the decision inOctober 2013 and Spirit was therefore required to repay the VAT refund of 7.0m and associated interest of 1.7m.
However, HMRC did not seek torecover the VAT refund of 17.9m and associated interest of 5.5m because it had accepted a guarantee from Spirit that it would only repay this VAT if Ranks litigation is finally determined in HMRCs favour.
Ranks latest appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court in July 2015 and the group is currently awaiting the outcome of related litigation.
