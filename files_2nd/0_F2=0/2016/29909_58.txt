This more closely reflects the nature of software assets which typically have both purchased and internally developed components.
The closing net carrying value of 1,374m at 28 February 2015 was previously disclosed in internally generated development costs of 750m, pharmacy and software licences of 579m and other intangibles assets of 45m.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
