Audit scope The significant components of our audit cover the reportable segments identified in the financial statements together with the central functions of the Group based in the UK and overseas and include Finance, the Services function and Treasury.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components and audit procedures on specific balances for a further four components.
The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 93% or more of Group, total income, equity and total assets.
Materiality Overall Group materiality has been set at 270 million which represents 0.5% of total equity.
278 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Performing a first year audit In preparation for our first year audit of the 31 December 2016 financial statements, we performed a number of transitional procedures.
Following our selection, we undertook procedures to establish our independence of the Group.
This involved ceasing commercial relationships and changing financial arrangements as independent auditor and ensuring that all staff who work on the audit worldwide are independent of the Group.
We used the time prior to commencing any audit work to gain an understanding of the business issues and meet with key management.
We became independent in July 2015 from which time we shadowed the former auditors through the 31 December 2015 year-end audit process, gaining an understanding of the Groups processes, including the risk assessment and key judgements made by the former auditors.
Alongside the predecessor auditor we attended key meetings with management, met the non-executive directors and attended the Group Audit Committee and the Business Risk Committee as observers.
In July 2015 we held an initial two day event attended by the audit partners and senior staff responsible for auditing the main business, functions and overseas subsidiaries of the Group.
This provided an opportunity for the entire team to prepare themselves for the audit and start to consider the audit team structure, the alignment of our audit approach and the deployment of audit analytic tools.
Following this event we issued instructions to our audit teams for the first 90 days of transition covering the review of predecessor auditors working papers and the identification and assessment of risks, judgements and potential audit and accounting issues.
We used the understanding the audit team had formed to establish our audit base and assist in the formalisation of our audit strategy for the 2016 Group audit.
This involved gaining an understanding of the Groups key processes and controls over financial reporting.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that merited the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.
In addressing these risks, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
In identifying the risks of material misstatement below, we considered the risk of management override of internal control over financial reporting, including the impact on the recognition of revenue.

Adequacy of disclosures of contingent liabilities 280 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee We are satisfied that the Groups provisions for conduct, litigation and regulatory matters, customer remediation and claims are within a reasonable range and recognised in accordance with IFRS.
We did not identify any material unrecorded provisions.
We highlighted the following matters: In considering the total U. S. RMBS provision of 6.8 billion, management and the Board considered other industry settlements and claims.
It is a reasonable reflection of the Groups current position given developments in Q4 given the prevailing uncertainty as to the outcome of the discussions with the U. S. Department of Justice.
The risk of future substantial additional charges and costs is appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.
The provision for the remaining claimants for the UK shareholder action incorporates assumptions which are reasonable for the purpose of determining a provision under IAS37.
The PPI provision remains sensitive to key assumptions, such as future complaint volumes, time barring and Plevin outcomes.
Managements estimate was within our range of possible outcomes based on reasonable alternative assumptions.
The provision related to the FCA review of RBSs treatment of SMEs is sensitive to a number of assumptions.
We consider it is reasonable based on the information available at this time.
The Group Audit Committee also discussed and approved the recording of a provision of 750m in the 2016 annual accounts, as a consequence of a revised proposal presented by HM Treasury to the European Commission in February 2017.
This proposal envisages that RBS will deliver a package of remedies to promote competition in the market for banking services to SMEs in the UK.
It remains subject to a consultation exercise by the European Commission and approval by the College of Commissioners as well as a markettesting exercise by HM Treasury.
We discussed and agreed the quantum of the provision, based on managements assessment of the cost to deliver the package of remedies and their conclusion that it met the criteria to be recorded as an adjusting post balance sheet event.

Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee We are satisfied that the carrying values of deferred tax assets, goodwill and, in the parent company accounts, investments in subsidiaries are reasonable and in compliance with IFRS.
The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying amounts when key assumptions are stressed.
We highlighted the results of our sensitivity analysis of the carrying values to key assumptions in the forecasts including the long term growth rate, discount rate and factors impacting the underlying level of profitability both at a Group level and for individual franchises.
We noted the inherent uncertainty of the five year forecasts and the difficulty predicting revenue and costs over this period, particularly with respect to the impact of banking Structural Reform and the economic consequences of the EU referendum and other political developments over an extended period.
We also noted the independent review of the forecasts undertaken by the Risk function and managements challenge of the carrying values and key assumptions in relevant executive committees of the Group.
We considered the key assumptions impacting the forecast recovery period for material deferred tax assets and the extension of the recovery period for its subsidiary, National Westminster Bank Plc, from 5 to 6 years given the underlying profitability of this business.

For modelled provisions, we tested the inputs and used our credit risk specialists to test the assumptions and calculations.
We examined the methodology to establish model parameters and assessed the appropriateness of the models used.
Where possible, assumptions were benchmarked against pillar 3, EBA stress tests and our internally developed ranges.
Where overlays were made as a result of limitations in existing models, we confirmed the extent of the model shortcoming, recalculated the overlay and assessed the appropriateness of the adjustment.
Based on current economic events, we considered the need for sector or systemic overlay adjustments.
We performed a sample of loan reviews on performing loans to establish our own view as to whether any IAS 39 loss indicators were present.
For non-performing loans, we tested a sample of loan reviews, focusing on high risk sectors such as shipping, oil and gas and commercial real estate.
With the support of our valuation specialists, we assessed the measurement of the provision by testing the valuation of collateral where relevant.
We examined other cash flow assumptions where the level of provision is not dependent on collateral values.
We also assessed the reasonableness of the timing of the cash flows estimated.
We assessed the appropriateness and presentation of disclosures with relevant accounting standards.
Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee We are satisfied that impairment provisions were reasonable and in compliance with IFRS.
We highlighted the following: We discussed our benchmarking comparison for certain models which indicated that the assumptions were within an acceptable range of outcomes.
The data used as inputs into the models and calculators is materially complete and accurate.
For individually assessed impairments we did not identify material differences of judgement in respect of the provision and we were satisfied with the completeness of the identification of loss events.

Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee We are satisfied that the fair value of financial instruments with higher risk characteristics and the recognition of related income is reasonable and in accordance with IFRS.
We highlighted the following: Our independent valuation of a sample of derivatives were either within our threshold or, where initially outside, were corroborated by other data, for example, trade exit activity, valuation adjustments for model or data limitations, or benchmarking to peer practice.
Valuations of hard-to-price cash positions were within our thresholds.

We tested the fair value of scheme assets by independently calculating a fair value for a sample of the assets held.
Our sample included cash, equity instruments, and derivative financial instruments.
We also tested the existence of the sampled pension assets by obtaining written confirmation from the pension asset custodian and by examining the relevant legal documentation.
We also reviewed Board and Executive Committee minutes where the pension valuation was discussed to assess the effectiveness of managements review process and the appropriateness of the conclusions reached.
285 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee We are satisfied that the pension valuation and retirement benefit obligations recorded at 31 December 2016 are reasonable and in accordance with IFRS.
We highlighted the results of our internal benchmarking of key actuarial assumptions including the discount rate, inflation, mortality, and the rate of increase of salary and pension payments.
We noted that assumptions tested are within a reasonable range.
We also presented the results of our independent valuation of a sample of pension assets.
In determining the accounting for the pension scheme we considered the impact of IFRIC 14 on the amount of the surplus recognised and compliance with IFRS.

In addition, we sought to understand where relevant, changes were made to the IT landscape during the audit period.
Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee We are satisfied that IT controls relevant to financial reporting operated effectively as at year-end.
A number of user access related deficiencies were identified.
Management identified compensating controls to mitigate these findings and undertook additional work to evidence that access was not used inappropriately.
We tested the work undertaken by management and performed additional audit procedures over impacted balances.
Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts Report of the Group Audit Committee page 71 Accounting policies page 297 Our risks of material misstatement are consistent with the risks identified by the predecessor auditor in the prior year, with the exception of our inclusion of hedge effectiveness volatility including non-interest income from trading activities.
We included this additional risk in consideration of the judgemental nature and the impact it could have on earnings, given its significance in 2016.
The scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each component of the Group.
Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the financial statements.
We take into account the size and risk profile of the component and its activities, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.
Our audit of the significant components covers the reportable segments identified in the financial statements, together with the central functions of the Group based in the UK and overseas, and includes Finance, the Services function and Treasury.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to establish that we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected nine components covering activities in the UK and 10 other countries, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Our audit scope was consistent with that of the predecessor auditor in 2015.
286 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Of the 9 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
For the remaining four components specific scope components, we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the accounts and disclosures in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.

As the Group made a loss during the year, we considered total assets, total revenue, total equity and the absolute value of the amounts in the income statement meaning the magnitude of the amounts without regard to their positive or negative value to verify we had appropriate overall coverage on the income statement.

Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken in each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors in the United Kingdom or from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
Of the five full scope components, audit procedures were performed on one of these directly by the primary audit engagement team.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The primary audit engagement team interacted regularly with the component audit teams where appropriate throughout the course of the audit, which included holding planning meetings, maintaining regular communications on the status of the audits, reviewing key working papers and responsibility for the scope and direction of the audit process.
The primary audit engagement team also participated in meetings with key management personnel in the components and, for certain overseas locations, implemented a programme of planned visits.
These visits involved discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work, as well as meeting with local management.
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality The magnitude of omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 270 million predecessor auditor 2015 materiality: 300 million, which was calculated as 0.5% of the total equity of the Group.
This represented 5% of the Groups loss for the year.
We considered that equity represented a relevant measure used by investors, regulators and other stakeholders when assessing the Group.
Our materiality was based on the equity of the Group given the significant losses and volatility of results in recent years, which is consistent with the basis used by the predecessor auditor in the prior year.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and have made no subsequent adjustments.
Note: 1 Full scope: audit procedures on all significant accounts 2 Specific scope: audit procedures on selected accounts 3 Other procedures: considered in analytical procedures 287 Independent auditors report to the members of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and corrected misstatements exceed materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% of our planning materiality, namely 135 million.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage which is at the lowest end of the range as this is our initial year of audit of the Group.
Audit work of component teams for the purpose of obtaining coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component team is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated by the primary audit engagement team to components was between 50 million and 100 million.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Group Audit Committee that we would report to them all corrected and uncorrected audit misstatements in excess of 14 million, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative and qualitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Decisions in relation to credit deterioration will be management decisions, subject to approval by governing bodies such as the Group Provisions Committee.
The staging assessment requires a definition of when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred: this moves the loss calculation for financial assets from a 12 month horizon to a lifetime horizon.
Management propose to establish an approach that is primarily informed by the increase in lifetime probability of default, with additional qualitative measures to account for assets where PD does not move, but a high risk factor is determined, these include the Risk of Credit Loss framework and binary triggers examples includes the use of payday lending, forbearance and 30 days past due.
In most cases, management expect an asset that has demonstrated a doubling of its lifetime probability of default would be considered to have a significant increase in credit risk.
IFRS 9 includes an option that permits assets that are low risk to be excluded from this assessment: the Group does not intend to apply this option.

The sterling yield curve applied to 93% of the Groups defined benefit obligations is constructed by reference to yields on AA corporate bonds from which a single discount rate is derived based on a cash flow profile similar in structure and duration to the pension obligations.

Significant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

The sensitivity to pension liabilities is the difference between these calculations.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
At the same time it entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Trustee that included advancing the date of the 31 March 2016 triennial funding valuation to 31 December 2015.
Consequently, the next triennial valuation does not need to be agreed until 31 March 2020.
In June 2016, the triennial funding valuation of the Main scheme as at 31 December 2015 was agreed.
Using the actuarial assumptions set out in the table below which are different to the assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation the pension liabilities calculated at 31 December 2015 totalled 37 billion and the deficit was 5.8 billion, subsequently reduced by the 4.2 billion cash payment in March 2016.
Investment returns over the next 10 year period are forecast to absorb the 1.6 billion balance of the deficit.
The average cost of the future service of current members has increased from 27% to 35% of basic salary before contributions from those members: it includes the expenses of running the scheme.
The Trustee of the Main scheme is responsible for setting the actuarial assumptions used in the triennial funding valuation having taken advice from the Scheme Actuary.
These represent the Trustees prudent estimate of the future experience of the Main scheme taking into account the covenant provided by the Group and the investment strategy of the scheme.
They are agreed with the Group and documented in the Statement of Funding Principles.
The key assumption methodology used in the 31 December 2015 valuation is set out below.
As at that date the funding level disclosed on the assumptions below was 84%.

The Finance No 2 Act 2015 restricts the rate at which tax losses are given credit in future periods to the main rate of UK corporation tax, excluding the Banking Surcharge 8% rate introduced by this Act.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2016 take into account the reduced rates in respect of tax losses and non-banking temporary differences and where appropriate, the banking surcharge inclusive rate in respect of other banking temporary differences.
2 Prior year tax adjustments include releases of tax provisions that reflect the reduction of exposures in countries where RBS is ceasing operations in line with the strategy to become a smaller, simpler UK focused bank.
The prior year tax adjustments also reflect adjustments to reflect submitted tax computations in the UK and overseas.

Financial instruments carried at fair value - valuation hierarchy The following tables show financial instruments carried at fair value on the Groups balance sheet by valuation hierarchy level 1, level 2 and level 3 and related level 3 sensitivities.
Examples include G10 government securities, listed equity shares, certain exchange-traded derivatives and certain US agency securities.
Level 2: valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data.
Instruments in this category are valued using: a quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets which are not considered to be active: or b valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuations are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
Level 2 instruments include non-G10 government securities, most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products, including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, less liquid listed equities, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, and certain money market securities and loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.
Level 3: instruments valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation, is not based on observable market data.
Level 3 instruments primarily include cash instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, certain emerging markets instruments, unlisted equity shares, certain residual interests in securitisations, CDOs, other mortgage-backed products and less liquid debt securities, certain structured debt securities in issue, and OTC derivatives where valuation depends upon unobservable inputs such as certain credit and exotic derivatives.
No gain or loss is recognised on the initial recognition of a financial instrument valued using a technique incorporating significant unobservable data.
2 Transfers between levels are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the quarter in which the instruments were transferred.
There were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2.
3 For an analysis of debt securities by issuer, measurement classification and analysis of asset backed securities and derivatives by type of contract refer to Capital and risk management: Balance sheet analysis Debt securities and Derivatives respectively.
4 The determination of an instruments level cannot be made at a global product level as a single product type can be in more than one level.
For example, a single name corporate credit default swap could be in level 2 or level 3 depending on whether the reference counterpartys obligations are liquid or illiquid.
5 Sensitivity represents the favourable and unfavourable effect on the income statement or the statement of comprehensive income due to reasonably possible changes to valuations using reasonably possible alternative inputs in RBSs valuation techniques or models.
Level 3 sensitivities are calculated on a trade or low level portfolio basis and hence these aggregated figures do not reflect the correlation between some of the sensitivities.
In particular, for some portfolios, the sensitivities may be negatively correlated where a downward movement in one asset would produce an upward movement in another, but due to the additive presentation above, this correlation cannot be shown.
335 Notes on the consolidated accounts 9 Financial instruments - valuation continued Valuation techniques The table below shows a breakdown of valuation techniques and the ranges for those unobservable inputs used in valuation models and techniques that have a material impact on the valuation of level 3 financial instruments.

Movements in the underlying input may have a favourable or unfavourable impact on the valuation depending on the particular terms of the contract and the exposure.
For example, an increase in the credit spread of a bond would be favourable for the issuer but unfavourable for the note holder.
Whilst RBS indicates where it considers that there are significant relationships between the inputs, there inter-relationships will be affected by macro economic factors including interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity index levels.
2 Credit spreads and discount margins: credit spreads and margins express the return required over a benchmark rate or index to compensate for the credit risk associated with a cash instrument.
A higher credit spread would indicate that the underlying instrument has more credit risk associated with it.
Consequently, investors require a higher yield to compensate for the higher risk.
the discount rate comprises credit spread or margin plus the benchmark rate: it is used to value future cash flows.
3 Price and yield: There may be a range of prices used to value an instrument that may be a direct comparison of one instrument or portfolio with another or, movements in a more liquid instrument may be used to indicate the movement in the value of a less liquid instrument.
The comparison may also be indirect in that adjustments are made to the price to reflect differences between the pricing source and the instrument being valued, for example different maturity, credit quality, seniority or expected pay-outs.
Similarly to price, an instruments yield may be compared with other instruments yields either directly or indirectly.
4 Recovery rate: reflects market expectations about the return of principal for a debt instrument or other obligations after a credit event or on liquidation.
Recovery rates tend to move conversely to credit spreads.
5 Valuation: for private equity investments, risk may be measured by beta, estimated by looking at past prices of similar stocks and from valuation statements where valuations are usually derived from earnings measures such as EBITDA or net asset value.
6 Correlation: measures the degree by which two prices or other variables are observed to move together.
If they move in the same direction there is positive correlation: if they move in opposite directions there is negative correlation.
Correlations typically include relationships between: default probabilities of assets in a basket a group of separate assets, exchange rates, interest rates and other financial variables.
7 Volatility: a measure of the tendency of a price to change with time.
8 Interest rate delta: these ranges represent the low high marks on the relevant discounting curve.
9 RBS does not have any material liabilities measured at fair value that are issued with an inseparable third party credit enhancement.

Areas of judgment Whilst the business has simplified, the diverse range of products The majority of derivative instruments for example vanilla interest historically traded by RBS results in a wide range of instruments rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps and liquid single name that are classified into Level 3 of the hierarchy.
Whilst the credit derivatives are classified as Level 2 as they are vanilla majority of these instruments naturally fall into a particular level, products valued using observable inputs.

Non-modelled products Non-modelled products are generally quoted on a price basis and Active and inactive markets can therefore be considered for each of the three levels.
This is A key input in the decision making process for the allocation of determined by the market activity, liquidity and valuation assets to a particular level is market activity.
In general, the uncertainty of the instruments which is in turn measured from the degree of valuation uncertainty depends on the degree of liquidity availability of independent data used by the IPV process to of an input.

This hurdle rate is that used in the IPV process to determine the IPV quality rating.
A key related matter is where a market moves from liquid to However, where an instrument is generally considered to be illiquid or vice versa.
Where this change is considered to be illiquid, but regular quotes from market participants exist, these temporary, the classification is not changed.
For example, if there instruments may be classified as Level 2 depending on frequency is little market trading in a product on a reporting date but at the of quotes, other available pricing and whether the quotes are previous reporting date and during the intervening period the used as part of the IPV process or not.

the classification of the asset.
For example, a tradable quote would be considered a better source than a consensus price.
The breadth and depth of the IPV data allows for a rules based quality assessment to be made of market activity, liquidity and pricing uncertainty, which assists with the process of allocation to an appropriate level.
Where suitable independent pricing information is not readily available, the quality assessment will result in the instrument being assessed as Level 3.

The principal assumptions underlying RBSs provision in respect of PPI sales are: assessment of the total number of complaints that RBS will receive: the proportion of these that will result in redress: and the average cost of such redress.
The number of complaints has been estimated from an analysis of RBSs portfolio of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld the uphold rate have been established based on recent experience, guidance in FCA policy statements and the expected rate of responses from proactive customer contact.
The average redress assumption is based on recent experience and FCA calculation rules.
The table below shows the sensitivity of the provision to changes in the principal assumptions all other assumptions remaining the same.

Interest that will be payable on successful complaints has been included in the provision as has the estimated cost to RBS of administering the redress process.
There are uncertainties as to the eventual cost of redress which will depend on actual complaint volumes, take up and uphold rates and average redress costs.
Assumptions related to these are inherently uncertain and the ultimate financial impact may be different from the amount provided.
We continue to monitor the position closely and refresh the underlying assumptions.
Background information in relation to PPI claims is given in Note 30.

recorded on RBSs balance sheet.
Consolidated structured entities Securitisations In a securitisation, assets, or interests in a pool of assets, are transferred generally to an SE which then issues liabilities to third party investors.
The majority of securitisations are supported through liquidity facilities or other credit enhancements.
RBS arranges securitisations to facilitate client transactions and undertakes own asset securitisations to sell or to fund portfolios of financial assets.
RBS also acts as an underwriter and depositor in securitisation transactions in both client and proprietary transactions.

Commercial paper conduits RBS consolidates a number of asset-backed commercial paper ABCP conduits.
A conduit is an SE that issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to purchase or fund a pool of assets.
The commercial paper is secured on the assets and is redeemed by further commercial paper issuance, repayment of assets or funding from liquidity facilities.
Commercial paper is typically short-dated, usually up to three months.
At 31 December 2016 assets held by the conduits totalled 0.1 billion 2015 - 0.6 billion.
At 31 December 2016 and 2015 the conduits were funded entirely by RBS.
Covered bond programme Certain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships to provide security for issues of debt securities by RBS.
RBS retains all of the risks and rewards of these loans.
The partnerships are consolidated, the loans retained on RBSs balance sheet and the related covered bonds included within debt securities in issue.

393 Parent company financial statements and notes 1 Presentation of accounts The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis refer to the Report of the directors, page 88 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee of the IASB as adopted by the European Union together IFRS.
The company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and are presented in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The company is incorporated in the UK and registered in Scotland.
The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and certain issued securities are stated at fair value.
Recognised financial assets and financial liabilities in fair value hedges are adjusted for changes in fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged.
The accounting policies that are applicable to the company are included in RBS accounting polices which are set out on pages 297 to 313 of the consolidated financial statements, except that it has no policy regarding Basis of consolidation and that the companys investments in its subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment.
Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty The reported results of the company are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements.
The judgements and assumptions involved in the companys accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are those involved in assessing the impairment, if any, in its investments in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is any indication that its investment in a subsidiary is impaired.
If any such indication exists, the company undertakes an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary with its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an investment in a subsidiary is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgments: the choice of appropriate discount and growth rates: and the estimation of fair value.

7 Investments in Group undertakings Investments in Group undertakings are carried at cost less impairment.
Movements during the year were as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 52,129 54,858 Currency translation and other adjustments 31 48 Additional investments 50 Redemptions 1,446 Impairment of investments 6,106 2,827 At 31 December 44,608 52,129 396 Parent company financial statements and notes The majority of the impairment charge for 2016 and 2015 relates to the companys investment in RBS plc.
At 31 December 2016 and 2015 its carrying value exceeded its recoverable amount based on its value in use and an impairment of 6.0 billion 2015 - 2.8 billion was recognised.
At 31 December 2015 the effect of the impairment on the companys retained earnings was partially offset by the release of the balance on the merger reserve 2.3 billion which became a realised profit on writing down the companys investment in RBS plc.
The key assumptions applied in assessing the carrying value of the companys investment in The Royal Bank of Scotland plc are terminal growth rate of underlying business, the pre-tax discount rate and profit of future periods.
The underlying sensitivities in connection to the Groups reportable segments are disclosed in Note 15 on the consolidated accounts.
In respect of the investment in RBS plc, a 1% adverse movement in the discount rate would increase the impairment by 6.3 billion 2015 - 7.7 billion, a 1% adverse movement in the terminal growth rate value would increase the impairment by 2.9 billion 2015 - 3.8 billion and a 5% adverse movement in profit would increase the impairment by 2.7 billion 2015 - 3.6 billion.
