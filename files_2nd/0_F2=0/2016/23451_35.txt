These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares.
These operations are commonly known as Boiler Room scams.
Please be very wary of any such calls or correspondence.
Ask for the name and organisation of the person calling you and check if they can be found on the FCA Register.
If they are not listed, please report it directly to the FCA using their consumer helpline 0800 111 6768.
You may also wish to advise us by telephoning 020 7214 4200 or emailing ir@epiris.
It is very unlikely that either the Company or the Companys Registrars, Equiniti, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders.
Such calls would only relate to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never be in respect of investment advice.
Please remember that if you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong.
