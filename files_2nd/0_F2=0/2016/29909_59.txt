Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued is calculated from cash flow projections for generally five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each cash-generating unit.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates as shown above.
A resulting charge of 18m has been recognised for businesses included in the UK & ROI segment.
This charge has been classified as an exceptional item within Net restructuring and redundancy costs within cost of sales.
The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of each group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
An increase in the discount rate or reduction in the long-term growth rate by less than one percentage point would cause the carrying value of goodwill in the Malaysia 70m and Sociomantic 43m, included in UK above groups of cash-generating units to equal their recoverable values.
Impairment of software An impairment of 154m of software has been recognised in the year, principally as a result of an evaluation of the cash-generating unit for technology relating to online general merchandising as the Group moves toward a single online platform for customers.
In addition, assets with a total net carrying value of 98m were written off within disposals.
These amounts have been reflected as Net impairment of PPE, intangible assets and onerous lease provisions within exceptional items in cost of sales.
The other amounts have not been classified as exceptional items.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each store is a cash-generating unit.
Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal.
Fair values for the Groups properties were determined with the assistance of independent, professional valuers where appropriate.
The net carrying value of 17,900m 2015: 20,440m above comprises 13,731m 2015: 13,642m of unimpaired assets and 4,169m 2015: 6,798m of impaired assets.
Of the impaired assets, 1,805m 2015: 3,841m carrying value was supported by value in use and 2,364m 2015: 2,957m was supported by fair value.
Due to the individual nature of each property, these fair values are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values are determined in regard to the market rent for the stores or for alternative uses with investment yields appropriate to reflect the physical characteristics of the property, location, infrastructure, redevelopment potential and other factors.
In some cases, fair values include residual valuations where stores may be viable for redevelopment.
The key inputs to the valuation are the potential market rents and yields, both of which are largely based on rentals and yields for similar properties in that location.
Value in use is generally calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecast, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of 2% to 6% 2015: 2% to 5%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use predominately range from 9% to 12% 2015: 9% to 12% depending on the specific conditions in which each cash-generating unit operates.
On a post-tax basis, the discount rates predominately range from 7% to 9% 2015: 7% to 10%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
A net impairment loss of 18m 263m loss offset by 245m reversal has been recognised in the year, largely reflecting normal fluctuations expected from store level performance within the continuing challenging economic environment.
These losses and reversals have been largely presented net at an operating segment level to reflect the underlying trends in the businesses.
The impairment loss of 263m 2015: 4,118m relates to properties in the UK & ROI of 164m 2015: 3,484m and International of 99m 2015: 634m, whilst the impairment reversal of 245m 2015: 176m relates to properties in the UK & ROI of 126m 2015: 133m and International of 119m 2015: 43m.
Of the 18m net loss, a 93m release within exceptional items related to trading stores and online general merchandising hardware has been classified as Net impairment of PPE, intangible assets and onerous lease provisions included within cost of sales.
In addition, an 89m loss within exceptional items related to construction in progress and closed stores has been classified as Net impairment of PPE, intangible assets and onerous lease provisions included within profits losses arising on property-related items.
An additional 34m loss within exceptional items relating to business rationalisation in the UK & ROI has been classified as Net restructuring and redundancy costs included within cost of sales.
The remaining 12m reversal has not been included within exceptional items.
