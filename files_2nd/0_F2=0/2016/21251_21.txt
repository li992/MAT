c Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which the Group believes should be separately identified on the face of the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group.
Determining whether an item is part of underlying items or non-underlying items requires judgement.
A total non-underlying loss after tax of 24m 2015: 71m was charged to the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Refer to Note 10. d Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the application of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
A nominal growth rate, based on real GDP growth plus CPI inflation, is used to calculate a terminal growth multiple in accordance with the Gordon Growth Model.
The discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the specific economic environment of the relevant cash-generating unit.
The carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2016 was 937m 2015: 844m.
Refer to Note 14. e Available-for-sale financial assets At 31 December 2016, 2,292m 2015: 2,638m of PPP financial assets constructed by the Groups subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies were classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
In the operational phase the fair value of these financial assets is measured at each reporting date by discounting the future value of the cash flows allocated to the financial asset.
A range of discount rates is used from 2.3% to 8.3% 2015: 3.61% to 5.10%, which reflects the prevailing risk-free interest rates and the different risk profiles of the various concessions.

This segment also includes the Groups housing development division.
The Group has continued to present the remaining parts of Rail Germany outside of underlying items as it remains committed to exiting its Mainland European rail businesses as soon as possible and does not consider its operations part of the Groups underlying activity.
Following the various disposals of parts of Rail Germany in 2015 and 2016, the Group is winding down its remaining operations in Rail Germany with the last remaining contract expected to reach completion in 2018.
In 2014, the performance of external Engineering Services ES contracts linked to poor legacy management and in regions that ES has withdrawn from tendering for third-party work was included in non-underlying items as the size and nature of the losses due to the problematic delivery of these contracts are exceptional and distort the underlying performance of the Group.
The Group continues to present the results from these legacy contracts within non-underlying and will continue to do so until these contracts reach completion, inclusive of any claims recovery.
Separate disclosure of these contracts aids the readers understanding of the underlying performance of the remainder of the Group.

2 The Group has continued to present the results of certain external legacy Engineering Services ES contracts in non-underlying items.
These contracts were classified as non-underlying items in 2014 as the performance of these contracts was linked to poor legacy management and in regions where ES has withdrawn from tendering for third-party work.
These contracts resulted in alossbefore tax for the Group of 6m in 2016 2015: 8m.
No tax credit has been recognised on this loss.

4.2 In 2016, potential liabilities on historical health and safety breaches were reassessed following new sentencing guidelines introduced and the settlement of other historical claims previously treated as non-underlying items.
As a result of this, the Group has revised its legal provisioning levels relating to these items, recognising an expense of 25m.
This has been presented as non-underlying because its size would otherwise distort the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and the events giving rise to these expenses occurred in prior years.
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services 13m and Support Services 12m.
4.3 In 2016, the Group has released all remaining provisions relating to Trans4m Ltd Trans4m amounting to 9m, 1m of which has been recognised at the joint venture level.

The entire charge was recognised within Construction Services.
4.5 In 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners, comprising its 17.8% interest in the Infrastructure Fund and 100% interest in the funds advisor.

4.7 On 27 May 2015, the Group disposed of its 50% interest in Signalling Solutions Ltd SSL for a cash consideration of 18m, resulting in a 16m gain in 2015.
In 2016, additional consideration received resulted in a further gain of 2m being reported.
In addition to this, a 1m pension settlement gain arose as a result of transferring pension liabilities relating to the employees of SSL to the new employer.
This gain was recognised within Construction Services.
4.8 In September 2016, the Group completed the disposal of parts of Rail Germany to Tianjin Keyvia Electric Co Ltd for a cash consideration of 15m.

In 2015, additional restructuring costs of 5m were incurred in Rail Germany relating to the restructuring of overheads post completion of disposal of parts of the business.
These restructuring costs comprise redundancy costs of 1m and other restructuring costs of 4m.
Both Heery and Rail Germany are included within the Construction Services segment.
4.11 In 2015, transitioning other operating companies to the UK shared service centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and increasing the scope led to incremental costs of 8m.
4.12 In 2015, an impairment charge of 17m was recorded to write down intangible assets in relation to costs capitalised in the transformation of the Groups UK IT estate from a federated to a more centralised model.
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services 9m: Support Services 7m: and Corporate 1m.
5.2 In 2016, the joint venture within Rail Germany generated a trading gain of nil for the Group 2015: 1m gain.
In addition to this, in 2015, a4m impairment charge was recognised on the joint venture following an agreement to sell parts of Rail Germany toTianjin Keyvia Electric Co Ltd.
6 The non-underlying items charged against Group operating profit from continuing operations gave rise to a tax credit of 4m comprising: 3m tax credit on amortisation of acquired intangible assets: 3m charge on the results of Rail Germany: and 4m credit on other non-underlying items 2015: 4m comprising: 2m charge on the results of Rail Germany: 4m credit on amortisation of acquired intangible assets: and 2m credit on other non-underlying items.

1.1 In 2015, the Group finalised the cash consideration due on the disposal of Parsons Brinckerhoff PB amounting to additional consideration for the Group of 16m of which 7m was recognised as a receivable at the date of disposal in the prior period.
In accordance with the stock purchase agreement, the Group received cash of 20m relating to historical tax matters 16m of which was recognised as a current tax receivable in the prior period and the Group also released an indemnity provision relating to an historical legal claim of 3m which was successfully settled during the period.
Offsetting this additional non-underlying gain on disposal were separation costs incurred during the period of 4m, of which 2m were paid during the period, and the write-off of a deferred tax asset of 7m resulting in an overall net gain of5m.
Transaction costs of 9m, which were accrued in the prior period, were paid in the year.
Subsequently in 2016, the Group reached a settlement with the purchaser of PB in relation to outstanding tax matters and indemnities.
The Group received an additional 9m as a result of this settlement.
At the same time, provisions in relation to these matters have been released, resulting in an overall gain to the Group of 24m.

com AR2016 128 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Income taxes continued 11.1 Income tax expense continued The UK Government has confirmed its intention to introduce restrictions on the utilisation of brought forward tax losses from 1 April 2017.
This legislation has not yet been substantively enacted and hence has not been taken into account in assessing the recognition of UK deferred tax assets at 31 December 2016.
Pending finalisation of this legislation, its impact on both tax expense and cash tax payable in future periods will continue to be assessed.

The Board took the decision to suspend the dividend in 2015, to ensure balance sheet strength was maintained during the initial stages of Build to Last.
Following the demonstrable progress made by the Group in the first year of the transformation programme and in the expectation of further solid and measurable improvements, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.8p, following the interim dividend declared at the half year of 0.9p.
The Board continues to anticipate a progressive dividend policy going forward.
The interim 2016 dividend was paid on 2 December 2016.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2017, the final 2016 dividend will be paid on 7 July 2017 to holders on the register on 21 April 2017 by direct credit or, where no mandate has been given, by cheque posted on 6 July 2017 payable on 7 July 2017.

The Groups cash flow forecasts are based on the expected workload of each cash-generating unit CGU, giving consideration to the current level of confirmed and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Groups Three Year Plan, which covers the period from 2017 to 2019 and includes the stabilisation and recovery of the Construction Services UK business to more normal levels of performance.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU were compiled from each of its constituent business units as part of the Groups annual financial planning process.
Whilst it is anticipated that growth will remain stable in the UK buildings sector, tender margins will improve as there will be an increased selectivity to drive a higher quality project portfolio.
The Group is well positioned in the UK infrastructure market for major schemes and regulatory spending uplift.
It isanticipated that the US construction market will continue to improve, as will tender margins which will also be driven by increased selectivity of projects.
In the Support Services segment, market conditions are anticipated to be stable in the UK.
The Support Services business has a portfolio of long-term contracts and has secured the majority of its workload for the forecast period.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its long-term growth rate and discount rate.
The discount rates have been calculated usingthe Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC method, which takes account of the Groups capital structure financial risk as well asthe nature of each CGUs business operational risk.
Long-term growth rates are assumed to be the estimated future GDP growth rates based on published independent forecasts for the country or countries in which each CGU operates, less 1.0% to reflect current economic uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure.
In the derivation of each CGUs value-in-use, a terminal value is assumed based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The multiple is applied to a terminal cash flow, which is the normalised cash flow in the last year of the forecast period.
The EBIT multiple iscalculated using the Gordon Growth Model and is a factor of the discount rate and growth rate for each CGU.
The nominal terminal value is discounted to present value.

The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.
Using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.6% and nominal long-term growth rate of 3.4% the recoverable amount of the remaining goodwill in Balfour Beatty Construction Group Inc. is 594m based on value-in-use, with consequent headroom of 142m.
A 1.0% increase in the discount rate and a 1.0% reduction in the growth rate would lead to an impairment of 41m.
Except as noted above, a reasonable possible change in key assumptions will not give rise to an impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
In light of the significant, albeit reduced, losses incurred within the construction business in 2016 the Group has considered whether a reasonable possible change in assumptions would lead to an impairment of the goodwill in the related CGUs and concluded that it is not the case.
The stabilisation and recovery of the Groups Construction Services UK business to more normal levels of performance is however a key assumption underpinning the cash flow forecasts used to assess the recoverable amount of the related goodwill.

The project to design, build and maintain postgraduate accommodation at the University of Edinburgh is nearing completion of the construction phase, with the first rooms occupied by students from September 2015.
Additional spend of 6m 2015: 23m was incurred in the year in respect of this project.
In 2015, an impairment charge of 17m was recognised against software intangible assets relating to costs capitalised in the transformation of the Groups UK IT estate from a federated to a more centralised model.
Due to curtailments in the scope of the implementation and the Groups termination of its agreement with its implementation partner, future benefits expected to be generated from this asset arereduced.
The impairment was recognised as a non-underlying charge.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are one to four years for customer contracts, three to 10 years for customer relationships, three to seven years for software, and up to five years for brand names, except for customer contracts and relationships relating to Balfour Beatty Investments North America which are amortised on a basis matching the returns earned over the life of the underlying contracts and relationships.
These contracts have a duration of up to 50 years for customer contracts relating to  North America.
The Infrastructure Investments intangible is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the project which is 50 years.
Software assets recognised in the UK are amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its seven-year life.
The Groups remaining knowledge sharing and collaboration software is amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its five-year life.
Other intangible assets are amortised over periods up to 10 years.

These assets meet the definition of investment properties and have been reclassified as such.
Infrastructure leasehold improvements comprise student accommodation projects in Iowa and Reno.
The Group commenced construction of Phase 2 of the student accommodation project in Iowa in 2015 resulting in capital expenditure of 14m in the year 2015: 9m.
Construction on this phase was completed in 2016 and was therefore transferred out of assets in the course of construction to be classified within infrastructure leasehold improvements.
All buildings are held under short leaseholds and are depreciated over 40 years.
The carrying amount of the Groups plant and equipment held under finance leases was 1m 2015: 1m.
The Company has no property, plant and equipment held under finance leases.
Except for land and assets in the course of construction, the costs of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum or over the term of the lease, and plant and equipment is depreciated at 4% to 33% per annum.

Investment properties are held by the Group to generate rental income and capital appreciation.
The Group has chosen to account for its investment property assets under the cost method.
For one of its investment properties, the Group has secured non-recourse project specific financing amounting to 18m 2015: nil.
This financing is secured through a floating charge over the property.
In 2015, the amounts held as investment properties solely related to the purchase of land on which construction has commenced in 2016.
All of the additions disclosed in the table above relate to capital expenditure on these properties which are in the course of construction and are not yet operational.
No depreciation is charged on investment properties that are in the course of construction.

The principal joint ventures and associates are shown in Note 39.
The amount of the Groups share of borrowings of joint ventures and associates which was supported by the Group and the Company was 17m 2015: 20m, relating to the Groups share of guaranteed borrowings.
The non-recourse borrowings of joint venture and associate entities relating to infrastructure concessions projects are repayable over periods extending up to 2044.
The non-recourse borrowings arise under facilities taken out by project-specific joint venture and associate concession companies.
The borrowings of each concession company are secured by a combination of fixed and floating charges over that concession companys interests in its projects assets and revenues and the shares in the concession company held by its immediate parent company.
A significant part of these loans has been swapped into fixed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps.
As disclosed in Note 39 f, the Group has committed to provide its share of further equity funding of joint ventures and associates in Infrastructure Investments projects and military housing concessions.
Further, in respect of a number of these investments the Group has committed not to dispose of its equity interest until construction is complete.
As is customary in such projects, banking covenants restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions.
# The Group has recognised losses in relation to Dutco in excess of the carrying value of its investment as the Group has constructive obligations to provide further funding to make good these losses.
At 31 December 2016, these losses amounted to 12m 2015: 9m andhave been classified as other provisions.
# As detailed in Note 37, on 26 January 2017 the Group reached agreement to sell its 49% interests in Dutco to its joint venture partner.

The Groups investment in military housing joint ventures and associates projects is recognised at its remaining equity investment plus the value of the Groups accrued returns from the underlying projects.
The military housing joint ventures and associates have total non-recourse net borrowings of 2,710m 2015: 2,249m.
Note 39 e details the Groups military housing projects.
On certain Infrastructure Investments concessions where net fair value revaluations of PPP financial assets and cash flow hedges resulted in the Groups carrying value of these investments being negative, the Group has not recognised losses beyond the carrying value of its investments.
This is because the Group has not committed to provide any further funding to these investments and the borrowings within these concessions are non-recourse to the Group.
At 31 December 2016, the unrecognised cumulative net fair value charges to other comprehensive income amounted to 19m 2015: 24m.

6m 2015: 11m will expire between five and 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2017.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets for UK corporation tax trading losses of 4m 2015: 14m.
The Group has UK corporation tax trading losses of 768m 2015: 709m which are not recognised as deferred tax assets.
The Group also had unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to retirement benefits of 108m 2015: nil.
At the reporting date the undistributed reserves for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised were 1m 2015: 1m in respect of subsidiaries and nil 2015: nil in respect of joint ventures and associates.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Groups control and no distribution which gives rise to taxation is contemplated.

Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligation is to provide specified benefits on retirement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 prescribes the accounting for defined benefit schemes in the Groups financial statements.
Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on high-quality corporate bonds.
The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net finance cost arising from the expected interest income on plan assets and interest cost on scheme obligations is included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The IAS 19 accounting valuations are set out in Note 28.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds as required by IAS 19 for the financial statements.
Details of the latest formal triennial funding valuations are set out in Note 28.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets of, the Group.
Principal schemes The Groups principal schemes are the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined contribution and defined benefit sections, and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The defined benefit sections of both schemes are funded and closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has transferred to the Group under certain agreed arrangements.
Pension benefits are based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the trust deed and rules and relevant legislation.
Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufficient assets to meet the cost of current and future benefits.
These schemes expose the Group to investment and actuarial risks where additional contributions may be required if assets are not sufficient to pay future pension benefits: investment risk: equity returns are a key determinant of investment return but the investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the investments held, for example, credit risk on corporate bond holdings.
actuarial risk: the ultimate cost of providing pension benefits is affected by inflation rates and members life expectancy.
The net present value of the obligations is affected by the market yield on high-quality corporate bonds used to discount the obligations.
Changes in the principal actuarial assumptions based on market data, such as inflation and the discount rate, and experience, such as life expectancy, expose the Group to fluctuations in the net IAS 19 liability and the net finance cost.
com AR2016 150 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities continued 28.1 Introduction continued Balfour Beatty Pension Fund The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth.
The BBPF invests partly in a diversified range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the obligations.
The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market and emerging market equities.
The remaining BBPF assets are principally fixed and index-linked bonds and derivatives, providing protection against movements in inflation and interest rates and hence enhancing the resilience of the funding level of the scheme.
The performance of the assets is measured against market indices.
Since 2014, the Group has been offering a commutation option for pensioner members and dependants with benefits with a value of less than 30,000 and 18,000, respectively, to extinguish their benefits within the BBPF in exchange for a cash lump sum.
The acceptance of this offer by certain members and dependants gave rise to a settlement event resulting in a decrease inliabilities of 1m 2015: 3m, which was recognised in other non-underlying items.
Following the scheme apportionment arrangement made in relation to the disposal of Balfour Beatty WorkPlace, agreement was reached with the trustees on 24 September 2014 to make additional deficit payments totalling 15m in 2015.
On 1 July 2015, the Group established a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP structure into which its investment in Consort Healthcare Birmingham Holdings Ltd Consort Birmingham, which owns the Groups 40% interest in the Birmingham Hospital PFI investment, was transferred.
The BBPF is a partner in the SLP and is entitled to a share of the income of the SLP.
In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the SLP is deemed to be controlled by the Group, which retains the ability to substitute the investment in Consort Birmingham for other investments from time to time.
On 29 December 2016 the Group transferred into the SLP its investment in Holyrood Student Accommodation Holdings Ltd, which owns the Groups 100% interest in the Edinburgh student accommodation project.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the BBPF in the SLP does not constitute a plan asset and therefore the pension deficit presented in these financial statements does not reflect the BBPFs interest in the SLP.
Distributions from the SLP to the BBPF will be reflected in the Groups financial statements as pension contributions on a cash basis.
The first distribution was received in December 2015 and amounted to 1m.
A further distribution was received in 2016 and amounted to 1m.
Alongside the establishment of the SLP, agreement was reached to make a series of deficit payments to the BBPF with the first payment of 4m paid in 2016.
A formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016.
As a result, the Group agreed to make ongoing deficit payments in addition to those set out above of 5m for the period from January 2017 to April 2017: 17m per annum from April 2017: 19m per annum from April 2018: and 3m per annum from April 2020.
If the dividend cover ratio is below an agreed trigger level then the contributions set out above may need to be accelerated.
This agreement constitutes a minimum funding requirement MFR under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The Group has not recognised any liabilities in relation to this MFR as any surplus of deficit contributions to the BBPF would be recoverable by way of a refund and the Group has the unconditional right to the surplus and controls the run-off of the benefit obligations once all other obligations of the BBPF have been settled.
Implementation of the draft Amendment to IFRIC 14 when it becomes effective will not affect this accounting.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 151 28 Retirement benefit liabilities continued 28.1 Introduction continued Railways Pension Scheme The RPS is a shared cost scheme.
The legal responsibility of the Group in the RPS is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
In 2013 and previous years, the assumed cost of providing benefits was split between the Group and the members in the ratio 60:40.
This had been a reasonable assumption to make of how costs might have been shared over the long term.
This assumption has been retained in relation to the cost of providing future service benefits.
Since 2014, because of a declining population of active members, it became less likely that the Groups costs of meeting any deficits would be capped in line with its strict legal obligation of 60%.
It was anticipated that members might only be able to afford to fund a small proportion of the scheme deficit.
In the accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the long-term cost of providing past service benefits was assumed to be split between the Group and the members in the ratio 95:5.
For the year ended 31 December 2016 it has been assumed that the Group will be responsible for 100% of any deficit and the balance sheet assets and obligations disclosed, therefore, are equal to 100% of the total scheme assets and obligations.
The RPS invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and income and, as determined by the trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the trustees attitude to risk.
The majority of the RPS assets that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled growth fund.
This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time.
The remaining assets in the RPS are principally fixed and index-linked bonds.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation carried out as at 31 December 2013, the Group agreed to make ongoing fixed deficit contributions of 6m per annum which should reduce the deficit to zero by 2031.
This agreement constitutes a MFR under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The Group has not recognised any liabilities in relation to this MFR as any surplus of deficit contributions to the RPS would be recoverable by way of a refund and the Group has the unconditional right to the surplus and controls the run-off of the benefit obligations once all other obligations of the RPS have been settled.
The triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2016 is now underway.
Other schemes Other schemes comprise unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe, the majority of which are closed to new entrants, and deferred compensation schemes in North America, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 19.1 in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate benefit of the employees but are available to the Groups creditors in the event of insolvency.

The BBPF actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and due to the size of the membership of the BBPF 44,322 members at 31 December 2016 is able to make comparisons of this experience with the mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables.
The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
This research is taken into account in the Groups mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes.

Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income but each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
29.2 Cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1p each Issued Million m At 31 December 2015 and 2016 112 1 All issued preference shares are fully paid.
During the current and prior year, no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by the Company.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half-yearly.
A preference dividend of 5.375p per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share of 1p was paid on 1 July 2016 in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2016.
A preference dividend of 5.375p per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share of 1p was paid on 1 January 2017 in respect of the six months ended 31 December 2016.
On 1 July 2020, any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 112m at 31 December 2016 2015: 112m.
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares ifthere are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30-day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference shares or a resolution for the winding up of the Company.
On winding up the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of 1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are a compound instrument, comprising equity and liability components.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% per annum for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to theliability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders equity, net of deferred tax.

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 167 37 Events after the reporting date On 26 January 2017, the Group reached agreement to sell its 49% interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC and BK Gulf LLC to its joint venture partner for a total cash consideration of 11m.
The sale subsequently completed on 1 March 2017.
The Groups investment in these entities did not satisfy the criteria under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations at the balance sheet date and therefore continued to be presented within the Groups underlying continuing operations.
Following the agreement to sell in January 2017, the criteria under IFRS 5 are now satisfied and therefore the Groups share of results in these entities will be presented as part of its discontinued operations with comparatives restated accordingly in its 2017 financial statements.
The impact of the disposal will be presented as non-underlying within discontinued operations.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, forspeculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability in non-recourse project finance loans arising from variable interest rates on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks since 2015. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, euros, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirates dirhams.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Whenever acurrent or future foreign currency exposure is identified with sufficient reliability Group Treasury enters into forward contracts onbehalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial Officer.
Refer to page 168 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures.
As at 31 December 2016, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 70m 2015: 35m receivable and 71m 2015: 36m payable with related cash flows expected to occur in up to two 2015: two years.
The foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from fair valuing these unhedged foreign exchange contracts will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of 10m 2015: nil receivable and 11m 2015: nil payable as cash flow hedges against highly probable cash flows which are expected to occur in up to five 2015: one years.
Fair value gains on these contracts of 2m 2015: nil have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive income.
The cumulative amount deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at the reporting date is 2m 2015: nil.
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any foreign exchange cash flow hedges.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks.
The Group does not enter into forward foreign exchange or other derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets.
In March 2013, the Group raised US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge against changes in the value of the Groups US net assets due to exchange movements.
The Group has reassessed this hedge and has concluded that the hedge continues to be effective.
Exchange movements in the year totalled 49m 2015: 12m.
A 5% increase decrease in the US dollar to sterling exchange rate would lead to a 14m decrease 2015: 11m 15m increase 2015: 12m in the carrying amount of the liability on the Groups balance sheet, with the movement recognised in other comprehensive income.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 7m increase 2015: 20m 9m decrease 2015: 24m in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
At the reporting date there had been no change to the hedging policies since 2015. balfourbeatty.
com AR2016 170 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 38 Financial instruments continued ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups non-recourse project companies which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold available-for-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy to manage this risk is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swap contracts.
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would be immaterial.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curve at the reporting date.
During 2016 and 2015, the Groups non-recourse project subsidiaries borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling and US dollars.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2016 totalled 117m 2015: 304m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 23 years.
At 31 December 2015, the fixed interest rates range from 3.5% to 5.1% 2015: 3.5% to 5.1% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR plus afixed margin.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 7m increase 2015: 20m 9m decrease 2015: 24m in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group in relation to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and other borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a nil decrease 2015: 2m nil increase 2015: 1m in the Groups net finance cost.
iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its Infrastructure Investments concessions.
At the commencement of the concession, an element of the unitary payment by the customer is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
The Group is exposed to price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and deposits, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments, the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are independently rated with a minimum long-term credit rating of BBB.
At 31 December 2016, 1m 2015: 5m did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board of Directors for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables, credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Groups most significant customers are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at the reporting date is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 26.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out on page 168.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 171 38 Financial instruments continued Fair value estimation The Group holds certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability in accordance with the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.
Level 1 The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group  investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price atthe reporting date.
Level 2 The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, eitherdirectly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising yield curves at the reporting date and taking into account own credit risk.
Own credit risk for Infrastructure Investments swaps is not material and is calculated using the following credit valuation adjustment CVA calculation: loss given default multiplied by exposure multiplied by probability of default.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Own credit risk for the other derivative liabilities is not material and is calculated by applying a relevant credit default swap CDS rate obtained from a third party.
Level 3 The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Groups PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin by reference to the construction margin on non-PPP projects reflecting the construction risks retained by the construction contractor, and fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets, with marketrelated movements in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and other movements recognised in the income statement.
Amounts originally recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement upon disposal of the asset.
A change in the discount rate would have a significant effect on the value of the asset and a 50 basis point increase decrease, which represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in the risk-adjusted discount rate, would lead to a 7m decrease 2015: 14m 7m increase 2015: 15m in the fair value of the assets taken through equity.
Refer to Note 20 for a reconciliation of the movement from the opening balance to the closing balance.

Due to delays in achieving planning, UBB Waste Gloucestershire Ltd reached a second financial close in January 2016. e Balfour Beatty Investments North America Military housing Summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number of US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 55 US government military bases which includes 55 military family housing communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 42,800 housing units once development, construction and renovation are complete.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, seven projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project with the Army at Fort Stewart.
Contractual arrangements The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, could potentially extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50-year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCsleasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual minimum preferred rate of return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.

On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to 18% depending on the particular project and the type of return annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions will have the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds willtypically be distributed to the applicable military service.

ii The share of results of the military housing joint ventures of Balfour Beatty Communities is limited to a pre-agreed preferred return on funds invested.
The Group evaluated each of its interests in the military housing projects to determine if the entities should be consolidated.
This analysis included, but was not limited to, identifying the activities that most significantly impact an entitys economic performance, which party or parties control those activities and the risks associated with these entities.
Decision making power over key facets of the contracts were evaluated when determining which party or parties had control over the activities that most significantly impacted a projects economics.
Based on this review, the Directors consider that the Group does not have the power to direct these activities and does not have control and therefore the Group does not consolidate the military housing projects.
