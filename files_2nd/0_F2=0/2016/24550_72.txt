NOTE 4 Investments In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the Company discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure the fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurements.
The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows: Level 1 Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active: Level 3 Inputs that are unobservable.
Generally, the majority of the Companys investments are valued utilising unobservable inputs, and are therefore classified within Level 3.
93 Level 3 partnership investments include limited partnership interests in other investment partnerships.
For investments in limited partnerships and other pooled investment vehicles, the Company encourages all managers to apply fair value principles in their financial reports that are consistent with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Inputs used to determine fair value include financial statements provided by the investment partnerships which typically include fair market value capital account balances.
In reviewing the underlying financial statements and capital account balances, the Company considers compliance with authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, the currency in which the investment is denominated, and other information deemed appropriate.
If the Company shall in good faith determine that a manager is not reporting fair value consistent with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company shall use best efforts to undertake its own valuation analysis using fair market value principles and adjust such value so it is in accordance with the authoritative guidance.
Income derived from investments in partnerships is recorded using the equity pick-up method.
Because of the inherent uncertainty of these valuations, the estimated fair value may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a ready market for this security existed, and the difference could be material.
The following table summarises the Companys investments that were accounted for at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy: LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL BALANCE AT 31 JANUARY 2014 $5,876,942 $1,258,367,826 $1,264,244,768 Contributions to investments 162,192,314 162,192,314 Net realised gain loss on investments 221,599 163,412,861 163,634,460 Net change in unrealised appreciation 171,205 35,510,878 35,682,083 depreciation on investments Distributions received from investments 5,927,336 349,522,993 355,450,329 BALANCE AT 31 JANUARY 2015 $ $1,198,939,130 $1,198,939,130 Contributions to investments 210,944,628 210,944,628 Net realised gain loss on investments 160,006,292 160,006,292 Net change in unrealised appreciation 77,921,988 77,921,988 depreciation on investments Distributions received from investments 362,480,519 362,480,519 BALANCE AT 31 JANUARY 2016 $ $1,129,487,543 $1,129,487,543 Net change in unrealised gain loss on $77,921,988 investments related to investments still held at 31 January 2016 The Company recognises transfers at the current value at the transfer date.
