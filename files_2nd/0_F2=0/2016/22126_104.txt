34 Group composition and non-controlling interests The Groups subsidiaries are listed in note 8 and note 18 of the parent company financial statements on pages 177 and 181188.
This includes AXELOS Limited and Entrust Limited which both have 49% non-controlling interests, and FERA which has a 25% non-controlling interest, none of whose contribution was material to the Groups financial performance, financial position or cash ow in both 2016 and 2015.
The Group holds a majority of the voting rights in all of these subsidiaries and the Directors have determined that, other than the entity commented on below, in each case the Group exercises fide facto control.
On 23 September 2014, the Secretary of State for the Department for Energy and Climate Change granted Smart DCC Ltd DCC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, a licence to establish and manage the smart metering communications infrastructure, governed by the Smart Energy Code.
Each year the Group reassess whether it has control over DCC as required under IFRS 10.
The Groups ability to control the relevant activities of DCC is restricted by DCCs operating licence.
The power that the Group has over DCCs relevant activities by virtue of owning it is limited given the restrictions in the license.
That power is held by the board of DCC where the Group has minority representation in compliance with the licence.
The Group has therefore not consolidated DCC within its Group accounts.
The disclosure of related party transactions with DCC is included in note 33 to these financial statements.
35 Post balance sheet event No post balance sheet events are noted.
