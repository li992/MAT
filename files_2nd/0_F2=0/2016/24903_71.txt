104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS a Overview of all retirement benefit arrangements Defined contribution: auto-enrolment plan The Group operates an auto-enrolment defined contribution plan for employees, in line with recent UK Government legislation.
Under the terms of this scheme, employees make pension contributions out of their salaries, and the Group also makes additional contributions.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this plan in the current period of 4.1m 2015: 3.3m represents the Groups contributions due and payable in respect of the period.
Due to the timing of payments, 0.4m 2015: 0.2m of this amount was unpaid at the period end, but was paid shortly afterwards.
Defined contribution: other plan The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.
The assets of this plan are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This plan began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this plan in the current period of 0.8m 2015: 0.9m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plan Characteristics and risks of the plan The Group operates a funded pension plan which provides benefits based on the career average pensionable pay of participating employees.
This plan was closed to new entrants from April 2013.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Group, being held in a trustee-administered pension plan and invested with independent fund managers.
The trustee directors of the plan comprise three member-elected trustees, two independent trustees, and three Group-appointed trustees.
All trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plan beneficiaries.
The plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, and market investment risk.
Accounting and actuarial valuation Contributions are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2014 by the plan actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward the results of the 5 April 2014 valuation to 24 December 2016, and has restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.
Funding and estimated contributions The Group has an agreement with the pension plan trustees to make additional deficit contributions to the plan over and above the normal level of contributions of 35m per year until 30 June 2017, and then 25m per year until 30 June 2018.
The Groups estimated total cash contributions to the defined benefit plan in the 53 weeks ending 30 December 2017 are 43.5m.
Differences between the defined benefit pension deficit on an IAS 19 basis and on a funding basis As is mandatory under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group values its pension deficit in these accounts on an IAS 19 basis.
As shown below, the IAS 19 deficit at the current period end is 106m.
On a funding basis also known as a Technical Provisions basis, being the basis on which the triennial actuarial valuations are carried out, the funding deficit at the current period end is estimated at 236m, this estimate being based on an approximate roll-forward of the 2014 triennial funding valuation, updated for market conditions.
French post-employment benefits We recognised a provision in 2014 for a post-employment benefit which is payable to employees in our French subsidiaries under French law on retirement.
It is a lump sum payable on retirement, not a recurring pension.
As such, there is no underlying pension plan.
In 2016 this liability had grown from 0.2m to 0.3m, and we recognised an additional 0.1m.

An increase of 0.25% to the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by around 2.5%, or 32m, and would increase total service cost by around 0.3m.
The effect of increasing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 2% or 26m, and would increase total service cost by around 0.4m.
The sensitivities above are applied to the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period, and the projected total service cost for 2017.
Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.
