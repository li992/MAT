com Stock Code: PLP STRA OUR FINANCIALS TEGIC REPORT NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 1.
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on the 30 March 2017 and the balance sheet was signed on the Boards behalf by M K Payne.
Polypipe Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The principal activity of the Group is the manufacture of plastic pipe systems for the building and construction market.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated historical financial information for the year ended 31 December 2016 are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects to all the periods presented.
2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRSs The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as endorsed by the European Union regulations as they apply to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million m unless otherwise indicated.
2.2 Going concern The Directors, having considered all relevant risk factors, believe the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
2.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2016.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: { Power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : { Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and { The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Groups accounting policies.
All inter-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
The Group holds 100% of the equity and controls 100% of the voting rights in all subsidiaries, with the exception of Water Management Solutions LLC which has not traded since incorporation in Qatar in 2015.
Accordingly, the treatment of noncontrolling interests or any other non-voting right factors in respect of control is not material.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.4 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is the total of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition fair value.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administration expenses in the income statement.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, is recognised in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
2.5 Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses see 2.12.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the profit or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
2.6 Foreign currency translation The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is also the parent companys functional currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured in that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
All differences arising on settlement or translation are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing.
The resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.7 Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been passed to the buyer when the goods are delivered.
The amount is recognised net of any discounts or rebates payable, which are accrued at the point at which the goods are delivered.
As explained in Note 3.2, rebates can be complex in nature and involve estimation.
Interest income Interest is recognised as interest accrues on cash balances using the effective interest method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its net carrying amount.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.8 Income taxes Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities based on income tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions: { where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: { in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and { deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
For deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries it must additionally be probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same tax authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the income tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on income tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
2.9 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on the cost less residual value of property, plant and equipment, and is on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings Over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years Plant and other equipment 4 to 10 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each financial year end and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any profit or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.10 Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are initially measured at cost.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially measured at fair value.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
Amortisation of intangible assets is provided over the following expected useful lives: Patents and brand names ten years Customer relationships five years Customer order book up to one year Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development expenditures on individual projects are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate: { The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale: { Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset: { How the asset will generate future economic benefits: { The availability of resources to complete the asset: and { The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
At the balance sheet date no development costs have met the above criteria.
2.11 Assets held for sale Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value, less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there are any indicators that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and it is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account.
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and industry forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Groups CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
These budgets and industry forecast calculations are generally covering a period of four years.
For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The following assets have specific characteristics for impairment testing: Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGUs.
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment losses related to goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
2.13 Leasing The classification of leases as finance or operating leases requires the Group to determine, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions, whether it retains or acquires the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these assets and accordingly whether the lease requires an asset and liability to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.14 Financial instruments i Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
Subsequent measurement The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
The Group does not hold any held-tomaturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.
This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in finance revenues or finance costs in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance revenues in the income statement.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
Loans and receivables also include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Derecognition A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised when: { The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: { The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
ii Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition.
The Group has trade and other payables, loans classified as loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Profits or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss.
Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Profits and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenues and finance costs.
Derecognition A liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the income statement.
iii Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED iv Fair values Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction in the principal or most advantageous market at the measurement date under current market conditions.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at the balance sheet date is determined by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions: reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same: discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 29. v Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 are recognised immediately in the income statement.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a noncurrent liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
vi Hedge accounting The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Note 29 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes.
The Group does not currently have any designated fair value hedges or net investment hedges.
Cash flow hedge Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flows of the derivative.
The effective part of any profit or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance with the policy for that financial instrument.
Any ineffective part of any profit or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative profit or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative profit or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
2.15 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, as follows: { Raw materials - purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis: { Work in progress and finished goods - cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.16 Cash and short-term deposits Cash and short-term deposits consist of cash at bank and in hand.
2.17 Pensions The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan.
Contributions payable in the year are charged to the income statement.
The assets are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.18 Non-underlying items The Group presents amortisation of intangible assets, profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment and non-recurring operating costs, financing charges and tax in respect of acquisitions as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement.
These are items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, the Directors consider merit separate presentation to provide a better and more consistent indication of the Groups underlying financial performance and more meaningful comparison with prior and future periods to assess trends in financial performance.
The tax effect of the above is also included.
2.19 Share-based payments In the case of equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The value of the options is measured using the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models, taking into account the terms and conditions including market and non-vesting conditions upon which the options were granted.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
2.20 Treasury shares The Group operates an employee benefit trust EBT.
The Group, and or the EBT, holds Polypipe Group plc shares for the granting of Polypipe Group plc shares to employees and Directors.
These treasury shares are recognised at cost and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
No profit or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
No dividends are earned on these shares.
The shares are ignored for the purposes of calculating the Groups earnings per share.
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The following judgements and estimates have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: 3.1 Impairment of non-financial assets In accordance with IFRS, the Group considers whether there are any indicators of impairment of assets.
Where indicators of impairment are identified, the Group tests the asset for impairment.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
The Groups impairment test for goodwill is based on a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model.
The cash flows are derived from the budget forecast for the next four years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the performance of the asset or the cash-generating unit CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs are further explained in Note 16.
com Stock Code: PLP STRA OUR FINANCIALS TEGIC REPORT 3.
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED 3.2 Revenue recognition and customer rebates The Groups pricing structure involves rebate arrangements with several of its direct and indirect customers.
These can be complex in nature and involve estimation in determining the required level of provision for rebate liabilities, particularly where the Group is reliant on information from customers which may not be available at the time the liabilities are assessed.
3.3 Measurement of intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves the estimation of future cash flows and other inputs relevant to the valuation model being applied.
Acquisitions are disclosed in Note 17.
3.4 Provisions against inventories The Directors make judgements based on experience regarding the level of provision required to state inventories at their net realisable value.
STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE Standards which have been adopted in the year There were no new standards or interpretations adopted in the year that had a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Standards issued but not yet effective The following listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expect to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance: but which have an effective date after the date of these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted them and plans to adopt them from the effective dates adopted by the European Union.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 None of these standards or interpretations are expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements with the exception of IFRS 16, Leases.
Under IFRS 16 the present distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed, resulting in all leases being recognised on the balance sheet except for those with a very low value.
At inception, a right-of-use asset will be recognised together with an equivalent liability reflecting the discounted lease payments over the estimated term of the lease.
Whilst the overall cost of using the asset over the lease term should be the same, it is likely that the weighting of the charge between periods may differ due to the requirement to distinguish between the lease and non-lease elements of the agreement.
Adoption of this standard is likely to result in an increase in gross assets and gross liabilities in the balance sheet, and finance costs being reclassified in the income statement.
Currently the Group does not have any finance leases but does have operating leases which are disclosed in Note 27.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.

SEGMENT INFORMATION IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Groups CODM is deemed to be the Board of Directors, who are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The Group has three reporting segments - Residential Systems all UK by origin, Commercial and Infrastructure Systems UK and Commercial and Infrastructure Systems Mainland Europe.
The reporting segments are organised based on the nature of the end markets served.
Our Middle East factory is included within Commercial and Infrastructure Systems UK due to the strong link with UK manufactured export product.
There are no significant judgements in aggregating operating segments to arrive at the reporting segments.
Inter-segment sales are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

INCOME TAX CONTINUED b Reconciliation of the total tax charge A reconciliation between the tax expense and the product of accounting profit multiplied by the UK standard rate of income tax for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Accounting profit before tax 54.4 41.5 Accounting profit multiplied by the UK standard rate of income tax of 20.0% 2015: 20.25% 10.9 8.4 Expenses not deductible for income tax 0.7 0.8 Non-taxable income 0.1 0.4 Share-based payments 0.3 Adjustments in respect of current income tax of previous years 0.8 Effects of patent box 0.7 0.4 Effects of other tax rates credits 0.3 0.2 Total tax expense reported in the income statement 10.2 7.4 The effective rate for the full year was 18.8% 2015: 17.8%.
If the impact of non-underlying costs is excluded, the underlying income tax rate would be 19.1% 2015: 19.2%.
c Deferred income tax The deferred income tax included in the Group balance sheet is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Deferred income tax liabilities Short-term timing differences 6.3 8.3 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 1.4 1.7 Share-based payments 0.4 7.3 10.0 The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if, and only if, it has a legally enforceable right to set off current income tax assets and current income tax liabilities and the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.
d Change in corporation tax rate The Chancellor has announced that the main UK corporation tax rate will be reduced from the current rate of 20%, which was applied from 1 April 2015, to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020.
The reduction in the corporation tax rate to 17% was included within the UK Finance Act 2016 that was enacted in September 2016.
Deferred income tax is measured at income tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on income tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax has therefore been provided at 17%.
e Unrecognised tax losses A deferred income tax asset of 1.0m 2015: 1.0m in respect of surplus non-trading losses of 5.5m 2015: 5.6m, has not been recognised at 31December 2016 as its recovery is uncertain.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following: Number of shares 2016 2015 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 198,930,384 199,267,136 Share options 1,053,339 540,243 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 199,983,723 199,807,379 Underlying earnings per share is based on the result for the year after tax, excluding the impact of non-underlying items, of 50.0m 2015: 38.8m.
The Directors consider that this measure provides a better and more consistent indication of the Groups underlying financial performance and more meaningful comparison with prior and future periods to assess trends in our financial performance.
The underlying earnings per share is calculated as follows: 2016 2015 Underlying profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent company m 50.0 38.8 Underlying basic earnings per share pence 25.1 19.5 Underlying diluted earnings per share pence 25.0 19.4 94 25092.04 13 April 2017 2:58 PM Proof 5 polypipe.

Impairment testing of goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to a number of cash-generating units CGUs.
These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs: CGU 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Building Products 146.1 146.1 Terrain 31.4 31.4 Civils 36.0 36.0 Nuaire 91.3 91.3 Others 24.5 24.5 329.3 329.3 Impairment tests on the carrying amounts of goodwill are performed by analysing the carrying amount allocated to each CGU against its value in use.
Value in use is calculated for each CGU as the net present value of that CGUs discounted future pre-tax cash flows.
These pre-tax cash flows are based on budgeted cash flows information for a period of one year, construction industry forecasts of growth for the following year and growth of between 2% to 3% thereafter 2015: 2% to 3%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% 2015: 10.7% has been applied in determining the recoverable amounts of CGUs.
The pre-tax discount rate is estimated based on the Groups risk adjusted cost of capital.
com Stock Code: PLP STRA OUR FINANCIALS TEGIC REPORT 16.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED The Group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonable possible changes in assumptions could cause an impairment that would be material to these consolidated financial statements.
In the case of Polypipe Frances goodwill of 9.6m 2015: 9.6m, included in others, this would be fully impaired if the revenue growth rate assumption from 2017 onwards of between 2.5% and 3.4% per annum, which is based on Euroconstruct and OECD forecasts, proved to be optimistic and revenue decline of between -1.5% and -2.4% per annum was achieved.
Polypipe Frances goodwill would also be fully impaired if the assumed revenue growth rates were achieved but the contribution margin fell by 320 bps due to competitive pressures.
Goodwill would also be impaired through a combination of these sensitivities.
The value in use of Polypipe France is calculated in Euros whereas the goodwill balance is denominated in Pounds Sterling.
Accordingly, any movement in the Pounds Sterling exchange rate versus Euros may, amongst other factors, impact the Polypipe France goodwill impairment test.

SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES CONTINUED Treasury shares Treasury shares represent the cost of Polypipe Group plc shares purchased in the market and held by the Company, and or the EBT, to satisfy the future exercise of options under the Groups share option schemes.
The market value of the shares at 31 December 2016 was 5.6m 2015: 2.5m.
The nominal value of each share is 0.001.

Hedging reserve The hedging reserve contains the effective portion of the cash flow hedge relationships entered into by the Group.
Foreign currency retranslation reserve The foreign currency retranslation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate capital structure to support its business objectives and maximise shareholder value.
The Group regards shareholders equity and net debt as its capital.
The Groups net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and derivative financial assets and liabilities.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had bank debt of 192.0m 2015: 217.5m, an undrawn committed revolving credit facility of 108.0m 2015: 82.5m and cash of 26.5m 2015: 21.6m.
A key objective of the Group is to maintain sufficient liquidity cash and committed bank facilities in order to meet its cash commitments including interest payments due on that debt.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED SAYE SAYE options were granted to eligible employees on 15 September 2016 at an exercise price of 2.21 per share, a 20% discount to the average share price over the three days preceding the offer.
Participating employees can exercise their options to purchase the shares acquired through their savings plans at the option price after three years.
These options have an exercise date of 2019 to 2020.
LTIP LTIPs were awarded to a number of senior executives on 10 May 2016 and 31 May 2016.
These options have an exercise date of 2019 to 2026.
The vesting of each award is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria of which 25% is based on total shareholder return the TSR element and 75% is based on earnings per share performance the EPS element.
Further details of the scheme are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Deferred share bonus plan On 26 April 2016, the Executive Directors received an award of shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan relating to the 2015 annual bonus.
Peter Shepherds deferred bonus share awards vested upon cessation of employment on 3 June 2016 in accordance with the Groups standard policy for good leavers, and were settled in cash.
Other share awards Other share awards in the form of nil cost options were made relating to buy-out arrangements to partially compensate the Chief Financial Officer for bonus and long-term incentive awards which were forfeited when he left his previous employer.
Further details are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
All these equity-settled, share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the date of grant of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimates of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Fair value for the SAYE options and the EPS element of the LTIPs is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
Fair value of the TSR element of the LTIPs is measured by use of a Monte Carlo model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CONTINUED Bank loan The bank loan, which is a revolving credit facility, is secured and expires in full in August 2020.
Interest is payable on the bank loan at LIBOR plus an interest margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.75% which is dependent on the Groups leverage net debt as a multiple of EBITDA and reduces as the Groups leverage reduces.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had available, subject to covenant headroom, 108.0m 2015: 82.5m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at 31 December 2016.
10m of the 300m revolving credit facility was reviewed at 31 December 2016 and the revolving credit facility was not reduced by 10m since the leverage ratio Net debt:EBITDA at 31 December 2016 was less than or equal to 2.25:1.
The facility will reduce by 10m each year, regardless of leverage, at 31 December 2017, 2018 and 2019: the remainder is available until August 2020.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its bank loan which, if breached, would result in the bank loan becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of EBITDA and interest cover.
At 31 December 2016 the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants.
The covenant position was as follows: Position at Covenant 31 December Covenant requirement 2016 Interest cover Underlying operating profit:Net finance costs excluding debt issue cost amortisation 4.00:1 9.7:1 Leverage Net debt:EBITDA 3.25:1 1.9:1 The interest cover covenant remains at 4.0:1 throughout the duration of the revolving credit facility.
The leverage covenant reduces to 3.0:1 at 30 September 2017 and remains at that level until August 2020.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES.
The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group has trade and other receivables and cash that are derived directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to interest rate cash flow, foreign currency exchange, credit and liquidity risk.
The Groups senior management oversees the mitigation of these risks which are summarised on the following page.
Interest rate cash flow risk The interest rate on the Groups 300m revolving credit facility is variable, being payable at LIBOR plus a margin.
To reduce the Groups exposure to future increases in interest rates the Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the following notional amounts, with interest payable at a fixed rate return dependant on the swap of either 2.21% or 1.735% 2015: 2.21% or 1.735% excluding margin : Notional Notional amount rate amount rate of 2.21% of 1.735% Year ended 31 December m m 2017 70.2 10.7 2018 66.6 25.1 2019 82.0 To August 2020 72.2 Foreign currency exchange risk Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument or future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Groups operating activities where the revenue or expense is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency rates primarily in respect of US Dollar and Euro receipts.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED Foreign currency exchange sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 10% change in the Euro exchange rate versus Pounds Sterling, the presentational currency of the Group used for translation purposes, on the net assets and profit after tax of the Group.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes for all other currencies is not material.
Effect on Effect on profit net assets after tax Change in exchange rate m m 2016 10% strengthening of Pounds Sterling: against Euro 1.4 0.1 10% weakening of Pounds Sterling: against Euro 1.8 0.1 2015 10% strengthening of Pounds Sterling: against Euro 1.1 10% weakening of Pounds Sterling: against Euro 1.4 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily for trade receivables and from its financing activities, including cash deposits with banks.
Trade receivables Customer credit risk is managed by each subsidiary subject to the Groups established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management.
Credit quality of the customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major export customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance.
The requirement for impairment is analysed at each balance sheet date on an individual basis for major clients.
Additionally, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively.
The calculation is based on actually incurred historical data.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets as disclosed in Note 21.
The Group does not hold collateral as security.
The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low.
At 31 December 2016, 75.3% 2015: 79.4% of net trade receivables were covered by credit insurance which is subject to the normal policy deductibles.
Financial instruments and cash deposits The Group maintains strong liquidity through cash balances and deposits 26.5m at 31December 2016 and its undrawn 108.0m committed revolving credit facility which matures in August 2020. Credit risk arising from cash deposits with banks is managed in accordance with the Groups established treasury policy, procedures and controls.
Deposits of surplus funds are made only with banks that have as a minimum a single A credit rating.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in Note 22.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group had cash and cash equivalents of 26.5m at 31 December 2016, 108.0m of undrawn and committed credit facilities and no debt maturities within twelve months.

Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value was determined using quoted forward exchange rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The fair values disclosed above all relate to items categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers in any direction in the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015.
