25 Pension Scheme The Group sponsors two pension arrangements.
The following disclosures apply to both the Group and the Company.
The Alliance Trust Companies Pension Fund the Scheme is a funded defined benefit pension scheme which was closed to future accrual on 2 April 2011.
On 31 May 2016 the Trustees of the Scheme purchased an annuity with Legal & General.
The purpose of this transaction was to align the assets of the Scheme with long term liabilities and to reduce risk on long term liabilities.
The disclosures which follow relate to the Scheme.
Participating Employer ATSL is the sole Participating Employer and its pension obligations are guaranteed by the Company.
Valuation and Contributions The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 April 2015 although for the purpose of these calculations the results of the 1 April 2015 valuation have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2016.
Valuations are on the projected unit credit method.
In May 2016 the Board decided to inject 19.2m into the Scheme to fund the purchase of an annuity policy with Legal & General to match the Schemes liabilities to its members.
The annuity was purchased by the Trustees of the Scheme on 31 May 2016.
The SOCI reports a defined benefit plan net actuarial loss of 26.6m.
This is attributable to the 19.2m annuity purchase, a 0.2m employer contribution, a 0.4m IAS 19 credit recognised in the Income Statement and a 6.8m reduction of the Pension Scheme surplus.
Risks Following the purchase of the group annuity policy the principal risks the Scheme typically exposes the Group to are as follows: - Covenant risk: There is a risk that the insurance companies providing the annuities will fail, following which the responsibility for making the benefit payments under the Scheme would remain with the Scheme and ultimately the Company.
This risk is mitigated as in the event of insurer insolvency, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme would apply, providing some protection to the Scheme.
- Investment risk: The risk of the Scheme failing to hold investments to match the liabilities of the Scheme is extinguished by holding annuities.
Any failure of an insurance company involved could however return this risks to the Scheme.
- Actuarial risk: The Trustees are aware that there are actuarial risks associated with the longevity of the members, interest rates and inflation.
Although these are now matched by annuities this does not however totally remove actuarial risk, as any failure of an insurance company involved could return these risks to the Scheme.
