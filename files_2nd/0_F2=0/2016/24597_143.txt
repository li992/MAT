Goodwill Goodwill at the period end was allocated as follows: CGU Underwriting Retail Total Cost m m m As at 1 January 2015, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 374.8 95.2 470.0 The goodwill of 470.0m arose from the acquisition of Hastings Insurance Group Limited HIG by HIG H on 8 January 2014 and was allocated between the Groups two CGUs, Underwriting and Retail.
The recoverable amount of the two CGUs has been determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the most recent three year financial plans approved by the Directors, discounted by the Groups pre-tax discount rate of 8.0% 2015: 8.2%.
The Directors determine financial budgets based on past performance and their expectations of market and business development.
Cash flows beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated using growth rates declining to a terminal rate of 2%, representing the long term average growth rate for the insurance industry.
As the recoverable amount of each CGU is significantly higher than the cumulative total of allocated goodwill and the carrying value of the CGUs assets, the allocated goodwill is not deemed to be impaired.
