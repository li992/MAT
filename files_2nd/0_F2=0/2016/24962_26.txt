Atthe year end, capital comprised: Restated 2016 2015 $m $m Total equity 687.2 589.4 Cash and cash equivalents 4.5 15.0 Loan receivable from subsidiaries note C5 245.6 171.2 Net cash 250.1 156.2 Capital employed 437.1 433.2 The increase in total equity during the year is mainly attributable to the equity placing which raised $83.9m after costs, together with the retained profit for the year of $12.0m and an increase in the share-based payments reserve of $8.0m, offset by dividend payments of $5.9m and other expenses of $0.2m.
The Company was able to reduce its borrowings during the year as it received dividends from its subsidiaries of $15.3m.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include non-current receivables from subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2016.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions and on non-financial assets and liabilities.
Hunting PLC 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 137 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED C10.
Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Companys results, that is, an increase inrates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
a Interest Rate Sensitivity The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.5% 2015 0.5% in US interest rates, is to increase profits by $1.0m 2015 $0.6m.
If the US interest rates were to decrease by 0.5% 2015 0.5%, then the post-tax impact would be to reduce profits by $1.0m 2015 $0.6m.
The movements arise on US dollar denominated intra-group loans.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in interest rates.
b Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 15% 2015 10% in the Sterling foreign exchange rate, is to increase profits by $0.1m 2015 $0.2m.
If the Sterling foreign exchange ratewas to decrease by 15% 2015 10%, then the post-tax impact would be to reduce profits by $0.2m 2015 $0.2m.
The movement in the income statement arises from Sterling denominated accruals and other payables, offset by Sterling cash and cash equivalents.
There is no impact on OCI for a change in foreign exchange rates.
Post-Employment Benefits The Company has no employees and therefore does not participate in any of the post-employment benefit schemes shown in note29 of the Groups financial statements, although it does guarantee the contributions due by the participating employers.
