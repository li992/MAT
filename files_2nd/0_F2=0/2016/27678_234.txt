Each preference share confers on the holder the right to capital of the company in the form of a cash dividend prior to payment of dividends to any other class of shareholder.
The rate is limited to 83.3% of the prevailing prime rate on a deemed value of R10 and is never compounded.
If a preference dividend is not declared, the dividend will not accumulate and will never become payable by the company, whether in preference to payments to any other class of share or otherwise.
Each preference share confers on the holder the right to a return of capital on the winding-up of the company prior to any payment to any other class of share, but holders are not entitled to any further participation in the profits, assets or any surplus assets of the company in such circumstances.
Preference shareholders are only entitled to vote during periods when a dividend or any part of it remains unpaid after the due date for payment or when resolutions are proposed that directly affect any rights attaching to the shares or the rights of the holders.
During the year, preference shares with a carrying value of 26 million were purchased by a subsidiary of Nedbank and were classified as treasury shares.
Tier 1 perpetual subordinated instruments On 20 May 2016, Nedbank Limited issued a R1,500 million new-style Basel III-compliant additional Tier 1 capital instrument at 3-month JIBAR 7.
On 25 November 2016, Nedbank Limited issued a R500 million new-style Basel III-compliant additional Tier 1 capital instrument at 3-month JIBAR 6.3% with a call date of 26 November 2021.

The payment of interest is at the discretion of the issuer and interest payments are non-cumulative.
In addition, if certain conditions are reached the regulator may prohibit Nedbank from making interest payments.
Accordingly the instruments are classified as equity instruments and disclosed as non-controlling interest.
I: Interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements I1: Subsidiaries Critical accounting estimates and judgements Investments in subsidiaries and associated undertakings The Group has applied the following key judgements in the application of the requirements of the consolidation set of standards IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements : Consolidation of investment funds and securitisation vehicles The Group acts as a fund manager to a number of investment funds.
In determining whether the Group controls such a fund, it will focus on an assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group comprising any carried interests and expected management fees and the investors rights to remove the fund manager.
This general assessment is supplemented by an assessment of third-party rights in the investment funds, with regards to their practical ability to allow the Group not to control the fund.
The Group assesses, on an annual basis, such interests to determine if the fund will be consolidated.
The non-controlling interests in investment funds consolidated by the Group are classified as third-party interests in consolidated funds, a financial liability, in the consolidated statement of financial position.
These interests are classified at fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value, which is equal to the bid value of the number of units of the investment funds scheme not owned by the Group.
See note I3 b for disclosures in respect of the investment funds in which the Group has an interest.
The Group has sponsored certain asset-backed financing securitisation vehicles under its securitisation programme which are run according to predetermined criteria that are part of the initial design of the vehicles.
The Group is exposed to variability of returns from the vehicles through its holding of junior debt securities in the vehicles.
It has concluded that it controls these vehicles and therefore has consolidated these asset-backed financing vehicles.
continued Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 251 Structured entities The Group is required to make judgements on what constitutes a structured entity.
Accounting standards define a structured entity as an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such investees in which it has an economic interest, the Group considers numerous factors.
These factors may include the purpose and design of the investee, its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee, the nature of its relationship with the investee and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the investee.
The Group has evaluated all exposures and has concluded that all investments in investment funds as well as certain securitisation vehicles and other funding vehicles represent investments in structured entities.
Information on structured entities is included in note I3.

Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 255 b Aggregate financial information of material investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures The aggregate financial information for material investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures is as follows: 31 December m Ecobank Transnational Incorporated Banco nico, SA 2016 2015 2016 2015 Fair-value of investment in Ecobank Transnational Incorporated based on the closing quoted price on the Nigerian Stock Exchange 144 303 Statement of comprehensive income Revenue 1,043 1,059 23 Profit from continuing operations 158 203 2 Post-tax loss from discontinued operations 1 1 Other comprehensive income loss 471 180 Total comprehensive income 314 22 2 Statement of financial position Current assets 9,678 9,165 151 Non-current assets 7,238 6,835 94 Current liabilities 8,309 7,565 113 Non-current liabilities 7,037 6,617 105 Net assets 1,570 1,818 27 As in previous financial years, one of the Groups associate investments ETI will report results for the year ended 31 December 2016 subsequent to the release of the Groups audited consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, as allowed by IAS 28, the Group uses the most recent public information of ETI as at 30 September 2016 i. e. a quarter in arrears to determine its share of ETIs earnings.
In addition, as required by IAS 28, the Group considers whether adjustments for significant transactions or events between 30 September 2016 and 31 December 2016 are required based on publicly available information.
The resulting equity accounted earnings are translated from US dollar to rand and from rand to pound at the average exchange rate applicable for the quarter in which the Group accounts for the earnings.
The Groups share of the net assets of ETI is translated from US dollars to rand and from rand to pound at the closing exchange rate.
After application of the equity method, an entity determines whether there are indicators of impairment in terms of IAS 39.
If impairment is indicated, the amount to be recognised as an impairment loss is calculated by reference to IAS 36.
In terms of IAS 39 indicators of impairment include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an associate below its carrying value.
In addition information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the associate operates are also indicators that the carrying value of the associate may not be recovered.
The carrying value of Nedbank Groups strategic investment in ETI decreased from R7.
8 billion 460 million to R4.0 billion 235 million during the year, due to a combination of foreign currency translation losses arising from the naira devaluation and therefore ETIs balance sheet decreasing in US dollars, the rand strengthening against the US dollar, our share of losses incurred by ETI during the 12 months to 30 September 2016, as well as an impairment provision of R1.0 billion 50 million.
The market value of the Groups investment in ETI, based on its quoted share price, was R2.4 billion 142 million on 31 December 2016 and R2.1 billion 124 million on 24 February 2017.
The ETI share trades in low volumes, given its low free float, while also being listed in a market that is itself thinly traded.
The difference between market value and carrying value is significant and prolonged, which represented evidence of an impairment indicator at 31 December 2016.
Where there is an impairment indicator, International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS determined that an impairment test be computed, which compares the value in use VIU and the carrying value of the investment.
The computation of the VIU in accordance with IFRS is subject to significant judgement as it is base on, inter alia, economic estimates, macro assumptions and the discounting of future cashflow estimates.
This is particularly complicated in the current economic environment in many of the jurisdictions in which ETI operates and with the limited public information available.
As a result, management has computed the VIU based on a number of scenarios by taking into account publicly available information.
Based on this VIU calculation, management determined that an impairment provision of R1.0 billion 50 million was appropriate.
This has reduced the carrying value of the Groups investment to R4.0 billion 235 million at 31 December 2016.
This calculation is required to be revisited at each reporting period where the indicators of impairment would be reconsidered and the VIU calculation would be reassessed taking into account any future changes in estimates and assumptions.
Any significant changes after this reporting period that require the VIU calculation or underlying carrying value of the ETI investment to be revisited could result in a further impairment or a release of the current R1.0 billion 50 million impairment provision.
The impairment was recorded within operating and administrative expenses and is excluded from the determination of adjusted operating profit.
Regulatory capital was not impacted as the impairment amount was less than the full threshold deduction already taken against regulatory capital.
The Groups strategic investment in ETI has been impaired in accordance with the IFRS accounting considerations and the main driver of this was the significant change in the economic estimates and macro assumptions from Nigeria.
ETI has been an important long-term investment for Nedbank, providing its clients with a pan African transactional banking network across 39 countries and access to dealflow in Central and West Africa since its acquisition in 2014.
Nedbank remains supportive of ETIs endeavours of delivering an ROE in excess of its COE in due course.
Conditions in the key markets in which ETI operates are currently expected to remain difficult in 2017, before improving in 2018 and beyond.

The above table includes those investments that are carried at fair value.
The Group has no significant investments in which it owns less than 20% of the ordinary share capital that it accounts for using the equity method.
e Restriction on the Groups ability to obtain funds from its associate undertakings and joint arrangements Statutory and regulatory restrictions in terms of the South African Reserve Bank controls and solvency restrictions imposed by the Financial Service Board in South Africa to comply with statutory capital requirements restrict the amount of funds that can be transferred out of the country to the Group.
No significant guarantees were provided by the Group during the financial year.
f Contingent liabilities and commitments At 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the Group had no significant contingent liabilities or commitments relating to investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures.
g Other Group holdings The above does not include companies whereby the Group has a holding of more than 20%, but does not have significant influence over these companies by virtue of the Group not having any direct involvement in decision-making or the other owners possessing veto rights.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 257 I3: Structured entities a Groups involvement in structured entities The table below summarises the types of structured entities the Group does not consolidate, but may have an interest in: Type of structured entity Nature Purpose Interest held by the Group Securitisation vehicles for loans Finance the Groups own assets Generate: Investment in senior notes and advances through the issue of notes to Funding for the Groups issued by the vehicles investors lending activities Margin through sale of assets to investors Fees for loan servicing Investment funds Manage client funds through Generate fees from managing Investments in units issued by the investment in assets assets on behalf of third-party the fund investors Securitisation vehicles for thirdFinance third party receivables Generate fees from arranging Interest in these vehicles is party receivables and are financed through loans the structure.

In the normal course of business the Group will lend money to structured entities that are engaged in project finance work, such as renewable energy projects.
The funding of these entities does not result in the Group being able to exercise control of these entities rather it is protected by normal lending covenants.
In certain circumstances, the Group may take a direct equity stake in the underlying Project Finance activity, in which circumstances the Group will evaluate the appropriate treatment of this investment.
b Consolidation considerations for structured entities In structured entities voting rights are not the predominant factor in deciding who controls the entity but rather the Groups exposure to the variability of returns from these entities.
The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds.
Determining whether the Group controls such an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of decision-making rights as fund manager, the investors rights to remove the fund manager and the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the fund in the form of interest held and exposure to variable returns.
In most instances the Groups decision-making authority, in its capacity as fund manager, with regard to these funds is regarded to be well-defined.
Discretion is exercised when decisions regarding the relevant activities of these funds are being made.
For funds managed by the Group where the investors have the right to remove the Group as fund manager without cause, the fees earned by the Group, are considered to be market related.
These agreements include only terms, conditions or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services and level of skills negotiated on an arms length basis.
The Group has concluded that it acts as agent on behalf of the investors in all instances.
The Group is considered to be acting as principal where the Group is the fund manager and is able to make the investment decisions on behalf of the unit holders who earn a variable fee, and there are no kick out rights that would remove the Group as fund manager.
During 2016, the Group has re-evaluated the criteria applied in determining whether investment funds should be consolidated under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements in the Group financial statements.
This has resulted in the identification of additional investments funds that are required to be included in the consolidated financial statements.
As a result, comparative information has been restated.
Refer to note A2 for further information.
The Group has not provided any non-contractual support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has committed to providing certain liquidity facilities for certain securitisation vehicles.
Disclosure of consolidated securitisation vehicles, which are structured entities, is included in note I3 c. Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 258 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 I: Interests in subsidiaries, associates, and joint arrangements continued I3: Structured entities continued c Securitisation vehicles consolidated in the Groups statement of financial position Nedbank Securitisations Nedbank Group Ltd uses securitisation primarily as a funding diversification tool and to add flexibility in mitigating structural liquidity risk.
The Group currently has four active traditional securitisation transactions: Synthesis Funding Ltd Synthesis, an asset-backed commercial paper ABCP programme Greenhouse Funding RF Ltd, Greenhouse, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme Greenhouse Funding III RF Ltd, Greenhouse III, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme, and Precinct Funding 1 RF Ltd Precinct Funding 1, a commercial mortgage-backed securitisation programme.
Synthesis Funding Ltd Synthesis primarily invests in long-term rated bonds and offers capital market funding to SA corporates.
These assets are funded through the issuance of short-dated investment-grade commercial paper to institutional investors.
All the commercial paper issued by Synthesis is assigned the highest short-term RSA local-currency credit rating by Global Credit Rating Co Pty Ltd. At 31 December 2016, none of the commercial paper in issue was listed on JSE Ltd.
Liquidity facilities have been obtained from a P-1.
za Moodys or zaA-1 Standard & Poors rated bank in order to ensure the availability of sufficient funds in instances where timing mismatches could occur.
These timing mismatches refer to the possible mismatch between the receipt of funds relating to financial assets and the disbursement of funds relating to the redemption of financial liabilities.
These liquidity facilities cover the nominal value of the commercial paper issued and exceed the maturity date of the underlying commercial paper by five days.
Synthesis is a partially supported conduit whose credit support is dependent on transaction-specific credit enhancement as well as available programme-wide credit enhancement PWCE provided by Nedbank.
PWCE is calculated as 5% of the aggregate book value of financial assets excluding defaults plus a dynamic percentage based on the credit quality of the underlying portfolio of the rated securities.
If a rated security falls below AAZA sf, Synthesis must remove the asset from the portfolio or obtain a guarantee by an entity rated at least AAZA sf or Nedbank must post PWCE within 15 business days.
Currently all securities in the conduit portfolio are rated at least AAZA sf or are guaranteed by Nedbank if rated below AAZA sf.
As a result no PWCE is currently required in accordance with Synthesis transaction documentation.
On 8 December 2016, the Directors and shareholder of Synthesis resolved, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals, to unwind the commercial-paper programme following the disposal by the company of all its assets the unwind disposal.
This unwind disposal will be effected during the 2017 financial year.
Greenhouse programmes Greenhouse and Greenhouse III The Greenhouse transactions are securitisation vehicles through which the rights, title, interest and related security in respect of residential home loans are acquired from Nedbank Ltd under a  programme.
During December 2007 the first Greenhouse transaction was created and R2 billion 1 18 million of home loans from Nedbank Ltd were securitised.
Greenhouse was subsequently restructured and refinanced on 19 November 2012 as a static amortising structure.
The proceeds from the refinance of this transaction, through the issuance of new notes and subordinated loans, were utilised to repay the R1.3 billion 77 million existing notes and subordinated loans on their scheduled maturity, and to acquire additional home loans from Nedbank Ltd.
The senior notes, which are rated by Moodys Investors Service Ltd Moodys and listed on JSE Ltd, were placed with third-party investors, and the junior notes and subordinated loans retained by the Group.
The home loans transferred to Greenhouse have continued to be recognised as financial assets.
Greenhouse III, a second standalone  securitisation programme, was implemented during 2014.
Greenhouse III securitised R2 billion 1 18 million worth of home loans originated by Nedbank Ltd through the issuance of senior notes to the capital market and subordinated notes and a subordinated loan provided by Nedbank Ltd.
The notes issued by Greenhouse III are listed on JSE Ltd and rated by Moodys.
The Greenhouse vehicles make use of an internal risk management policy, and utilises the Nedbank Group credit risk monitoring process to govern lending activities to external parties.
In addition, financial assets may be introduced into the programme only if they meet the eligibility criteria of the programme agreements.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 259 Nedbank Ltd provided the Greenhouse programmes with interest-bearing subordinated loans at the commencement of each programme to provide part of the initial funding.
Interest is payable on a quarterly basis, as part of the priority of payments.
The full capital amount outstanding plus any accrued interest will be payable in full on the final maturity date, provided that all outstanding notes have been redeemed in full and all secured creditors have been settled.
In the Greenhouse structure, Nedbank holds the class C and class Y notes amounting to R1 13 million 7 million and in the Greenhouse III structure, Nedbank holds the class D note, amounting to R100 million 6 million.
These notes are subordinated to the higher-ranking notes in terms of the priority of payments.
Precinct Funding 1 Precinct Funding 1 is a  securitisation programme.
