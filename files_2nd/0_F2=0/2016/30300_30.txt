The address of the registered office and principal place of business is given on the final page of this Annual Report.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic report on pages6 to50.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange LSE under the ticker VEC.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterlingbecause that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included inaccordance with the policies set out below.
Adoption of new and revised Standards The following amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and a new interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB have been applied by the Group in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010 2012 Cycle and 20112013 Cycle The Group has adopted the amendments toIFRSs included in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 201012 Cycle and 201113 Cycle for the first time in the current year.
The adoption of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in thesefinancial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 amendments Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception IFRS 11 amendments Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IAS 1 amendments Disclosure Initiative IAS 12 amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IAS 16 and IAS 38 amendments Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation IAS 27 amendments Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Annual IFRS Improvements Process 20122014 cycle Sep 14 : Amendments to: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows: IFRS 9 simplifies financial instrument classifications and hedge accounting rules as well as introducing impairment requirements for loans.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and replaces all existing revenue requirements in IFRS.
Thecore principle is that revenue will be recognised at an amount reflecting the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
It may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and it removes the current distinction between an operating and finance lease, introducing consistent requirements for all leases similar to the current finance lease accounting.
The lease value for leased premises as well as other smaller trade related operating leases will be brought onto the balance sheet at the fair value of the future minimum lease payments.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs and related interpretations as adopted by the European Union and, therefore, the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standard IAS Regulation.
The Group and Company financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared inaccordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and the related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The parent company loss for the year ended 31 March 2016 is 4.7m 2014 15: 3.2m profit.
102 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Basis of preparation continued The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, revised for use of fair values where required by applicable IFRSs.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if a market participant would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements and or disclosures in these consolidated financial statements are determined on such basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Going concern The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Although certain economic conditions may place pressures on customers and suppliers who may face liquidity issues, the Groups product diversity and customer and supplier base substantially mitigate these risks.
In addition, the Group operates in the relatively defensive pharmaceutical industry which we expect to be less affected compared toother industries.
The Group made a profit after tax of 5.0m for the financial year ended 31 March 2016 2014 15: 3.7m and had 99.8m of cash and cash equivalents as at 31 March 2016 2015: 90.0m.
The Board operates an investment policy under which the primary objective is to invest in low-risk cash or cash equivalent investments to safeguard the principal.
The Groups forecasts, taking into account likely revenue streams, show that the Group has sufficient funds to operate for the foreseeable future.
After reviewing the Groups forecasts and assessing the uncertain nature of some of the Groups forecast revenues, the Directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage its business and financing risks successfully.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated annual financial statements comprise the financial statements of Vectura Group plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year.
Control is achieved when the Company: has power over the investee: is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the part of the reporting year during which the Group had control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Adjustments are made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents the amount receivable for goods and services provided and royalties earned, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Royalty income Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis and represents income earned as a percentage of product sales in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement, net of amounts payable to other licensees.
Technology and product licensing Technology and product licensing income represents amounts earned for licences provided under licensing agreements, including up-front payments, milestone payments and technology access fees.
Revenues are recognised where they are non-refundable: the Groups obligations related to the revenues have been discharged and their collection is reasonably assured.
Refundable licensing revenue is treated as deferred until such time that the above criteria have been met.
Milestone payments relating to scientific or technical achievements are recognised as income when the milestone is accomplished.
Development services Development services revenues principally comprise contract product development and contract clinical trial manufacturing fees invoiced to third parties.
Revenues are recognised upon the completion of agreed tasks or numbers of person days and in the period to which they relate.
Device sales Device sales are recognised when goods are delivered to customers.
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16 Vectura Group plc 103 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate ofthe fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement as they are incurred.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Group has a twelve-month period in which to finalise the fair values allocated to assets and liabilities determined provisionally on acquisition.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held interest in the acquiree if any, the excess is recognised immediately in profit orloss as a bargain purchase gain.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the date of acquisition that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill Goodwill recognised under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP prior to 1 April 2004 is stated at net book value at that date.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary or associate undertakings and businesses subsequent to 1 April 2004, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, iscapitalised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed forimpairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Forthe purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination ofthe profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination are carried initially at fair value.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Development expenditure on internally developed intangible assets is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred except where expenditure relating to clearly defined and identifiable development projects meets the following criteria, in which case development expenditure will be recognised as an intangible asset: in accordance with IAS 38: the projects technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated: the availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have been confirmed: the correlation between development costs and future revenues has been established: and the economic benefit is expected to flow to the entity.
Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Patents, trademarks and licence agreements between three and ten years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
104 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Buildings twenty years Leasehold improvements to buildings three to seven years Laboratory equipment three to seven years Office and IT equipment three years Freehold land is not depreciated The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Useful life and residual value are reviewed annually.
Assets are classified as under the course of construction until such a time as the asset is capable of being used in the manner intended.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise fromthe continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant or equipment isdetermined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, the assets or disposal groups are available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of the classification.
Immediately prior to being classified as held for sale the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are measured in accordance with the applicable standard.
After classification as held for sale it is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for any initial and subsequent write-down of the asset and disposal group to fair value less costs to sell.
A gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it is not inexcess of the cumulative impairment loss previously recognised.
Non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated tothe smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments for the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss isrecognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation.
In the Company accounts investments are carried at historic cost, less provision for impairment.
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16 Vectura Group plc 105 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Investments in associates and joint ventures The Groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups interests in its joint ventures are also accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
The Groups Consolidated Income Statement reflects the Groups share of any income and expense recognised by the associate or joint venture outside profit and loss.
The Group does not recognise losses in excess of the value of its investments.
Inventories Inventories comprise goods held for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs include the direct costs and, where applicable, an attributable proportion of distribution overheads incurred in bringing inventories to their current location and condition.
Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or as available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
When financial assets are recognised, initially they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity ofthree months or less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively as finance income or finance costs.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value and, if material, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the expected life of the financial liability.
Leasing Operating leases and the annual rentals are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease in accordance with the terms of the lease agreements.
106 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Any gain orlossarising from achange in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in thestatement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured as the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts inthe financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not abusiness combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise, deferred tax isrecognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Research and development tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis.
Post-retirement benefits The Group contributes a set proportion of employees gross salary to defined contribution personal pension plans.
The amount charged tothe Consolidated Income Statement in respect of pension costs is the contribution payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as prepayments or as payables in the balance sheet.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributed to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16 Vectura Group plc 107 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes, including a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, under which shares may be granted to staff members.
The level of grant to members of staff under the LTIP is dependent upon the total shareholder return of Vectura a market condition compared to a peer group of UK pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
In accordance with IFRS 2, for all grants of share options and awards, the cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to their fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The Black-Scholes model is used to determine fair value for options and the Monte Carlo binomial model for LTIP awards.
The cost of equity-settled share transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period until the award vests.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-based transactions reflects theextent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors at that date, will ultimately vest.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemptions afforded by IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards and has appliedIFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions, in accordance with IFRS, that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment tothe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, the measurement and review for impairment of definite and indefinite-life intangible assets goodwill, revenue recognition and the treatment of research and development expenditure in line with the relevant accounting policy.
Estimation uncertainty Intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
In determining the fair value of acquired intangibles, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent that is available.
To the extent that such inputs are not available, the Group works closely with external valuation experts to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model.
Estimation uncertainty Impairment of goodwill The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired and this requires the estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Critical accounting judgements Revenue recognition The recognition of milestone revenue income requires an assessment of the Groups future obligations under a given contract, whichdetermines the period over which the revenue is recognised.
Critical accounting judgements Research and development costs The treatment of research and development expenditure requires an assessment of the expenditure in order to determine whether ornotit is appropriate to capitalise onto the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 38.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are assessed using a value-in-use model.
An impairment provision is recognised only if the goodwill carrying value exceeds this value in use.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to contribution during the period.
The model has been based on the most recent cash flow forecasts prepared by management, which consist of detailed probability-weighted product-by-product analyses.
These forecasts are based on development timings and specific projections for sales volumes over the likely period in which cash flows could be expected, being a period up to fifteen years for impairment review purposes.
No terminal values have been included in the cash flow forecasts.
No general growth rates are assumed.
The pre-tax discount rates used in the forecasts range from between 12.3% and 14.4%.
Following the acquisition of Activaero GmbH in March 2014, and for the purpose ofimpairment testing of goodwill, the Group is split into two CGUs, being the Vectura CGU and the Activaero CGU.
Goodwill has been allocated to the following CGUs: 2016 2015 m m Vectura CGU 49.6 49.6 1 Activaero CGU 7.8 7.2 57.4 56.8 1 The underlying currency of the goodwill associated with the Activaero GmbH CGU is the Euro.
The goodwill balance of 9.9m is translated into sterling atthe prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Any foreign exchange gain or loss is taken to the translation reserve, as shown in the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income.
The movement of 0.6m shown in the table above relates solely to movements in the exchange rate between 31 March 2015 and31March 2016.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Company m Carrying amount: At 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 2.0 The goodwill in the Company arose on the acquisition of the Centre for Drug Formulation Studies, an unincorporated entity, in 1999.
Amortisation of 0.7m was applied prior to 1 April 2004.
Goodwill in the Company is tested for impairment using the same discount ratesand on the same basis as for the Group.

Financial instruments continued Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.
Financial risk management The Groups objective in using financial instruments is to maximise the returns on funds held on deposit, to minimise exchange rate risk where appropriate, and to generate additional cash resources through the issue of shares when appropriate.
Balance sheets at 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 are not necessarily representative of the positions throughout the year, as cash and short-term investments fluctuate considerably throughout the year depending on the timing of working capital receipts.
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The Group is funded principally through equity and invests its funds in short-term bank deposits.
The Group has access to the majority ofthese deposits at a maximum of 24 hours notice.
The Groups policy throughout the period has been to minimise the risk by placing funds inlow-risk cash deposits, but also to maximise the return on funds placed on deposit.
Interest on overnight cash deposits is calculated on the basis of a floating rate set at between 5 and 10 basis points below seven-day sterling London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups principal functional currency is sterling.
However, the Group has a German subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro and the Group as a whole undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to offset its currency exposure by matching foreign currency revenues with expenditure in the same foreign currency.
Where there are no imminent foreign exchange transactions, the balances are exchanged for sterling at spot rate.
All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling other than those shown below: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Net financial assets: Euro 0.7 1.9 US dollar 11.8 22.9 12.5 24.8 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 15% increase and decrease 2014 15: 10% in sterling against the euro and US dollar: 15% represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk management As explained overleaf, the Group has an RCF with HSBC Bank plc.
As at 31 March 2016 and as at the date of these financial statements, the facility has not been utilised and as such the Group has no external borrowings.
Therefore it is not currently exposed to interest rate risk through borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents earned 0.3m of finance income during the year 2014 15: 0.4m.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower, being managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates, and all other variables were constant, the Groups operating loss for the year ended 31 March 2016 would decrease increase by 0.5m 2014 15: 0.4m.
All the Groups monetary assets and liabilities are held at floating rates.
Liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by continually monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Credit risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributed to its cash and cash equivalents.
The Board operates an investment policy, under which the primary objective is to invest in a diverse portfolio of low-risk cash or cash equivalent investments to safeguard the principal.
The Groups credit risk on trade and other receivables is low as the amounts are owed by large, multinational, pharmaceutical companies.
For the same reason, the Directors assess the quality of these assets as high.
Market risk management The Groups exposure to market risk primarily comprises interest rate exposure.
Group funds are invested in cash deposits with the objective of maintaining a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
