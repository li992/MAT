Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams.

Do not get into a conversation: note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
Check the Financial Services Register from www.
uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
Use the firms contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
Search the FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms at www.
Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Seek impartial advice from a financial adviser before you make an investment.
Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
