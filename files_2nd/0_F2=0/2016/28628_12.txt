Investment in new systems continues at a steady pace as we continue to improve the efficiency of our systems and our back office.
Although some of this is driven by regulatory change, much is driven by our desire to optimise the service that our clients receive and to give our investment managers the tools they need to manage portfolios more easily.
In 2017, we plan to install a new client relationship management system.
Excluding the London office fit out costs, new investment accounted for approximately 67% of capital expenditure in 2016, with the balance being maintenance and replacement of existing software and equipment.
This split is broadly consistentwith the spending pattern in the recent past.
