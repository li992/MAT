2015 and 2016 are presented as the continuing Group as reported.
The significant changes in the Group in those years as a result of the rights issue, the acquisition of Landmark and the disposal of ASIG mean that the 2016 and 2015 financials presented above are not compaable with our years.
The dividend per share for the year ended 31 December 2015 totalled 13.53 being an interim dividend of 4.85 per share plus the final dividend per share of 8.68.
Removing the impact of the rights issue the total dividend per share for 2015 would have been 12.15.
