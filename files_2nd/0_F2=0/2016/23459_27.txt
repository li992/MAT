Notes to the Financial Statements 1 General Information Electrocomponents plc the Company is a company domiciled in England.
The Company is a public company and is incorporated and domiciled in England.
The address of its registered office is International Management Centre, 8050 Oxford Business Park North, Oxford OX4 2HW.
2 Statement of compliance The individual financial statements of Electrocomponents plc have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland FRS 102 and the Companies Act 2006.
3 Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The company has adopted FRS 102 in these financial statements.
Details of the transition to FRS 102 are disclosed in note 20 on page 140. a Basis of preparation These are the companys separate financial statements and they have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention, as modified by the recognition of certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and are presented on pages 83 to 125.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the companys accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 4. b Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102 Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss Account.
The Company is a group parent holding company.
It is included in the consolidated financial statements of Electrocomponents plc.
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions, subject to certain conditions, which have been complied with, including notification of, and no objection to, the use of exemptions by the Companys shareholders.
The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions: i. from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these financial statements, includes the Companys cash flows: ii.
from the financial instrument disclosures, required under FRS 102 paragraphs 11.39 to 11.48A and paragraphs 12.26 to 12.29, as the information is provided in the consolidated financial statement disclosures: iii.
in accordance with FRS 102 35.10 b, from disclosing certain share based payment arrangements, required under FRS 102 paragraphs 26.18 b, 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23, concerning its own equity instruments.
The Company financial statements are presented with the consolidated financial statements and the relevant disclosures are included therein: and iv.
from disclosing the Company key management personnel compensation, as required by FRS 102 paragraph 33.7.
128 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued b Going concern The Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank facilities as detailed in note 21 to the Group accounts.
The current economic conditions continue to create uncertainty over the level of demand for the Companys products for the foreseeable future.
The Companys detailed forecasts and projections for the next three years, taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, together with its strong balance sheet show that the Company should be able to continue to operate within the level of its current facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
c Translation of foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the Profit and Loss Account.
d Basic financial instruments Financial assets Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances and investments, are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment.
If an asset is impaired the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the impairment is reversed.
The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.
The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price.
Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Financial assets are derecognised when a the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or b substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party or c control of the asset has been transferred to another party who has the practical ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party without imposing additional restrictions.
com Electrocomponents plc 129 Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Financial liabilities Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, bank loans and loans from fellow Group companies, are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
e Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Company has elected to adopt the recognition and measurement provisions of IAS 39 as adopted for use in the EU and the disclosure provisions of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from operational and financing activities.
It principally employs forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in exchange rates.
In addition there are also interest rate swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into a floating rate.
In accordance with its treasury policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Companys risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a forecast transaction.
All the Groups derivatives are initially and in subsequent periods recognised in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss in finance costs or income as appropriate.
Following a review of the cash pooling accounting policy, the Company has decided to change its presentation of derivative contracts to show the gross balances.
130 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Cash flow hedge accounting Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the non-financial asset or liability.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss that was recognised directly in equity is reclassified into the profit and loss in the same period during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the difference between their discounted contractual forward price and their current forward price.
Fair value hedge accounting The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to interest rate risks arising from financing activities, holding interest rate swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into floating rate.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the market value of the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates.
f Employee benefits The Company provides a range of benefits to employees, including annual bonus arrangements, paid holiday arrangements and defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Short term benefits Short term benefits, including holiday pay and other similar non-monetary benefits, are recognised as an expense in the period in which the service is received.
Defined contribution pension plan The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Once the contributions have been paid the Company has no further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
Amounts not paid are shown in accruals in the balance sheet.
The assets of the plan are held separately from the Company in independently administered funds.
com Electrocomponents plc 131 Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Defined benefit pension plan The Company operates a defined benefit plan for certain employees.
A defined benefit plan defines the pension benefit that the employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent upon several factors including age, length of service and remuneration.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting date less the fair value of the plan assets at the reporting date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method.
Annually the Company engages independent actuaries to calculate the obligation.
The present value is determined by discounting the estimated future payments using market yields on high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling and that have terms approximating the estimated period of the future payments discount rate.
The fair value of plan assets is measured in accordance with the FRS 102 fair value hierarchy and in accordance with the Companys policy for similarly held assets.
This includes the use of appropriate valuation techniques.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
These amounts together with the return on plan assets, less amounts included in net interest, are disclosed as Remeasurement of net defined benefit liability.
The cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in profit or loss as employee costs, except where included in the cost of an asset, comprises: a. the increase in pension benefit liability arising from employee service during the period: and b. the cost of plan introductions, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
This cost is recognised in profit or loss Finance expense.
g Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
h Investments Investments in subsidiary companies are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
i Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price, costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, dismantling and restoration costs and borrowing costs capitalised.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate the cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 2% Plant and machinery 10% 20% Computer equipment 20% 33% j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
132 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 4 Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty The preparation of accounts requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The significant judgements made in the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 were in relation to the following: Pensions The Company has obligations to pay pension benefits to certain employees.
The cost of these benefits and the present value of the obligation depend on a number of factors, which are listed in detail in note 8.
Management estimates these factors in determining the net pension obligation in the balance sheet.
The assumptions reflect historical experience and current trends.
5 Profit for the financial year The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 24.4 million 2015: 99.5 million.
A separate profit and loss account has not been presented in respect of the Company, as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Disclosure of the audit fees payable to  LLP for the audit of Electrocomponents plcs financial statements is made in note 4 of the Group accounts.
6 Employees Numbers employed 2016 2015 The average number of employees during the year was: Management and administration 53 49 Aggregate employment costs m m Wages and salaries 4.1 4.7 Social security costs 0.6 0.6 Share based payments 0.8 0.2 Pension costs 0.7 0.9 6.2 6.4 The remuneration of individual Directors is detailed on pages 50 to 73.
7 Share based payments Share-based payments The Company operates a number of share-based incentive plans for employees.
These comprise a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP awarded to the Groups most senior executives, a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awarding shares to senior managers and a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme which is made available to all eligible employees.
The Company recognises an equity-settled share-based payment expense based on a reasonable allocation of the total charge for the group.
The majority of employees in the UK schemes are employees of RS Components Limited and 23% of the total charge for the group for each UK scheme has been allocated to the Company as a result.
The total charge included in the Profit and Loss Account in the year was 0.7 million 2015: 0.2 million.
Of the total charge, 0.7 million 2015: 0.2 million related to equity-settled share schemes and nil 2015: nil related to cash-settled share schemes.
All profit and loss account charges relating to options held by members of other Group companies are charged to the appropriate Group company.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan Under the DSBP, awards of shares are made to plan participants to the value of 50% of their cash bonus.
The award vests after two years, normally subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no other performance conditions.
A cash payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the shares will be made to the participants on vesting.
com Electrocomponents plc 133 Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 7 Share based payments continued Long Term Incentive Plan Under the Groups LTIP, conditional awards of shares are made to the plan participants.
At the vesting date the share award will either vest, in full or in part, or lapse.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
The terms and conditions of the LTIP are such that the vesting conditions are based on both the performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and growth in Earnings per Share over the life of the scheme.
The fair value of the LTIP was calculated at the grant date using the Monte Carlo model.
This model is internationally recognised as being appropriate to value employee share schemes similar to the LTIP.
Save As You Earn Scheme The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
The option price is based on the average market price of Electrocomponents plcs shares over the three days prior to the offer, discounted by 20%.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for a three or five year period and the maintenance of the employees regular monthly savings.
Failure of either of these conditions is normally deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.
The fair value of the SAYE scheme was calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model.
This model is internationally recognised as being appropriate to value employee share schemes similar to the SAYE scheme.
8 Post-employment benefits Defined benefit scheme The UK defined benefit scheme is described in note 8 of the Group accounts.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2013 and has been updated to 31 March 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
The balance on the UK scheme is included within the balance sheet of RS Components Ltd, a subsidiary of Electrocomponents plc, as it is this Company which employs the majority of the scheme members.
The balance has not been split between Electrocomponents plc and RS Components Ltd, as it is not possible to do so on a consistent and reasonable basis.
This disclosure therefore relates to the UK pension scheme rather than just the Electrocomponents plc portion of it.
The scheme is managed by a corporate trustee, who is responsible for ensuring that the plan is sufficiently funded to meet current and future obligations.
On 1 April 2003, the defined benefit pension scheme was closed to new entrants.
At the same time, the Company established a defined contribution scheme to provide benefits to new employees.
There are no significant differences that have been identified as between IAS 19 revised 2011 IFRS and FRS 102 UK GAAP.

Any impairment is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
The cost of share-based incentives in respect of shares in the Company granted to employees of Group companies other than Electrocomponents plc, is treated as an increase in investments with the corresponding credit taken directly to reserves.

Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contracts as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
