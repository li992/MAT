Note 2b Separately disclosed items Separately disclosed items are costs or income that have been recognised in the income statement which the Directors believe, due to their nature or size, should be disclosed separately to give a more comparable view of the year-on-year underlying financial performance.
They are presented in their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure.
The following table gives further details of the items included.

They are principally staff and maintenance costs and decommissioning costs payable to RBS.
Other costs related to the separation from RBS principally relate to the costs of interim staff required to test and double-run systems as we ramp up to full platform launch.
The IPO-related costs largely comprise the costs of the one-off share awards granted to management as part of the IPO as well as costs which have been levied on Worldpay as a result of a change of control clause triggered by the IPO.
Reorganisation and restructuring costs are largely costs incurred in the turnaround of our WPUS business.
These include consultancy fees, redundancy costs and other staff-related costs.
Other costs include the costs associated with a long-standing litigation claim together with costs incurred on aborted M&A activity.
Separately disclosed items affecting depreciation and amortisation predominantly relate to the non-cash charge for amortisation of business combination intangible assets recognised on the divestment of the business from RBS, as well as subsequent strategic business acquisitions.
The net gain in the year in relation to separately disclosed items affecting finance income costs comprised an initial gain on the disposal of the Visa Europe shares of 207.0m 2015: share valuation gain of 195.7m, together with subsequent related fair value and FX gains, dividends received on the preference shares, and cash received which together amounted to 64.6m 2015: nil.
These were partly offset by a loss on valuation of the related CVR liabilities.
Further information on the Visa Europe disposal is provided later in Note 5i.
In addition to the gains and losses noted above, there was also a net FX loss resulting from the period-end translation of the Groups assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than Sterling excluding the assets and liabilities related to the Visa Europe disposal.
Further details on the separately disclosed items are set out in the Financial review on pages 54 to 55.
Note 2c Personnel expenses Expenses related to services rendered by employees are recognised in the year in which the service is rendered.
This includes wages and salaries, social security contributions, pension contributions, bonuses, termination benefits and share-based payment charges.
Where payments of amounts due are outstanding at the end of the reporting year, an accrual is recognised.
Where payments have been made in advance prior to the end of the reporting year, a prepayment is recognised.
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The amounts charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits are the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments on the balance sheet.
Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based upon estimation of the number of shares which will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Fair value is measured by reference to the market value of the Groups shares, adjusted as necessary for the terms and conditions of the award, or an appropriate option pricing model, depending on the nature of the award.
The Group recognised a charge of 7.3m in 2016 2015: 1.2m for equity-settled share-based payments.
Details of each of the equity-settled share-based payment plans are set out below.
Transitional award On the date of the IPO, the Group granted a transitional share award plan to certain members of the senior management team.
Shares will be given to eligible employees three years after the date of grant, subject to satisfaction of the minimum shareholding requirement and continued employment.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will be paid on vesting.
As at 31 December 2016, 5.9m shares were outstanding under the scheme and a charge of 5.6m 2015: 1.2m was made to the income statement.
Given the one-off nature of these share awards, the costs have been classified as separately disclosed items.
118 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 2 Results for the year continued Note 2c Personnel expenses continued Long-term incentive plans In March 2016, the Group introduced a Performance Share Plan PSP and a Conditional Share Plan CSP.
Both the PSP and the CSP mature three years from the grant date.
The vesting of the PSP shares is subject to satisfaction of non-market-based performance conditions.
The CSP shares have no performance conditions other than continued employment within the Group.
Under both plans the value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will be paid on vesting.
As at 31 December 2016, the PSP had 3.8m and the CSP had 0.7m shares outstanding.
Further details of the PSP can be found in the Remuneration report on page 85.
All employee share plans Save As You Earn scheme SAYE and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP In 2016, the Group introduced a SAYE plan in the UK and an ESPP in the US.
These two plans cover approximately 90% of our employee base and offer the opportunity for colleagues to save monthly in order to buy Worldpay Group plc shares at a discount.
The SAYE plan runs for a period of either three or five years depending on the length of contract chosen by the employee and the ESPP is run bi-annually for a six month plan period.
As at 31 December 2016, the SAYE scheme had 5.5m and the ESPP had 0.2m options outstanding.
The Black-Scholes option model has been used to determine the fair value of the options issued.
There are no inputs which are sufficiently sensitive to there being a reasonable possibility of a material adjustment in a future period.

Note 2g Tax Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax, including all applicable UK and foreign taxes, is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and bases of calculation which have been enacted or substantively enacted in the applicable jurisdiction for the current accounting year, together with any necessary adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous accounting periods.
Current tax is recognised in the income statement unless it arises from a transaction recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Relief for foreign taxation in calculating UK taxation liabilities is taken into account where appropriate.

The actual tax charge differs from the expected tax charge computed by applying the average UK corporation tax of 20.00% 2015: 20.25% as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Expected tax charge at UK corporation tax rate of 20.00% 2015: 20.25% 52.8 3.9 Non-deductible items 11.3 16.0 Visa Europe non-deductible CVR obligations see Note 5i 75.3 28.2 Prior year adjustment 1.7 3.8 Non-taxable income 0.8 1.4 Effect of different statutory tax rates of foreign jurisdictions 1.9 6.3 Effect of current year changes in statutory tax rates 12.3 0.5 Deferred tax prior year adjustment 2.2 10.2 Deferred tax on intangible assets 5.0 Deferred tax assets not recognised 0.5 7.6 Actual tax charge for the year 132.6 48.9 The underlying effective tax rate ETR has decreased from the prior year to 25.1% 2015: 26.4%.
This decrease in ETR represents the continued fall in tax rate for the UK, where the majority of the business activities for the Group occur.
The ETR remains higher than the UK statutory rate of 20.0% due to profits in overseas territories with higher taxation rates, mainly US 35% and the Netherlands 25%, along with non-deductible costs, and uncertain tax provisions relating primarily to transfer pricing uncertainties and estimates.
The ETR is expected to continue to reduce in future years as a result of the decrease in the UK statutory rate, down to the lower end of the range disclosed in the IPO prospectus 23% assuming an unchanging jurisdictional split of profits.
Provisions established for uncertain items are made using a best estimate of the tax expected to be paid, based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant information and managements judgement.
The Group reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of each reporting period and adjusts them based on changing facts and circumstances.

The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax charges and credits are recognised in the income statement unless they arise from a transaction recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are analysed in the consolidated balance sheet, after offset of balances within entities and tax jurisdictions, as follows: 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Deferred tax assets 4.6 12.9 Deferred tax liabilities 112.3 145.1 107.7 132.2 The Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 8.1m 2015: 8.0m which relates to losses carried forward.
The deferred tax asset on the tax losses has not been recognised due to uncertainty over future utilisation.
There is also an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 45.6m 2015: nil in relation to the Loss Share Agreement with respect to the Visa Europe transaction.
The deferred tax asset has not been recognised as, depending on the timing of the final resolution on the indemnity position, the availability of tax relief will be conditional on HMRC accepting a concessionary treatment.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, before offset of balances within entities and tax jurisdictions, are as follows: Accelerated capital Provisions Visa allowances other Intangibles Losses Europe Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2015 12.0 13.0 110.4 85.4 Charge credit to income statement 20.3 37.4 10.9 46.8 At 31 December 2015 8.3 24.4 99.5 132.2 Reclassification of deferred tax balances 10.2 16.6 18.3 14.5 39.2 Reclassification to current tax 15.1 0.1 3.5 11.7 Credit charge to income statement 3.8 4.1 7.8 10.7 6.6 11.6 Foreign exchange rate impact 2.5 0.1 1.5 5.3 1.2 At 31 December 2016 17.2 11.3 74.8 5.6 32.6 107.7 The deferred tax balance is analysed as follows: Deferred tax 23.8 12.5 5.6 41.9 Deferred tax liability 41.0 1.2 74.8 32.6 149.6 At 31 December 2016 17.2 11.3 74.8 5.6 32.6 107.7 The deferred tax assets in relation to the Visa Europe disposal and the losses have been presented in separate categories from 2016 onwards, resulting in a reclassification of deferred tax balances in the table above.

Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 123 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 2i Deferred tax continued Factors affecting future tax charges Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate were substantively enacted in the year.
The main rate of corporation tax was reduced from 20.0% to 19.0% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 17.0% from 1 April 2020.
Deferred tax on temporary differences and tax losses as at the balance sheet date is calculated at the substantively enacted rates at which the temporary differences and tax losses are expected to reverse.
Note 2j Earnings per share Basic earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to shareholders of Worldpay Group plc by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.
Diluted earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit loss attributable to shareholders of Worldpay Group plc by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive options.
The dilutive effect is calculated on the full exercise of all potentially dilutive ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
When a loss is recognised during a financial period, a basic loss per share rather than a basic earnings per share will be recognised.
The dilutive effects will not be considered in calculating the diluted loss per share as this would reduce the loss per share.
The weighted average number of shares used to determine earnings per share in 2015 have been calculated in accordance with the principle of reverse acquisition accounting.
Underlying basic and diluted earnings per share are included as the Directors believe this provides a better reflection of the Groups performance.

124 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 3 Non-current assets This section shows assets used by the Group to generate revenue and profits.
These assets include customer relationships, brands, computer software and goodwill.
The Groups physical assets are also shown in this section.
Note 3a Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, less any non-controlling interest.
Goodwill is carried at the cost established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any, and is not amortised.
m Cost At 1 January 2015 1,260.9 Acquisition of SecureNet 0.2 Foreign exchange impact 14.2 At 31 December 2015 1,275.3 Foreign exchange impact 61.5 At 31 December 2016 1,336.8 Net book value At 31 December 2016 1,336.8 At 31 December 2015 1,275.3 Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculations are performed at least annually and require the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The corporate planning process includes the preparation of the annual budget as well as the Groups long-term strategic plan.
The strategic plan provides medium to long-term direction for the Group and is reviewed on an annual basis.
It includes a five-year outlook for the business including managements view on the future achievable growth in market share and the capital expenditure required to achieve it.
The cash flows included in the strategic plan are used for the value in use calculations.
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are: CAGR CAGR growth growth rate rate Terminal in sales in costs growth rate Discount rate 31 December 2016 6.1-16.5% 4.6-8.3% 2.0% 8.0-10.0% 31 December 2015 5.3-16.9% 2.6-12.5% 2.0% 8.0-10.0% The growth rates and discount rates for the WPUK and WPUS CGUs are at the lower end of the ranges, with the Global eCom growth rate and discount rate being at the upper end of the ranges.
CAGR is the compound annual growth rate.
The sensitivity of goodwill carrying values to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions has been performed.
No changes produce a significant movement in the carrying value of goodwill allocated to a CGU and therefore no sensitivity analysis is presented.
Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 125 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 3a Goodwill continued Given the low risk of impairment and significant headroom available, the Directors do not believe that the key assumptions by CGU are material to the financial statements and therefore deem it appropriate to disclose the key assumptions at a summary level only.
Should the value in use be lower than the carrying value, the resultant impairment loss is first allocated to goodwill, then to the remaining assets of the CGU pro rata based on their carrying amount.
No asset is impaired below its own recoverable amount.
The impairment loss is recognised immediately in separately disclosed items in the income statement.
Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.
The carrying value of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Global eCom 269.2 267.3 WPUK 716.8 717.5 WPUS 350.8 290.5 1,336.8 1,275.3 Note 3b Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill include brands and customer relationships.
These are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequently, they are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any.
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life.
The estimated useful economic lives and the amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes being accounted for on a prospective basis.
The useful lives applied by the Group are: Customer relationships 3 to 20 years Brands 7 to 10 years Computer software 3 to 10 years The weighted average useful life of customer relationships and brands are 13 years and 8 years respectively.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets.
These costs include directly attributable employee costs.
However, any costs incurred in the research phase or as maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 127 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 3c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment includes terminals, leasehold improvements and computers and office equipment.
Property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at cost.
Cost includes all expenditure directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and working condition for its intended use.
Subsequent measurement of property, plant and equipment is at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that it will give rise to future benefits, i. e. maintenance expenditure is excluded but enhancement costs that meet the criteria are capitalised.
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated to its residual value over its useful life on a straight-line basis.
Estimates of the useful life and residual value, as well as the method of depreciation, are reviewed as a minimum at the end of each reporting period.
Any changes are classified as a change in accounting estimate and so are applied prospectively.
Depreciation rates for each category of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Terminals 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements 5 to 20 years Computers and office equipment 3 to 5 years Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for use and ceases on disposal of the asset, classification as held for sale or the end of its useful life, whichever is the sooner.
The gain or loss on disposal is the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying amount of the asset.

Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 129 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 3c Property, plant and equipment continued Terminals are leased by the Group to third-party merchants under operating leases.

If such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of the asset or its CGU when the asset does not generate largely independent cash flows, is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows from the asset or the CGU, discounted at the appropriate pre-tax rate.
The Group recognises any impairment loss resulting from these reviews in separately disclosed items in the income statement.
Impairment losses, except those arising on goodwill, may be reversed in subsequent periods.
However, the revised carrying value of the asset may not exceed the carrying value had the original impairment not arisen.
An exercise was undertaken to ascertain whether any of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were impaired.
This review determined that there has been no impairment in the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: 2.0m.
130 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 4 Trading assets and liabilities This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
Note 4a Merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors Merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors represent intermediary balances arising in the merchant settlement process.
Merchant float represents surplus cash balances that the Group holds on behalf of its customers, when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes when the funding to customers falls due.
The funds are held in a fiduciary capacity.
They are excluded from the Group cash flow statement to provide greater clarity over the Groups own cash movements.
Scheme debtors consist primarily of: The Groups receivables from the card networks for transactions processed on behalf of customers, where it is a member of that particular network: The Groups receivables from the card networks for transactions where it has by exception funded customers in advance of receipt of card association funding: and Other net receivables from the card networks.
Merchant creditors consist primarily of: The Groups liability to customers for transactions that have been processed but not yet funded by the card franchises, where it is a member of that particular network: The Groups liability to customers for transactions for which it is holding funding from the sponsoring bank under the sponsorship agreement but has not funded customers on behalf of the sponsoring bank: and Merchant reserves and the fair value of the Groups guarantees of cardholder chargebacks.
These are amounts held as deposits from customers, either from inception of Worldpays working relationship with them, or accrued throughout the relationship due to payment issues arising or potential chargebacks.

They are subsequently held at amortised cost, less any provision for bad or doubtful debts.
Provisions for bad or doubtful debts are presented net with the related receivables on the balance sheet.
Trade receivables primarily include amounts due from merchants for services provided to process transactions between the cardholder and an acquiring bank.

Onerous contracts are recognised immediately as a provision.
The amount recognised is the excess of the unavoidable costs of the contract over any expected economic benefits arising from the contract.
Dilapidation provisions represent the liabilities incurred to date in order to restore the leased properties to their original state at the end of the lease terms.
Restructuring provisions are only recognised when there is a detailed plan of the restructure that has been communicated and the proposed restructure is sufficiently imminent to mean that it is unlikely any significant changes will be made to the plan.

Note 5c Borrowings The Group classifies its borrowings between senior bank borrowings and senior unsecured notes.
Both are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised to form part of the cost of that asset.
Capitalisation starts when the asset is actively being built or prepared for use and suspended when developed activities stop.
Interest accruals and other costs related to borrowings are shown as finance costs in the income statement.
The effective interest calculation on senior and subordinated borrowings includes capitalised finance costs.
The Groups borrowings comprise a 248.4m three-year Term Facility Facility 1, a 900m five-year Term Facility Facility 2 and 500m 3.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2022.
The rates of interest on the term facilities are LIBOR based plus a margin dependent on leverage.
The maximum margin for Facility 1 is 2.00% and 2.50% for Facility 2.
The Group also has a 200m revolving credit facility RCF.

Classification depends on the substance of the lease transaction rather than the legal form of the lease agreement.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership lie with the lessee, the lease is classified as a finance lease.
All other arrangements identified as leases are considered to be an operating lease.
Finance leases Where the Group is the lessee of a finance lease, it recognises both the leased asset and a finance lease liability.
The asset is amortised or depreciated over its useful life or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.
The finance lease liability is unwound over the life of the lease at the rate implicit in the lease.
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where an asset is sold to a third party and immediately leased back.
Where the leaseback is a financial lease, the gain or loss is deferred and recognised over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis.
For operating leasebacks, profit or loss is recognised either immediately or over the life of the lease, depending on the values of the sale and lease relative to fair value Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: 2016 2015 Present value Present value Future of minimum Future of minimum minimum lease lease minimum lease lease payments Interest payments payments Interest payments m m m m m m Less than one year 14.9 1.1 13.8 16.1 1.1 15.0 One to five years 19.1 0.6 18.5 14.8 0.6 14.2 34.0 1.7 32.3 30.9 1.7 29.2 Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 137 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 5d Lease arrangements continued The Group entered into leasing arrangements for certain tangible fixed assets in 2016.
The majority of finance leases have a lease term of three years.
For the current financial period the average effective borrowing rate was 4.9% 2015: 5.2%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date and all finance lease obligations are denominated in Sterling.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets.
Operating lease arrangements Operating lease income expense is taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Any lease incentives are spread over the life of the lease.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had obligations to make non-cancellable operating lease payments as follows: 2016 2015 Land and Office Land and Office buildings equipment buildings equipment m m m m Less than one year 19.6 0.1 8.5 0.4 One to five years 61.3 47.7 0.4 After five years 69.2 70.6 Total 150.1 0.1 126.8 0.8 Note 5e Financial instruments On initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are classified into the relevant category and recognised at fair value.
Their subsequent measurement, at either fair value or amortised cost, is dependent upon their initial classification.
Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Individual non-derivatives and their treatment are explained in their separate notes.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset, or the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group operates net investment hedges, using foreign currency borrowings.
The effective portion of the foreign exchange gain or loss on retranslation of the hedging instrument is taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the hedged investment is disposed of then any balance held in reserves is recycled to the income statement.
In the current year, a loss of 21.8m 2015: loss of 8.2m was taken to the foreign exchange reserve in relation to net investment hedging.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in separately disclosed items in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management The Group operates throughout the world, with major operations in the United Kingdom, Europe and the US.
Foreign currency risk is managed at a Group level, focusing on two distinct areas: Group assets and liabilities and customer transactions relating to the Groups payment business.

Where there is a difference in settlement currency, the time between receipt and settlement is generally limited to a small number of days.
Given the short-term nature of these balances there is no material gross credit, liquidity, foreign exchange or market risk associated with them.
Therefore, these balances, i. e. merchant float, scheme debtors and merchant creditors, are excluded from this note.

Cash held at variable rates offsets risk arising from changing interest rates on the Groups borrowings.

An increase of 1.00% in float income arising from cash balances receiving floating rate interest.
The net impacts of the above would be increased costs of 8.3m 2015: 8.6m increase in costs.
The Groups Sterling senior bank debt at 31 December 2016 does not have a floor rate no floor rate as at 31 December 2015. Credit risk management Credit risk arises from the failure of a merchant or partner bank or alternative payments provider to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms.
The Group does not believe it has a material credit risk in relation to amounts owed to us by the card networks as our contracts state we are only liable to settle to merchants on our receipt of those funds.
In circumstances where funds to merchants have been settled prior to receipt of those funds from the card networks a credit risk would arise.
This risk is deemed to be extremely remote as these funds are generally settled within two days and thus it would require the sudden collapse of at least one significant card issuer without any State intervention.
The Group regularly monitors and assesses counterparty and non-performance risk and our most significant network and bank partners are either State owned or have investment grade ratings.
Further information is included in the Principal risks and uncertainties section of this report on page 39.
Liquidity risk management The Groups liquidity risk management focuses on two distinct areas: own cash and settlement cash for customers relating to the Groups payment business.
Own cash The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due.
This is achieved by holding significant cash balances and maintaining sufficient committed headroom.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had own cash balances of 714.4m 2015: 165.3m of which 401.4m is held in relation to CVR holders.
Available headroom under its revolving credit facility is 200.0m 2015: 160.0m.
Settlement cycle The Group has a short-term settlement cycle where card networks predominantly Visa and Mastercard remit cash and the Group pays merchants from these remittances within three days.
The majority of funds are received prior to remittance to the merchant, resulting in significant cash balances relating to the settlement cycle.
The Group has an Intra-Day Agreement Facility of 1.6bn to ensure payments can be processed whilst awaiting card network remittances.

These shares are a liability by nature and therefore are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet and are described in more detail in Note 5i.
On the same day, the Company sub-divided the remaining ordinary shares by reducing the nominal value from 1.00 per share to 0.03 per share.
On 16 October 2015, the Company issued 394,916,667 ordinary shares with a premium of 2.37 per share.
At 31 December 2016, all ordinary shares are fully paid up at par.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to dividends and one vote per share at meetings of the Company.
Note 5g Capital resources The Groups capital consists of equity, comprising issued share capital, share premium, capital contribution and retained earnings.
The regulated entities within the Group are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital.
This ensures the Company has sufficient capital resources for the activities required to undertake payment services.
The capital employed in the Company, together with the reserves, ensure that a buffer to the minimum regulatory capital requirement is achieved.
Note 5h Other equity The Group has introduced a number of share based award schemes in 2016 and 2015 and has purchased its own shares in order to hedge the cash outflow upon the vesting of the schemes.
Details of the awards can be found in Note 2c.
The movement in own shares can be analysed as follows: 2016 2015 2016 2015 Number Number m m At 1 January 9,866,475 23.7 Additions 2,498,333 9,866,475 6.9 23.7 At 31 December 12,364,808 9,866,475 30.6 23.7 During the IPO process in 2015, 31.4m was received from the former parent companies to fund various share award schemes the Group granted.
As part of the Group restructuring in preparation for the IPO in 2015, the Company effected a capital reduction which resulted in a transfer of 818.7m from share premium to retained earnings.
142 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 5 Financing and equity continued Note 5i Visa Europe Disposal of Visa Europe shares On 21 June 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in Visa Europe to Visa Inc. and received a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration valued at 1,051.3m.
The consideration is made up of 589.7m up-front cash, 405.4m of Series B preferred stock in Visa Inc. and 56.2m deferred cash which will be paid in three years.
547.5m of the up-front cash consideration and all of the preferred stock may be reduced by any final settlement of potential liabilities relating to ongoing interchange-related litigation involving Visa Europe.
On disposal of the Visa Europe shares, the Group, along with the other former members of Visa Europe, entered into a Litigation Management Deed LMD.
Under this arrangement, potential losses from Visa Europe interchange litigation will be set against the preferred stock, through adjusting the ratio of conversion to ordinary stock.
A Loss Sharing Agreement LSA entered into by Worldpay, along with the ten other largest UK members of Visa Europe, provides a second level of protection to Visa Inc. capped at the 547.5m of up-front cash consideration.
Contingent Value Rights CVRs The holders of the CVRs a separate class of shares in the Company are entitled to 90% of the net post-tax proceeds of the disposal in accordance with the terms of the CVRs subject to the Companys right of retention, with Worldpay retaining 10% of the net proceeds.
The settlement of the CVR liabilities could take up to 12 years depending on the settlement of the claims under the LSA.
The CVRs are non-voting and are not convertible into ordinary shares.
Given the nature of the CVRs, they are classified as financial liabilities recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, with the gain or loss recognised in Finance costs CVR liabilities in the Groups income statement.
Accounting treatment Visa Europe asset The Visa Europe asset was recognised in the Groups balance sheet at 31 December 2015 as a fair value through profit and loss financial asset.
On disposal, it has been derecognised from the Groups balance sheet with the net gain on disposal recognised in Finance income Visa Europe in the Groups income statement.
Consideration from disposal of Visa Europe shares Own cash and cash equivalents, includes 401.4m in relation to the CVR holders.
The deferred cash consideration has been included in non-current Deferred consideration Visa Europe.
All balances have been revalued to period end rates in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2016.
The preference stock received on disposal of our interest in Visa Europe has been recognised as a financial asset under the non-current Financial assets Visa Inc. preference shares category.
It has been recognised at fair value initially and has been classified as fair value through profit and loss.
Subsequent movements on the fair value of the preferred stock are recognised in Finance income Visa Europe and the movement on the CVR liabilities is recognised in Finance costs CVR liabilities in the Groups income statement.
The value of the Visa Inc. preference shares is based on the expected conversion ratio, which will be adjusted by Visa Inc. based on the potential losses from Visa Europe interchange litigation under the LMD.
Any excess of the potential losses from Visa Europe interchange litigation under the LSA has been included in Provisions within current liabilities.
When measuring the fair values of the financial asset Visa Inc. preference shares as well as the LSA liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Visa Inc. preference shares are classified as Level 3 as the valuation is dependent upon both the value of Visa Inc. ordinary shares, which have a quoted price, and the conversion ratio which will be adjusted for potential losses from Visa Europe interchange litigation under the LMD, for which there are no identical transactions with regularly available market prices.
The LSA liability is classified as Level 3 due to the lack of identical transactions with regularly available market prices.
In order to fair value the Visa Inc. preference shares and the LSA liability as at 31 December 2016, the Directors have considered a range of potential outcomes, including the likely value of the potential level of losses from Visa Europe interchange litigation that the Group may be liable for, and calculated a weighted average.
Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 143 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 5i Visa Europe continued It is reasonably possible that, if the Visa Europe interchange litigation progresses within the next financial year and more information becomes available about the likely value of the potential losses, changes in assumptions determining the fair value could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the Visa Inc. preference shares and the LSA liability.
The uncertainties inherent in the determination of the fair value of the Visa Inc. preference shares and the LSA liability will not be resolved until the obligations under the LMD and LSA are extinguished which is dependent upon final resolution of all related claims.
CVR liabilities The CVR liabilities have been classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost based on a re-estimation of future cash flows, with any changes being recognised in Finance costs CVR liabilities in the income statement.
Conclusion Based on the above, the following has been recognised in the Groups financial statements: 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Balance sheet Non-current assets Deferred consideration Visa Europe 48.0 Financial assets Visa Inc. preference shares 192.1 Current assets Financial assets Visa Europe shares 195.7 Own cash and cash equivalents 446.5 Current liabilities Current tax liabilities 49.4 Provisions 268.5 Financial liabilities CVR liabilities 302.5 140.9 Deferred tax liabilities 32.6 39.2 Net assets 33.6 15.6 Includes 401.4m of cash in relation to the CVR holders.
31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Income statement Finance income Visa Europe shares 195.7 Net gain on disposal of financial assets Visa Europe 207.0 Fair value gain on Visa Inc. preference shares 4.3 Foreign exchange gains 58.6 Dividend income on Visa Inc. preference shares 1.7 Finance costs CVR liabilities 161.7 140.9 Profit before tax 109.9 54.8 Tax 91.9 39.2 Profit after tax 18.0 15.6 Sensitivity analysis The fair value of the Financial assets Visa Inc. preference shares and the LSA provisions are sensitive to the significant unobservable inputs.
At the reporting date a 5% swing in the valuation of the potential losses from Visa Europe interchange litigation under the LMD and the LSA, one of the significant unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant would result in a change in the valuation of the disposal of 22.5m and an impact on profit after tax of 2.5m after adjusting for the change in the CVR liabilities of 20.2m.
144 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Section 6 Group composition subsidiaries, acquisitions and disposals This section shows the Groups subsidiaries, details about subsidiaries the Group has acquired during the year and prior years and details about any subsidiaries that have been disposed of during the year and prior years.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Worldpay Group plc and entities controlled by it its subsidiaries.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of Worldpay Group plc and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
The year end assets and liabilities of the entities are consolidated with those of Worldpay Group plc and presented in the consolidated balance sheet.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the IFRS policies used by the Group and for any fair value adjustments required on consolidation.
All intra-Group balances, income and expenses and the effect of any intra-Group profits on the balance sheet are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Note 6a Investments in subsidiaries An entity is classified as a subsidiary of the Group when the Group has control over that entity, either through majority shareholding or other means.
Acquisitions Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value: it includes cash, other assets transferred and any contingent consideration due to the former owners of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value as at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and any non-controlling interest over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed plus any existing interest in the business acquired.
If the consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the following reporting period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
Disposals When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

15 Level 13, 74 Castlereagh Street, Sydney NSW, 2000 Australia As permitted by s479A of the Companies Act 2006, the Group has taken the advantage of the audit exemption in relation to the individual accounts of these companies.
All significant subsidiary undertakings have 31 December as their financial year ends and all the above companies have been included in the Group consolidation.
The Group also has a joint venture and an investment as disclosed in Note 6b.
Overview Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information 147 Worldpay Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Note 6b Joint venture and associate The joint venture and associate are accounted for using the equity method whereby the interest in the joint venture and associate is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
The Groups income statement includes the Groups share of the profit or loss of the joint venture and associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
Pazien Inc. incorporated in the USA, registered office Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange St. in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, fide 18801.
State of Delaware is an innovative start-up creating products using transaction data to enable more intelligent routing, automated optimisation and reconciliation for Global eCom merchants.
In 2016, the Group increased its share holding in Pazien Inc. to 58.0% 2015: 51.0%.
As we only own 50% of the voting rights we do not have control and so Pazien Inc. is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method in the Groups financial statements.
The table below sets out the aggregated amounts relating to the joint venture and associate: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 5.2 3.2 Additions 2.0 3.2 Share of loss 1.5 1.2 Reclassification to Investment 2.7 Foreign exchange gain 1.3 At 31 December 4.3 5.2 Total assets 1.9 7.6 Total liabilities 0.3 Net assets 1.9 7.3 Group share of net asset 1.1 2.3 Joint venture and associate revenue 0.1 0.2 Loss for the year 2.5 2.8 Group share of joint venture and associate loss for the year 1.5 1.2 Blue Star Sports Holdings, Inc. formerly known as Spay, Inc. is a referral company specialising in the sports sector and was accounted for as an associate until an independent third party invested in this company in 2016.
As a result, the Groups shareholding was reduced to 6.5% from 25.0% and our ability to appoint two Board members was replaced with the entitlement to nominate an observer to the Board.
The investment in Blue Star Sports Holdings, Inc. was therefore reclassified to an investment.
Subsequently a further cash injection was made of 0.6m to avoid further dilution.
At 31 December 2016 the investment in Blue Star Sports Holdings, Inc. is 3.3m.
