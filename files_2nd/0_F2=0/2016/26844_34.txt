Critical accounting estimates and judgements In applying the Companys accounting policies set out in note 2, the Company is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and revised as necessary.
The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these financial statements are described below.
There are no judgements considered to be critical relating to the year.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Investment in subsidiaries At least annually, the Company assesses the carrying value of its investments in subsidiaries, which requires estimates to be made of the value inuse of each entity.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows, long-term growth rates and appropriate discount rates to be applied to future cash flows.
No reasonably foreseeable change in assumptions would cause a significant impairment to be recognised.
Retirement benefit obligations The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
External actuarial advice is taken with regard to the most appropriate assumptions to use.
Further details on these estimates, and sensitivities of the retirement benefit obligations to these estimates, are provided in note 12.

Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in assumptions are provided below: The impact of a50 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2016 to increase by approximately 94.0 million.
The impact of a10 basis point increase in inflation and salary inflation rates would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2016 to increase byapproximately 16.0 million.
The impact of assuming every scheme member were to live for an additional year would cause scheme liabilities at 31 December 2016 toincrease by approximately 29.0 million.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on achange in asingle assumption while keeping all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this isunlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation tosignificant actuarial assumptions, the same method of calculating the defined benefit obligation has been used as when calculating the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysisare consistent with the previous year.
The sensitivity provided in respect of the discount rate has been increased to 50 basis points this year, reflecting the average movement experienced over the last five years.
No change has been considered necessary to other sensitivity levels, given recent past experience.
The weighted average duration of the UK scheme defined benefit obligation is 20.2 years.
