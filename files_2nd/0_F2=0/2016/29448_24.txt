ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING POLICIES These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland FRS 102 and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest 000.
116 These accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
A summary of the material accounting policies adopted are described below.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting policies below.
These financial statements for the period ended 24 April 2016 are the first financial statements of Sports Direct International plc prepared in accordance with FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The date of transition to FRS 102 is 28 April 2014.
An explanation of how transition to FRS 102 has affected the reported financial position and financial performance is given in note 10.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a profit and loss account of the Company is not presented.
The Companys profit after taxation for the 52 week period 24 April 2016 was 42,008,000 2015: 8,941,000.
As permitted by FRS 102 the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to financial instruments, presentation of a cash flow statement, share-based payments, the aggregate remuneration of key management personnel and related party transactions with other wholly-owned members of the group.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the group accounts of Sports Direct International plc.
INVESTMENTS Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
The company has elected to designate listed investments as available-for-sale financial assets as at the date of transition.
Under previous UK GAAP listed investments were held at cost less impairment.
The company has elected to follow the requirements of IAS 39, as permitted by FRS 102 Section 12, and the fair value from one period to another being shown within the statement of other comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recognised at fair value.
Where fair value is different to cost, this is recognised in the income statement on initial recognition.
Subsequent gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
When the security is disposed of, fide-recognised or is determined to be impaired the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the profit and loss account as a reclassification adjustment within other income.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs less provision for impairment.
Provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST An Employee Benefit Trust has been established for the purposes of satisfying certain share-based awards.
The Group has fide facto control over the special purpose entity.
The Trust is fully consolidated within the accounts.
The cost of shares acquired by the Sports Direct Employee Benefit Trust is recognised within Own share-reserve in equity.
DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
No timing differences are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
A deferred tax asset is not recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit in future is more unlikely than not.
Deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES Items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
At the balance sheet date all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate or at the rate of exchange at which the transaction is contracted to be settled in the future.
All exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account.
DIVIDENDS Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the Companys Financial Statements, and as a deduction from equity, in the period in which the dividends are declared.
Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of the Companys shareholders, the dividends are only declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company, with the exception of those accounted for via merger relief available under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
INCOME FROM GROUP UNDERTAKINGS 117 Income from Group undertakings is recognised when qualifying consideration is received from the Group undertaking.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 102 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with wholly-owned subsidiaries which form part of the Group.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The fair value of the share options on the date of the grant is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the share option, based on the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
A corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
At each balance sheet date the company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and recognises the impact of any revision of original estimates in the profit and loss account.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A share-based payment charge of 7,077,000 was recognised for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 based on the Directors best estimate of the number of shares that will vest.
6,934,000 of this share-based payment was recharged to subsidiary undertakings of the Company.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS In the application of the companys accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods.
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are outlined below.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CALCULATION OF SHARE SCHEME CHARGE: A share based payment charge is recognised in respect of share awards based on the directors best estimate of the numbers of shares that will vest.
The charge is calculated based on the fair value of the grant date, which is deemed to be the date on which the entity and counterparty reached a shared understanding of the scheme.
ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO TAX Management estimation is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities that can be recognised, based upon likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 10.
FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF FRS 102 The company transitioned to FRS 102 from UK GAAP as at 28 April 2014.
The estimates at 28 April 2014 and 26 April 2015 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with UK GAAP after adjustments to reflect any differences to accounting policies.
The impact from transition to FRS 102 is set out below.

Under previous UK GAAP this was not a requirement.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments for purchase and sale of equity instruments is now recognised on the balance sheet with the movement in fair value from one period to another being shown in the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities have not been offset within the financial statements, and are presented with the debtors and creditors.
B The company has elected to not follow the accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments for tax purposes.
This causes a temporary difference between accounting and taxable profits.
As a result a deferred tax liability asset is recognised.
