API gravity The industry standard method of expressing specific density of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons as recommended by the American Petroleum Institute.
Higher API gravities mean lower specific gravity and lighter oils.
When the API gravity is greater than 10, the product is lighter and floats on water: if it is less than 10, it is heavier than water and sinks.
Generally speaking, oil with an API gravity between 40and 45 commands the highest prices.
