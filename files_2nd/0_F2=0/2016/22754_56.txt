Retirement benefit liabilities The table below summarises the Groups net year end post-employment liabilities and activity for the year.
2016 2015 m m Balance sheet obligations for: Defined pension benefits 130.3 62.8 Post-employment medical benefits 16.2 16.0 146.5 78.8 Income statement charge included in profit before tax for: Defined pension benefits 15.9 18.2 Post-employment medical benefits 1.2 1.1 17.1 19.3 Remeasurements included in other comprehensive expense income for: Defined pension benefits 69.2 32.1 Post-employment medical benefits 3.7 1.5 65.5 33.6 Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, US and several other territories under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
Following changes to the UK pension scheme during the current year, all of the Groups final salary type pension schemes which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life based on salary in the final years leading up to retirement are now closed to future service accrual with the exception of a small number of grandfathered employees in the US scheme.
The UK scheme operated on a final salary basis until the 5 April 2016, following which the scheme changed to a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE defined benefit scheme, with annual pensionable earnings capped at 65,000 and indexation of pensions in payment based on CPI previously RPI, for service accrued from 6 April 2016.
This change is expected to reduce the future comparable cost and risk attached to the UK scheme.
Material defined benefit pension schemes in other territories operate on a similar basis to the UK, except in the US, which other than for grandfathered employees operates a cash balance pension scheme that provides a guaranteed rate of return on pension contributions until retirement.
The US plans also do not generally receive inflationary increases once in payment.
With the exception of this difference in inflationary risk, the Groups main defined benefit pension schemes continue to face broadly similar risks, as described on page 107.
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds: however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where therelevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between theGroup and the trustees or equivalent and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules predominantly lies with the particular schemes board of trustees with appropriate input from the relevant Group company.
Theboard of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each schemes regulations and any relevant legislation.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of these schemes are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Present value of funded obligations UK pension scheme 1,036.1 784.1 US pension scheme 135.7 112.2 Rest of World 183.6 131.1 1,355.4 1,027.4 Fair value of schemes assets UK pension scheme 956.4 767.1 US pension scheme 126.3 94.2 Rest of World 146.7 108.3 1,229.4 969.6 Net liability in respect of funded schemes 126.0 57.8 Present value of unfunded obligations 4.3 5.0 Liability in Group balance sheet excluding post-employment medical benefits 130.3 62.8 Croda International Plc 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements 2016 2015 m m Movement in present value of retirement benefit obligations in the year: Opening balance 1,032.4 1,057.3 Current service cost 14.1 15.6 Interest cost 37.4 35.8 Remeasurements Change in demographic assumptions 0.7 15.8 Change in financial assumptions 272.5 31.9 Experience gains losses 7.5 3.0 Contributions paid in Employee 2.6 2.7 Benefits paid 38.6 34.7 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 47.5 0.4 1,359.7 1,032.4 Movement in fair value of schemes assets in the year: Opening balance 969.6 946.5 Interest income 35.6 33.1 Remeasurements Return on scheme assets, excluding amounts included in financial expenses 195.1 12.6 Contributions paid in Employee 2.6 2.7 Employer 25.1 34.7 Benefits paid out including settlements 38.6 34.7 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 40.0 0.1 1,229.4 969.6 As at the balance sheet date, the present value of retirement benefit obligations was comprised of approximately 414m in respect of active employees, 385m in respect of deferred members and 561m in relation to members in retirement.
Total employer contributions to the schemes in 2017 are expected to be 12.5m.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 UK US UK US Discount rate 2.6% 4.0% 3.8% 4.3% Inflation rate RPI 3.3% 2.5% 3.1% 2.5% Inflation rate CPI 2.3% n a 2.1% n a Rate of increase in salaries 4.3% 4.0% 4.1% 4.0% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.1% n a 2.9% n a Duration of liabilities ie life expectancy years 20.5 11.5 18.5 11.7 Remaining working life 15.8 11.1 15.8 11.2 Croda International Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 105 Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Accounts 11.
Retirement benefit liabilities continued The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions is as follows: Impact on retirement benefit obligation Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease Discount rate 0.5% 9.2% 10.7% Inflation rate 0.5% 6.3% 6.2% Mortality assume all scheme members one year younger 1 year 3.0% n a The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, thisisunlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated withthe projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19.9 years 2015: 18.2 years.

The method of accounting, significant assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes set out above with theaddition of actuarial assumptions relating to the long term increase in health care costs of 8.0% a year 2015: 8.4%.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of this scheme are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Present value of unfunded obligations US scheme 16.2 16.0 2016 2015 m m Movement in present value of retirement benefit obligations in the year: Opening balance 16.0 15.9 Current service cost 0.5 0.5 Interest cost 0.7 0.6 Remeasurements Change in demographic assumptions 0.2 Change in financial assumptions 2.0 0.4 Experience gains 1.5 1.1 Benefits paid 0.4 0.4 Exchange differences on overseas schemes 3.1 0.9 16.2 16.0 Croda International Plc 106 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Pension and medical benefits risks and volatility Through its defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment medical schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, themost significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The schemes liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if scheme assets underperform this yield, a deficit will be created.
Both the UK and US plans hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
Whilst our Dutch scheme is less mature, regulatory pressures result in lower equity holdings.
As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
However, the Group and the pension trustees Trustees believe that due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently.
See below for more details on the Groups asset-liability matching strategy.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value oftheschemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
However, the level of inflationary increases are usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase the deficit.
In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes liabilities.
This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching ALM framework that has been developed to achieve long term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes.
Within this framework, the Groups ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.
The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations.
The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous years.
As part of these processes, the Group increased the proportion of assets in its UK liability driven investment portfolio during the year by approximately 9%.
Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
A large portion of assets in 2016 consist of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and infrastructure funds.
The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
Both the UK and Dutch schemes make use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk.
The triennial valuation of the UK scheme was completed as at 30 September 2014.
The results showed that the actuarial scheme deficit had been eliminated following the last deficit payment of 22m in January 2015.
As a result, no deficit funding payments to this scheme will be required prior to the next triennial valuation due as at September 2017.
The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually.
As at 31 December 2015 the scheme was 123% funded, with the funding level allowing for contributions to be received during 2016.
The Groups Dutch scheme is subject to a more rigorous regulatory environment under the supervision of the Dutch National Bank DNB.
As at 31 December 2016 the scheme was 104% funded on an actuarial basis relative to the DNBs required level of 123% and a minimum funding requirement of 104%.
