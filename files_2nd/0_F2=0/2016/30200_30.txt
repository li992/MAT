Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Section 4: Financial position Section 4 contains financial statement notes that relate to the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2016, along with the relevant accounting policies.
4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the cash generating units CGUs may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates.
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a CGU level, consisting of the three business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are 7 CGUs at 31 December 2016 2015: 11 CGUs.
The reduction in CGUs in 2016 is due to the sale of PR Newswire and the integration of UBM Advanstar into UBM Americas.
For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.

Impairment tests for goodwill For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the carrying amount of each CGU has been compared with its estimated value in use.
The following key assumptions were used by management in the value in use calculations: Pre-tax Perpetuity discount growth rate rate % % Cash flow forecasts Events 2016: 11.2 11.7 2016: 2.4 2.7 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow with continued 2015: 12.0 14.0 2015: 1.8 2.5 focus on Events First strategy and organic growth in major events.

Marketing Services Print 2016: 10.4 2016: 2.9 Continued rationalisation and optimisation of the print portfolio 2015: 12.0 14.0 2015: 0 1.5 and anticipated a continued decline in print revenues over the forecast period with further non-core titles either closed or sold, expected to result in stabilisation of print margins.
Forecast cash flows For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first three years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The forecast cash flows are based on assumptions that reflect past experience, forward booking indicators, long term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates see above.
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows beyond the first three years are based upon the weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2019 of each of the territories in which the CGUs operate.
Growth rates for each territory have been based on contribution to 2017 budgeted adjusted operating profit 2015: contribution to 2016 budgeted revenue.
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation range from -2.9% to 3.1% 2015: 0% to 2.5% depending on the territories and industries in which each CGU operates.
Discount rate The discount rate for each CGU is based on a blended model of the current yield on long term government bonds and longer term expected yields, the systemic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates.
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the whole market.
The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market risk premiums.
134 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 4.1 Goodwill continued The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted.
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors.
Sensitivities Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amount of UBM Americas Print is not significantly higher than its carrying amount.
The table below shows the goodwill of the CGU, the amount by which the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds the carrying amount the headroom and the reasonably possible percentage changes needed in isolation in each of the key assumptions that would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount.
The cash flow forecasts for 2016 is expressed as the compound average growth rate used for the impairment testing.

Consequently, any adverse change in key assumption would have, in isolation, caused a further impairment loss of other assets to be recognised.
4.2 Intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets acquired separately including website development costs relating to the application and infrastructure development, graphical design and content development stages incurred with third parties are measured on initial recognition at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for acquisitions Note 6.1 and measured on initial recognition at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, that do not qualify for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense.
All research costs are expensed as incurred.
At each reporting date, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives as follows: Trademarks brands 5-15 years Software 5-7 years Customer contracts and relationships 1-10 years Subscription lists 2-5 years Databases 2-10 years Website development costs 3 years Useful lives are re-examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The amortisation of internally generated or purchased software and website development costs is included in operating expenses in the income statement.
The amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions is included as a separate line item in the income statement as it does not relate to operating activities.

The average remaining useful lives for the other classes of intangible assets is 5 years 2015: 6 years.
4.3 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to the residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 5-20 years Computer equipment 3-5 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the item is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

The amounts recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management.
Reorganisation and restructuring The provision mainly relates to the remaining severance payments to be made in relation to the restructuring of the UBM Americas business and the Advanstar integration.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next 12 months.
Vacant properties The provisions relate to obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property.
The quantification of the provisions depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties.
The provisions also relate to obligations in respect of dilapidations on leasehold properties.
The quantification of these provisions are dependent on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provisions at 31 December 2016 have been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases, which range from one to five years.
The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
Liabilities relating to disposals The provisions relate to obligations arising from warranty and other claims brought against the Group in relation to disposed businesses over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.
The increase in the provision is primarily due to the disposal of PR Newswire during 2016.
The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group.
