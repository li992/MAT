This is as a result of restructuring activities extended beyond the original scope, as well as two further property transactions where the Group regained sole ownership of stores and distribution centres.
a Following an evaluation of the cash-generating unit for technology and associated fixed assets principally relating to online general merchandise, impairment charges and write-offs of 275m have been recorded as the Group moves toward a single online platform for customers.
In addition, a net property, plant and equipment PPE impairment and onerous lease charge of 133m has arisen, including write downs on construction in progress and non-trading sites of 109m.
Refer to Notes 10 and 11 for further details on impairment and Note 24 for further details on onerous lease provisions.
b A net charge of 126m has been recognised as restructuring and redundancy costs in the UK & ROI.
This includes 89m relating to store colleague structures and working practices and 34m relating to head office restructuring costs, partly offset by a provision release of 74m related to the prior year changes to store colleague working arrangements.
In addition, there have been costs of 77m related to business rationalisation including the closure of UK Homeplus stores.
These costs include impairment of PPE, goodwill and onerous lease provisions.
c In line with the Groups strategy to strengthen its balance sheet, the Group has taken sole control of 70 stores and two distribution centres previously held in three joint ventures, whilst selling its interests in two property joint ventures, as discussed in Note 13 and Note 30.
The Group has also disposed of 12 development sites in London.
d As a result of the closure of the UK defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme, all active members of the Scheme became deferred members.
The rate at which previously accrued benefits grow until retirement differs for active and deferred members.
The rate of increase for deferred members aligns with the consumer price index and resulted in an actuarial credit of 538m.
This credit was offset by one-off payments of 58m relating to auto-enrolment and top-up payments to the new defined contribution scheme for some colleagues previously in the defined benefit scheme.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 101 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 4 Exceptional items continued e The Group holds 2.5bn of proceeds from the sale of the Korean operations in GBP money market funds in an intermediate entity with a Euro functional currency.
The 220m loss represents foreign exchange losses arising on the revaluation of these sterling-denominated funds into Euros.
The loss does not represent an economic loss to the Group since there is an offset within other comprehensive income.
f In agreeing tax liabilities for past years up to 2011, the Group has identified provisions of 86m held for uncertain tax positions which are no longer required.
g O n 22 October 2015, the Group completed its sale of its Korea operations, made up of Homeplus Co. Limited, Homeplus Tesco Co.
