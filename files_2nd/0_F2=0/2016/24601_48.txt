Other deferred tax assets of 5.7 million 2015: 6.0 million arise in the other jurisdictions primarily Australia in which the Group operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which they reverse.
The date enacted or substantively enacted for the relevant periods of reversal are: 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020 in the UK 2015: 19% and 30% in Australia.
In March 2016, the United Kingdom Government announced a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
The reduction to 17% has not been substantively enacted and has therefore not been reflected in the figures above.
The impact of the future rate reduction will be accounted for to the extent that it is enacted at future balance sheet dates: however it is estimated that this will not have a material impact on the Group.
