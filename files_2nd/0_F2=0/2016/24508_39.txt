Notes to the Company Accounts Notes to the Company Accounts C1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared on the historical cost basis, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments at fair value as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
Information on the impact of first-time adoption of FRS 101 is given in note C14.
First time application of FRS 100 and FRS 101 In the current year the Company has adopted FRS 100 and FRS 101.
In previous years the financial statements were prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
This change in the basis of preparation has not materially altered the recognition and measurement requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP, other than the accounting for the Company pension plan see note C14.
Consequently the principal accounting policies are otherwise unchanged from the prior year.
On the change in the basis of preparation, the Company has taken advantage of all of the available disclosure exemptions in the financial statements permitted by FRS 101.
The most significant disclosure exemptions are summarised below.
There have been no other material amendments to the disclosure requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP.
As required by FRS 101, the comparatives have been restated.
Financial reporting standard 101 reduced disclosure exemptions The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: the requirements of paragraphs 45 b and 46-52 of IFRS 2 Share based payment: the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: paragraph 73 e of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible Assets: the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134-136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: and the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Companys accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The most significant area of estimate is determining whether there is impairment of the Companys investments which requires estimation of the investments values in use.
The value in use calculation requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and apply suitable discount rates in order to calculate present values.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Deferred tax The recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent on assessments of future taxable income.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Profit and Loss Account.
Financial Instruments The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the instrument.
Financial instruments are fide-recognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire.
The Company's accounting policies in respect of financial instruments transactions are explained below: 162 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 160 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Company Accounts continued C1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Financial assets The Company recognises its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
Other than the financial assets in a qualifying hedging relationship, the Company's accounting policy for each category is as follows: Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives.
These are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers e. g. trade receivables, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the Profit and Loss Account.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collected, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities The Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired.
Fair value through profit or loss These comprise only out-of-the-money derivatives.
They are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
At amortised cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost including bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Share-based payments The Company has adopted IFRS 2 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Groups policy.
This policy is shown on page 115.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its estimated life.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Freehold property 2% Plant, equipment and vehicles 8% to 33.3% Leases The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 163 161 Notes to the Company Accounts continued C1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Pensions The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they become payable.
The Company also operates a Group-wide defined benefit pension plan.
For defined benefit plans, the asset or liability recorded in the Company Balance Sheet is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for the plan on an annual basis by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur, and are taken to other comprehensive income.
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of settlements or curtailments, are charged to profit and loss.
The unwinding of the discounting on the net liability is recognised within finance income or expense as appropriate.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable, on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their corresponding tax bases.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is considered more likely than not on the basis of all available evidence.

172 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 170 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C14 EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO FRS 101 Reconciliation of Shareholders funds 29 March 28 March 2014 2015 Note 000 000 Shareholders funds reported under previous GAAP 360,028 408,775 Adjustments to equity on transition to FRS 101: I Reinstatement of retirement benefit obligation 26,028 46,741 II Deferred tax asset on retirement benefit obligation 5,256 9,344 III Excess tax on share-based payment transactions Shareholders funds reported under FRS 101 339,256 371,378 I Retirement benefit obligation Under UK GAAP FRS 17, as the defined benefit plan was a multi-employer scheme and the Company was unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities, the plan was accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, recognising only the contribution payable by the Company.
Under FRS 101 the multi-employer exemption is no longer available.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost within the Group amongst the participating companies.
Therefore the Company, as the sponsoring employer, has recognised the full defined benefit plans net obligation on the Company Balance Sheet.
None of the net obligation is, or was, recognised on the individual Balance Sheet of any other UK company within the Group.
The impact has been to increase Creditors falling due after more than one year at 30 March 2014 by 26,028,000 and at 29 March 2015 by 46,741,000.
As prescribed under FRS 101 any actuarial gains and losses are recognised through the Company Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure.
In 2015 actuarial losses of 25,080,000 were recognised.
II A deferred tax asset of 5,256,000 relating to the retirement benefit obligation was recognised on the Company Balance Sheet at the transition to FRS 101.
This results in an increase in the Profit and Loss Account reserve by 5,256,000.
The increase in the pension plan obligation during 2015, as described above, has given rise to an increase in the corresponding deferred tax asset from 5,256,000 to 9,344,000 and has increased the Profit and Loss Account reserve by a further 4,088,000.
III Under UK GAAP current and deferred tax relating to share-based payment transactions is taken to profit or loss in full.
Under FRS 101, current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss for the year to the extent it relates to the share based payment charge recognised.
It is taken to equity where it exceeds the related cumulative share-based payment charge.
This results in a reduction in the profit for 2015 of 534,000 but does not change the reported equity.
Reconciliation of profit for the year ending 28 March 2015 In accordance with the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own Profit and Loss Account.
As a result of the adjustments noted above, the transition to FRS 101 has increased the profit after tax for 2015 by 2,917,000, comprising 3,451,000 increase relating to the net impact of reinstating the defined benefit obligation and 534,000 decrease relating to the treatment of current and deferred tax in relation to share-based payments.
Presentation of software in the Company Balance Sheet Previously under UK GAAP, software was presented within tangible assets.
Under FRS 101, this is classified as an intangible asset.
There is no change in the value ascribed to the software asset.

IFRS figures include results of operations up to the date of their sales or closure but exclude material discontinued and continuing profits on sales or closures of operations.
In 2013 14 only, the effects of closure to future benefit accrual of the defined benefit pension plans have also been removed.

See note 3 to the Report and Accounts for the definitions of ROCE and ROTIC.
The ROCE and ROTIC measures were restated in 2014 15 and for all prior years to use an average Capital Employed and Total Invested Capital respectively.
This measure is considered to be more representative.
IAS 19 as revised in June 2011 Employee Benefits was adopted by the Group in 2013 14.
To aid comparison, and as required by IAS 19 revised, the Consolidated Financial Statements and affected notes for 2012 13 were restated as if IAS 19 revised had always applied during that year.
Results prior to 2012 13 were not restated.
