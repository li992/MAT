NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated Financial Statements of Sports Direct International plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRSIC and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union.
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include fair valuation of certain financial assets and derivative financial instruments.
CONSOLIDATION The consolidated Financial Statements consolidate the revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries, being those entities that the Group is deemed to have control over.
It will be deemed to have control when it has power over the entity, is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from the entity and has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the entitys returns.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of fair value of consideration transferred below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period of acquisition.
The non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Costs incurred relating to acquisitions are expensed to the income statement.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
ASSOCIATES Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
The Groups share of the results of associates is included in the Groups consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associates and joint ventures, less any impairment in value.
The carrying values of investments in associates include acquired goodwill.
74 If the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
INVESTMENTS Available-for-sale investments are initially recognised at fair value.
Where fair value is different to cost, this is recognised in the income statement on initial recognition.
Subsequent gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.
When the security is disposed of, fide-recognised or is determined to be impaired the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment within other comprehensive income.
ACQUISITIONS For business combinations achieved in stages, the Group re-measures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition date fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss, if any, in the income statement as appropriate.
GOODWILL Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when a change in circumstances or situation indicates that the goodwill has suffered an impairment loss.
The need for impairment is tested by comparing the market value of the cash-generating unit CGU to the carrying value.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the amount of goodwill relating to that business.
When the non-controlling interest of an existing subsidiary is acquired the carrying value of the non-controlling interests in the balance sheet is eliminated.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid is recognised directly in equity.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Brands, trade marks and licences that are internally generated are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Acquired brands, trade marks and licences are initially carried on the balance sheet at cost.
The fair value of brands, trade marks and licences that are acquired by virtue of a business combination is determined at the date of acquisition and is subsequently assessed as being the deemed cost to the Group.
Expenditure on advertising and promotional activities is recognised as an expense as incurred.
No amortisation is charged on those brands, trade marks or perpetual renewable licences with an indefinite life as the Group believes that the value of these brands and trade marks can be maintained indefinitely.
The Group carries out an impairment review of indefinite life intangibles, at least annually, or when a change in circumstances or situation indicates that those intangibles have suffered an impairment loss.
Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset as part of the CGU with the recoverable amount of the CGU, that is, the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is calculated by using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Amortisation is provided on other brands, trade marks and licences with a definite life on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives of 5 to 15 years and is accounted for within the selling, distribution and administrative expenses category within the income statement.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation less any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably.
All other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs, are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and is calculated on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis, whichever is deemed by the directors to be more appropriate, to allocate cost less assessed residual value, other than assets in the course of construction, over the estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings - between 4% and 10% per annum - straight line Leasehold improvements - over the term of the lease - straight line Plant and equipment - between 5% and 33% per annum - straight line The assets useful lives and residual values are reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted at each balance sheet date.
The gain or loss arising on disposal or scrapping of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, net of selling costs, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, 75 if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
With respect to property, plant and equipment, each store is considered to be a CGU and where onerous leases are noted the assets of each individual store are individually assessed for impairment.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Impairment losses recognised for CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill.
Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the CGU.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset CGU in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
In the case of goods sold through retail stores, revenue is recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer, less provision for returns.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the sale.
Retail sales are usually in cash, by debit card or by credit card.
In the case of goods sold on the internet revenue is recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which is the point of delivery to the customer.
Transactions are settled by credit card or payment card.
Provisions are made for internet credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
In the case of goods sold to other businesses via wholesale channels, revenue is recognised when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer.
In the case of income generated from trade marks and licences, revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant agreements or on a transactional basis when revenue is linked to sale or purchase volumes.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those significant items of income and expense which, because of their size, nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and assess trends in financial performance more readily.
INTEREST INCOME Interest income is reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES The presentational currency of the Group is sterling.
The functional currency of the Company is also sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences of the Company arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of these subsidiary undertakings are translated at average rates applicable in the period.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and documented in a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences that have been recognised as a separate component of equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement when disposal is recognised.
In order to mitigate its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see Chief Executives report and the cash flow hedging accounting policy on page 78.
INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes the purchase price of the manufactured products, materials, direct labour, transport costs and a proportion of applicable overheads.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method.
76 Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less all estimated selling costs.
The Company receives trade discounts and rebates from suppliers based upon the volume of orders placed in a given time window.
Where there is sufficient certainty that a discount or rebate will be received in the future that relates to historic purchases this is reflected in the cost of inventories.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost under the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
TAXATION Tax expense comprises of current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred taxation is calculated using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated Financial Statements.
However, if the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate to items that are recorded in other comprehensive income or charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged to other comprehensive income or credited directly to equity.
PENSIONS The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of certain employees, including both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
In relation to its defined contribution plans, the Group makes contributions to independently administered plans, the contributions being recognised as an expense when they fall due.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make any further payments to the plans other than the contributions due.
In relation to its defined benefit schemes, the Group recognises in its balance sheet the present value of its defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets.
The current service cost is charged against operating profit.
Interest on the schemes liabilities is included in finance costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated at each period end by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
BORROWINGS AND BORROWING COSTS Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs, being interest and other costs incurred in connection with the servicing of borrowings, are recognised as an expense when incurred.
PROVISIONS A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
77 The Group provides for its legal responsibility for dilapidation costs following advice from chartered surveyors and previous experience of exit costs.
The estimated cost of fulfilling the leasehold dilapidations obligations is discounted to present value and analysed between non-capital and capital components.
The capital element is recognised as a decommissioning cost and depreciated over the life of the asset.
The non-capital element is taken to the income statement in the first year of the lease where the cost it represents is of no lasting benefit to the Group or its landlord.
Wear and tear costs are expensed to the income statement.
Provisions for onerous lease contracts are recognised when the Group believes the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.
Other provisions relate to restructuring and employment related costs.
LEASES Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The asset subject to the finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included as a liability.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group does not have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Incentives provided by the lessor are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term.
Contingent rental payments, above standard payments, are conditional on the Groups operating performance derived from the lease item, e. g. turnover levels.
These are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Rental income from operating leases where the Group acts as a lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases and sales made in foreign currencies, principally the US Dollar and Euro.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on re-measurement are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Written option contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and fair value movements are recognised directly in the income statement.
CASH FLOW HEDGING Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
The effective element of any gain or loss from re-measuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the profit or loss.
The classification of the effective portion when recognised in the income statement is the same as the classification of the hedged transaction.
Any element of the re-measurement of the derivative instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement within finance income or costs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment.
TREASURY SHARES The purchase price of the Groups own shares that it acquires is recognised as Treasury shares within equity.
When shares are transferred out of treasury the difference between the market value and the average purchase price of shares sold out of treasury is transferred to 78 retained earnings.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST An Employee Benefit Trust has been established for the purposes of satisfying certain share-based awards.
The Group has fide-facto control over the special purpose entity.
This Trust is fully consolidated within the accounts.
The cost of shares acquired by the Sports Direct Employee Benefit Trust is recognised within own share-reserve in equity.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors and employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is expensed to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with the corresponding credit going to equity.
Non market vesting conditions are not taken into account in determining grant date fair value.
Instead, they are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments to vest.
Fair value is based on the market share price on the grant date.
The expected staff numbers used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A share-based payment charge of 7.1m was recognised in selling, distribution and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016.
The key details in respect of the share scheme charges are set out in note 21.
The credit for the share based payment charge does not equal the charge per the income statement as it excludes amounts recognised in the balance sheet in relation to the expected national insurance contributions for the shares.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
DIVIDENDS Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups Financial Statements and as a deduction from equity in the period in which the dividends are declared.
Where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of shareholders, the dividends are regarded as declared once shareholder approval has been obtained.
MATERIALITY In preparing the Financial Statements, the Board considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in forming its judgements, and related disclosures, and are mindful of the need to best serve the interests of its stakeholders and to avoid unnecessary clutter borne of the disclosure of immaterial items.
In making this assessment the Board considers the nature of each item, as well as its size, in assessing whether any disclosure omissions or misstatements could influence the decisions of users of the Financial Statements.
The Board has applied a typical materiality threshold of 5% of the underlying EBITDA, the Groups primary profit measure, in order to calculate materiality levels.
For the Financial Year ended 24 April 2016, the current year EBITDA of 381.4m gives a materiality level for FY16 of 19.1m.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS STANDARDS IN ISSUE BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE At the date of authorisation of these consolidated Financial Statements, the international accounting standards board IASB and international financial reporting standards committee IFRSC have issued the following standards and interpretations which are effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date.
These standards and interpretations are not effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of the consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IASB effective date 1 January 2018 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts effective date 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2017 IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 IASB effective date 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements effective 1 January 2016 Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements effective 1 January 2016 The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group, except for IFRS 16, which will result in operating leases being recognised within assets on the Balance Sheet and a corresponding liability.
For current operating lease information see note 31.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The critical accounting estimates and judgements made by the Group regarding the future or other key sources of estimation, uncertainty and judgement that may have a significant risk of giving rise to a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL The calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill requires a comparison of the present value of the CGUs 79 to which the goodwill has been allocated to the value of goodwill and associated assets in the balance sheet.
The calculation of present values requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review of goodwill are set out in note 15.
IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of other intangible assets with an indefinite life, specifically brands, trade marks and licences, requires a comparison of the present value of the related cash flows to the value of the other intangible assets in the balance sheet.
The calculation of present value requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the other intangible assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review of other intangible assets are set out in note 15.
USEFUL ECONOMIC LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS For intangible assets which have a finite life, the directors revisit their estimate of useful economic life at each period end and revise accordingly.
Licences and trade marks typically have a life of between 5 and 15 years.
IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION OF ACQUIRED ASSETS On acquisition, each material, separable asset is identified and valued by the Directors.
Any such calculation is judgemental in nature as it is based on a valuation methodology.
Brand valuations are typically valued using the relief from royalty valuation methodology.
Property valuations are typically valued based on realisable value.
The nature and carrying amounts of these assets are set out in note 29.
IMPAIRMENT The Directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
PROVISION FOR OBSOLETE, SLOW MOVING OR DEFECTIVE INVENTORIES The Directors have applied their knowledge and experience of the retail industry in determining the level and rates of provisioning required in calculating the appropriate inventory carrying values.
The provision includes estimates for shrinkage, spoilage and slow-moving items depending on the age and current selling prices of the individual stock items.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 FINANCIAL POSITION OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS The net defined benefit pension plan assets or liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
The determination of the financial position requires assumptions to be made regarding inter alia future salary increases, mortality, discount rates and inflation.
The key assumptions made in relation to the pension plan are set out in note 24.
PROVISION FOR DILAPIDATIONS AND ONEROUS LEASE CONTRACTS The basis of the estimation of the provisioning for dilapidations and onerous lease contracts is detailed in the provisions accounting policy and note 26.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience, external advice and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Where an onerous lease has been identified, the assets dedicated to that contract are impaired.
CALCULATION OF SHARE SCHEME CHARGE A share-based payment charge is recognised in respect of share awards based on the Directors best estimate of the number of shares that will vest.
The charge is calculated based on the fair value on the grant date, which is deemed to be the date on which the entity and counterparty reached a shared understanding of the scheme.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS Where market data is not available to assist in valuing investments, management estimate the fair value of the enterprise based on the current performance and financial position of the relevant company.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups current activities result in the following financial risks and set out below are managements responses to those risks in order to minimise any resulting adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via: a. Transactional exposure from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the income statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 27. b. Transactional exposure from sale of goods, where those sales are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the selling company.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in 80 note 27. c. Net investment exposure, from the fair value of net investments outside the UK.
The Group hedges its international investments via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies.
d. Loans to non-UK subsidiaries.
These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
e. Exposures in respect of written options to sell Euros as explained in the Financial Review.
These are not hedged and movements in fair value could significantly impact the profit and loss account in future periods.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Group has net borrowings, which are principally at floating interest rates linked to bank base rates or LIBOR.
The Group does not currently use interest rate financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group regularly monitors and reacts accordingly to any exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the impact on its monetary assets and liabilities.
CREDIT RISK The Directors have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an on-going basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At each balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
LIQUIDITY RISK The availability of adequate cash resources is managed by the Group through utilisation of its revolving credit facilities together with equity and retained profits thereby achieving continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT A description of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are included in note 27.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS IFRS 8 - operating segments requires the Groups segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess performance and allocate resources across each operating segment.
The Directors have reviewed the markets for UK sports retail and international sports retail and are satisfied that these display similar economic characteristics and that these are therefore correctly reported as one segment.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Executive Directors and the operating segments are identified as the store fascia or brand, in line with the internal reporting to the Executive Directors.
Sales and gross profit for each operating segment, as well as underlying EBITDA, are the main measures used by the Executive Directors to assess performance.
In accordance with paragraph 12 of IFRS 8 the Groups operating segments have been aggregated into the following reportable segments: Sports Retail includes the results of the UK and International retail network of sports stores along with related websites: Premium Lifestyle includes the results of the premium retail businesses such as Cruise, Flannels and USC: and Brands includes the results of the Groups portfolio of internationally recognised brands such as Everlast, Lonsdale and Dunlop.
Information regarding the Groups reportable segments for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016, as well as a reconciliation of reported profit for the period to underlying EBITDA, is presented on pages 18 to 23.

Underlying earnings is used by management as a measure of profitability within the Group.
Underlying earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent for each financial period but excluding the post tax effect of certain non-trading items.
Tax has been calculated with reference to the effective rate of tax for the Group.
The Directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
Underlying earnings is not a recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 15.
The carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to the Groups operating segments before aggregation.
With the exception of Everlast, none of the individual cash-generating units CGUs are considered material to goodwill or indefinite life intangibles Brands.
The carrying value of goodwill and brands allocated to the Groups CGUs, as aggregated except in the case of Everlast, is shown below: Goodwill Brands 000 000 Sports Retail 3,072 - Premium Lifestyle 8,927 - Brands excl.
Everlast 48,926 6,418 Everlast 54,438 74,818 115,363 81,236 The Group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying value might be impaired.
The carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.
Impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for each CGU to which the intangible assets are allocated.
A CGU is deemed to be an individual fascia and these have been grouped together into similar classes for the purpose of formulating operating segments as reported in note 4.
The recoverable amount of CGUs was 410m.
Value in use calculations are based on five year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector served by the CGUs.
The key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each CGU, in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives as at 24 April 2016 were as follows: Sports Brands excl.
Everlast Retail Everlast Sales growth 0%-5% 0%-2% 0%-5% Terminal sales growth 2 % 0% 2% Gross margin 35%-50% 30%-40% 20%-30% Capital expenditure Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Nil - 1m Discount rates 11.3% 9.6% 12.0% The Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital is used in Sports Retail, Premium Lifestyle and Brands excl.
Everlast as these CGUs are considered to have similar risk profiles.
The key assumptions are based on managements historical experience and future plans for each CGU.
A reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of the brands and trading names and the Groups commitment to maintaining those brands.
All key assumptions are consistent with known external sources of information.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS The Group uses the equity method of accounting for associates and joint ventures.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of asset above, plus any cash balances.
Other debtors includes unremitted sales receipts and collateral in respect of derivative instruments.
Deposit funds are held on collateral to cover margin requirements for derivative transactions held with counterparties.
The collateral requirement changes with the market which is dependent on share price, interest rates and volatility and further purchases sales of underlying investments held.

CONTINGENT SHARE AWARDS The Executive Share Scheme Under the terms of the Executive Share Scheme, which was approved by Shareholders on 10 September 2010 and is a Revenue approved 92 scheme, the Board may make share awards in respect of the ordinary shares in the Company.
Awards may be made to Executives and Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities over a fixed number of shares subject to performance conditions.
Further details are set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 62.
An award of 8,073,036 shares was granted on 10 September 2010 at a share price of 125.5 pence, 4,000,000 of these shares have since vested and 1,000,000 have since lapsed.
These shares will only vest if all conditions are met.
No consideration is payable in respect of these awards.
Share Schemes The 2011 Share Scheme was a four year scheme based upon achieving underlying EBITDA before the costs of the scheme of 215m in FY12, 250m in FY13, 260m in FY14 and 300m in FY15 coupled with the individual participating employees satisfactory personal performance.
All of the above targets have now been met and 4m shares vested in September 2015.
On 7 September 2015 3,772,383 Shares sold by participants following exercise of awards under the Company's 2011 Share Scheme were acquired by Appleby Trust Jersey Limited as Trustee of the Sports Direct Employee Benefit Trust Trustee, with the acquisition being funded by a loan advanced by the Company.
The Shares were acquired at a price of 781 pence per Share in an off-market transaction.
The Trustee has purchased these Shares in order to help meet future obligations arising under the Company's Share Schemes.
Another 18m shares including the Executive Share Scheme are due to vest in the summer of 2017, subject to the individual participating employees continued satisfactory personal performance.
A share-based payment charge of 7.1m was recognised in respect of these share awards for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016, based on the Directors best estimate of the number of shares that will vest.
On 2 July 2014, a resolution was passed to implement the 2015 Share Scheme.
No grants have been made under this scheme to date.
The 2015 Share Scheme is a four year scheme based upon achieving an underlying EBITDA target before the costs of the scheme of 420m in FY16 and further targets in FY17, FY18 and FY19 coupled with the individual participating employee's satisfactory personal performance.
The 2015 Share Scheme requires that all targets are met before the shares vest.
Up to 25m shares are available to vest over two vestings in 2019 and 2021.
Since the first target in this scheme has not been met, the 2015 Share scheme has now lapsed.

The permanent contribution to capital relates to a cash payment of 50,000 to the Company on 8 February 2007 under a deed of capital contribution.
The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of the Companys redeemable preference shares of 10p each at par on 2 March 2007.
The reverse combination reserve exists as a result of the adoption of the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in accounting for the Group restructuring which occurred on 2 March 2007 and 29 March 2007 between the Company and Sports World International Limited, Brands Holdings Limited, International Brand Management Limited and CDS Holdings SA with Sports World International Limited as the acquirer.
93 The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.
The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement only when the hedged transaction impacts the income statement.
In FY16 an amount of 17.7m of deferred taxation on cash flow hedges was reclassified from Retained Earnings to the Hedging Reserve.
OTHER BALANCE SHEET RESERVES The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates.
The own shares and treasury shares reserve represent the cost of shares in Sports Direct International plc purchased in the market and held by Sports Direct International plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Groups share options scheme, see note 21.

During the year the Group utilised the accordion option under its working capital facility.
As a result, the working capital facility has been increased to 788m FY15 738m.
The facility is available until September 2018 and is not secured against any of the Groups fixed assets.
The Group also has a 250m working capital facility with Mike Ashley and MASH Holdings Limited the Group will not draw down from this facility in the foreseeable future.
This facility was agreed at market terms at its inception and is not secured against any fixed assets.
At the period end no balance was due and no draw-downs were made during the year.
The Group continues to operate comfortably within its banking facilities and covenants.
The carrying amounts and fair value of the borrowings are not materially different.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Groups defined benefit pension obligations mainly relate to Dunlop Slazenger Group Holdings Limited DSGHL, which was acquired on 28 January 2004.
DSGHL operates a number of plans worldwide, the largest of which is of the funded defined benefit type.
The Scheme has been closed to new members since 2005 and closed to benefits accrual since September 2015.
The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme in Sport Eybl Holding GmbH.
Dunlop Slazenger International Limited operates a defined benefit pension arrangement called the Dunlop Slazenger Pension Scheme Scheme.
The Scheme provides benefits based on salary and length of service on retirement or death.
These disclosures make no allowance for other pension schemes operated by the Company.
The Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least 94 once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective.
The Statutory Funding Objective does not currently impact on the recognition of the Scheme in these accounts.
The Scheme is managed by a Trustee Company, with the board of Directors appointed in part by the Group and part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Directors have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Scheme's assets.
The Directors delegate some of these functions to their professional advisers where appropriate.
The Scheme exposes the Company to a number of risks: Investment risk.
The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term the short term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficit emerges.
The Scheme's liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
Although the Scheme's assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
In the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.
The Scheme closed to the future accrual of benefits on 31 August 2015 and the four members who were active at the closure date were granted deferred benefits in the Scheme.
Since 1 April 2003, the Scheme has provided benefits on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis with Pensionable Earnings revalued each year in line with the increase in Retail Prices Index RPI inflation.
This method of revaluation is broadly consistent with the way that deferred pensions increase before retirement and therefore the closure to future accrual does not have a material impact on the value of members accrued benefits.
There were no other Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during which occurred during the period under review.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 24 April 2016, the only financial instruments held at fair value were Derivative financial assets and liabilities, which are classified as Level 2 except for Contracts for differences which are classified as Level 1, and Available-for-sale financial assets, which are classified as Level 1 except for House of Fraser UK & Ireland Ltd previously Highland Group Holdings, which is classified as Level 3.
House of Fraser Ltd is held at managements estimate of the fair value of the enterprise based on publicly available data.
A 1% increase in profitability for the Company would result in a 0.3m increase in value.
Inputs for this calculation include EBITDA and an EBITDA multiple.
Available for sale financial assets and contracts for difference are valued with reference to the publicly available share price.
The valuation of Derivative financial assets and liabilities is performed using an option valuation model, based on the market data available at the balance sheet date, depending on whether the instrument is a foreign exchange or an equity derivative.
The equity valuation model output is the result of a number of inputs including, the terms of the option, the share price, interest rates, the volatility of the underlying stock, and dividends paid by the underlying Company.
The Group has a put option referencing listed company shares.
To the extent that the market price of these shares is less than an agreed price on expiry of the put option, the Group has the right to settle the put option by acquiring ordinary shares.
If the market price of the shares is greater than an agreed price on expiry of the put option the counterparty will not exercise the option and the Group will receive the premium.
Sports Direct is required to transfer cash collateral to cover its obligations under the Put Option.
The amount of collateral required during the life of the Put Option can increase or decrease by reference to the underlying market price of the shares.
b DERIVATIVES: FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS The most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US Dollar, and online sales, principally in Euros.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash flows.
The Group does not hold or 99 issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives, including both forwards and written options, do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of the derivative financial instruments includes foreign currency purchase and sales contracts, written currency options and equity derivative contracts: 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 Foreign purchase and sales contracts - assets 62,165 81,729 Contracts for difference 12,785 - Equity derivatives - assets 7,577 10,470 Fair value of derivative financial instruments - assets 82,527 92,199 Foreign purchase and sales contracts and written options - liabilities 61,481 4,107 Contracts for difference - 1,062 Other 223 460 Fair value of derivative financial instruments liabilities 61,704 5,629 The sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 US Dollar purchases 77,663 418,561 Contracted rates 1.46-1.71 1.54 1.71 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 US Dollar sales 38,486 - Contracted rates 1.5367-1.5808 - 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 Euro sales 703,095 - Contracted rates 1.14-1.289 - NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 AUD sales 5,217 - Contracted rates 1.84 - The sterling principal amounts of written currency option contracts and contracted rates were as follows: 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 US Dollar purchases 41,669 421,053 Contracted rates 1.46 1.54 1.71 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 Euro sales 703,095 - Contracted rates 1.14-1.289 - 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 000 000 AUD sales 5,217 - Contracted rates 1.84 - At 24 April 2016 824m of forward contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the loss on fair valuation of these contracts of 6.6m has therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income.
The loss on fair value of the written options of 6.8m has been included within finance costs.
Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
At 24 April 2016 78m of purchase contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2015: 421m of purchase contracts and 677m of sales had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2015: nil sales contracts.
Written currency option contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
At 24 April 2016 42m of purchase contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2015: 419m of purchase contracts and 677m of sales had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2015: nil sales contracts.
100 c SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
The income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge.

It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
In respect of equity, the Board has decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
The Board is committed to keeping this policy under review and to looking to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when appropriate.
The objective of the Share Scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employees remuneration to the performance of the Company.
It is not designed as a means of managing capital.
In respect of cash and borrowings the Board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA, the working capital requirements and forecasted cash flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set.
The ratio for net debt to reported underlying EBITDA, excluding charges for the Share Schemes, is 0.26 2015: 0.16.
The objective is to keep this figure below 2.5.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the Group to meet its strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
These capital management policies have remained unchanged from the prior year.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 29.
ACQUISITIONS The principal acquisition for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 was the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Heatons group.
On 5 October 2015 agreements were entered into with the shareholders of Warnambool Ltd, the holding company of the Heatons group.
A minority shareholding was sold pro rata to all other share holders, meaning that the company owned more than 50% of the shares ii.
A Put and Call agreement was entered into between the Group and the remaining shareholders of Warrnambool Ltd to buy the remaining shares.
These were exercised at the start of 2016.
The transaction was submitted to the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and clearance was obtained on 13 November 2015.
This is the date at which control of Heatons was considered to have been achieved.
The combination of shareholding and put and call agreements was assessed to give 100% control as the Group obtained entitlement to 100% of the profit or losses and assets and liabilities from that date.
On derecognising the existing 50% investment in Heatons, the directors undertook a review of the fair value of the investment.
This review concluded that there was no material difference between fair value and book value, and that no profit or loss should be recognised.
The Irish market is a key area for the Group, offering strong growth in the clothing and footwear sectors.
The Group believes there are significant opportunities to improve the sports offering via Heatons 42 stores in the Republic of Ireland and 15 stores in Northern Ireland.

ULTIMATE CONTROLLING PARTY The Group is controlled by Mike Ashley through his 100% shareholding in MASH Beta Limited and MASH Holdings Limited, which own 303,507,460 50.71% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company and 26,492,540 4.43% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company ordinary shares respectively.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 25 April 2016, the Group purchased a property on Oxford Street for a total 108,000,000, a deposit 10,800,000 was included in Other Debtors at the year-end date.
Following the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, the Group notes the associated market volatility and in particular material changes to sterling dollar exchange rates, and the lack of transparency as to those rates in the short to medium term.
These factors are likely to impact purchases for which the Group is currently not hedged for the FY17 period and beyond.
The Group does not consider this an adjusting event for the accounting period ended 24 April 2016.
