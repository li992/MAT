Croda International Plc 108 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Impairment testing for goodwill The goodwill relates predominantly to the value of commercial and other synergies arising from the combination of acquired businesses, or the specific technologies or products acquired, with Crodas established global sales, marketing and R&D networks.
This goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to CGUs as follows: 2016 2015 m m Uniqema Personal Care and Life Sciences 193.4 193.4 Sipo 22.3 20.1 Incotec Life Sciences 69.0 59.3 Other 22.4 20.4 307.1 293.2 As discussed in the accounting policies note on page 93, goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant CGUs recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups current year results and a long term future growth rate.
Unless the risk profile of a particular acquisition dictates otherwise, the cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 7.3% pre-tax 2015: 7.3% for Uniqema and Incotec.
A long term future growth rate of 3% was used for this calculation.
For the purposes of the Sipo calculation, the pre-tax rate was increased to 9.0% 2015: 9.0% because of the higher risk associated with this investment.
An initial growth rate of 5% has been used for the first two years, which reflects the Directors growth expectations in that market.
A long term growth rate of 3% was then used beyond two years.
The key assumptions underpinning the forecasts employed in the value in use calculation reflect a prudent view of past experience and are that market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
In respect of the brought forward goodwill, the Directors believe there are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.
Goodwill arising in the year will be subject to the same assumptions and review process commencing the year after initial recognition.
