Under FRS 101, such revaluations are debited or credited to the income statement and included within retained earnings, therefore the impact of these current year and cumulative revaluations is transferred from the revaluation reserve to the income statement and retained earnings respectively.
2 Under FRS 101, certain intercompany balances and deferred tax assets have been reclassified on the balance sheet to reflect the expected settlement as due within less than one year or more than one year.
In addition, any cumulative retained earnings that have been derived from revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures and investment properties are considered to represent non-distributable reserves.
As a result, these have been transferred from retained earnings to a separate fair value reserve to better distinguish those reserves that are distributable.
