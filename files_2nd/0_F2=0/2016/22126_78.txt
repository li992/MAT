Underlying operating profit in 2016 includes the following items: As announced during the year, the Group encountered delays on the implementation of the new IT system on the Transport for London TfL congestion charge contract.
As a result of the delays, costs of circa 25.0m, including penalties for delays, were incurred in-year.
These are recorded within underlying operating profit because these costs and penalties were remedies within the contract.
As announced in our Contracts Assets Review statement on 21 February 2017, as part of its year-end close process, Capita has undertaken a comprehensive review across its major contracts, and has taken the decision to impair, at 31 December 2016, a number of historic assets relating to a few specic contracts, which were being amortised over their contract life.
Accrued income of 39.6m has been written down as a charge to underlying results.
These balances relate to the revenue and profit recognition judgements arising on long-term contracts.
Changes in judgement over the recoverability of such balances are recorded in underlying operating profit.
Property commercialisation transactions, executed in the ordinary course of business, have delivered profits of 28.0m 2015: 11.0m.
This profit is included within underlying operating profit because part of the Groups strategy is to create and deliver maximum value from assets that are either owned by its customers or are acquired by Capita as part of a wider transaction.
Customer contracts usually contain provisions to compensate the Group for exit costs and future profits in the event of early termination.
In-year customer contract terminations for customer convenience have led to associated exit fees paid to Capita of 21.7m 2015: 2.5m being recorded as income in-year.
These are included within underlying operating profit because these amounts are payable to the Group under the terms of the respective contracts being terminated.
