The transition from UK GAAP is not considered to have resulted in any material restatements.
Full details of the transition are shown in note 15.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost accounting convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate income statement and related notes.
The Company has also taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate statement of other comprehensive income.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101: Paragraphs 45 b and 46-52 of IFRS 2, Share-based payment IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures Paragraphs 10 d, 10 f and 134-136 of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements IAS 7, Statement of cash flows Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors Paragraph 17 of IAS 24, Related party disclosures The requirements in IAS 24, Related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group Intangible assets Intangible assets, consisting of software, are shown at their original historic cost net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the assets and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, typically between 2 to 5 years.
The need for any impairment write-down is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are shown at their original historic cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: IT and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years The need for any impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provision for impairment.
Where the Company has designated foreign currency borrowings as a fair value hedge against its foreign equity investments, the part of that investment which has been hedged is treated as a monetary asset and retranslated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency equity investments and on foreign currency borrowings including loans from other Group companies, to the extent the borrowings hedge the equity investments, are dealt with in the income statement.
Taxation Tax, current and deferred, is calculated using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profit at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement as the related pre-tax item.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax is measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the income statement.
For the principal rates of exchange used see the Group accounting policies on page 74.

Share based payment awards made by the Company to employees of its subsidiary companies are recognised in the Companys financial statements as an increase in its investments in subsidiary undertakings rather than as an expense in the income statement to the extent that the amount is not recharged to each subsidiary company.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense or as an increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings over the vesting period.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market based vesting conditions and no expense or investment is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest as a result of a failure to satisfy a non-market based vesting condition.
None of the Companys equity-settled transactions have any market based performance conditions.
Fair value for equity-settled share based payments is determinable from the Companys quoted share price at the time of the award.
At each balance sheet date, before vesting, the cumulative expense or investment is calculated based on managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest taking into consideration the likelihood of achieving non-market based vesting conditions.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value.
Fair value is estimated initially at the grant date and at each balance sheet date thereafter until the awards are settled.
Market based performance conditions are taken into account when determining fair value.
Fair value for cash-settled share based payments being only those that relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated by use of a simulation model.
During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated fair value of the award and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the balance sheet date.
Choice of settlement The Company can choose to settle awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in cash.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are accounted for as cashsettled transactions see above.
The Company can choose to settle awards under the Executive Participation Plan in either cash or equity, although it currently expects to settle all such awards in equity.
The awards under the Plan can also be structured as deferred shares or share options with a zero exercise price.
The Company intends the awards to operate in substance as deferred shares such that, subject to fulfilling the service condition, each participant receives actual shares on the applicable vesting date.
Awards under the Executive Participation Plan are accounted for as equity-settled transactions see above.
Dividends Dividends on ordinary shares are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, in the period in which they are paid.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and IFRS 7 Financial instruments:Disclosures which is the same as the accounting policy for the Group.
Therefore, for details of the Companys accounting policy for financial instruments refer to pages 77 and 78.
The Company holds derivative financial instruments that hedge financial risks of the Group as a whole and to which hedge accounting is applied in the consolidated financial statements.
However, these instruments and certain intra-group derivative financial instruments are accounted in the Company financial statements at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment in own shares Own shares held by the Groups Employee Benefit Trust and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust are treated as deductions from equity in the Companys financial statements.
Shares held in treasury by the Company have also been classified as deductions from equity.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially as the proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings.
The carrying value of borrowings takes account of accrued interest, issue costs and the effect of fair value hedges.
Retirement benefit obligations The Company has no employees and is therefore not liable for a share in any of the Group defined benefit schemes that are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
It does have unfunded liabilities in respect of former employees and these are reflected in the balance sheet.
