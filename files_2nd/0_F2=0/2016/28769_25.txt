Strategic report Governance Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 1 General information Rightmove plc the Company is a company registered in England Company no.
6426485 domiciled in the United Kingdom UK.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 comprise the Company and its interest in its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 are available upon request to the Company Secretary from the Companys registered office at Turnberry House, 30 Caldecotte Lake Drive, Caldecotte, Milton Keynes MK7 8LE or are available on the corporate website at plc.
Statement of compliance The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Board of directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 24 February 2017.
Basis of preparation On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Following a reassessment of the presentation of the settlement of dividends and share buybacks by Rightmove Group Limited on behalf of the Company, the 2015 Company Statement of Cash Flows has been restated.
The restatement decreased cash generated from operating activities by 113,155,000 and decreased cash used in financing activities by 113,155,000 for the year ended 31 December 2015.
It has had no impact on net assets as at 1 January 2015 or 31 December 2015, or the net cash flows and profit for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Refer to Note 28 for further details of inter-group settlement arrangements.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity and has the ability to affect the returns the Group will receive as a result of its involvement with the entity.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
During the year the Group acquired The Outside View Analytics Ltd Outside View.
The results of Outside View have been consolidated from the date of acquisition, being 31 May 2016.
Details of the acquisition are set out in Note 27.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are in accordance with Adopted IFRSs and are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31December 2015.
Amendments to IAS 1 were adopted for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2016.
This had no impact on the Group financial statements.
Going concern Throughout 2016, the Group was debt free and has continued to generate significant cash and has an overall positive net asset position.
The Group also had 4,026,000 of money market deposits 2015: 4,000,000.
The agreement with HSBC for a 10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility expired on 9 February 2017.
This has been replaced with a new 12 month agreement with Barclays Bank Plc for a 10,000,000 committed revolving loan facility that expires on 12February 2018.
No amount has been drawn under either facility in either year.
During the year 131,289,000 2015: 112,540,000 of cash was returned to shareholders via dividends and discretionary share buy backs.
Rightmove plc annual report 2016 85 Notes continued 1 General information continued The Board of directors is confident that with the existing cash resources and banking facilities in place, coupled with the strength of the underlying business model, the Group and the Company will remain cash positive and will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of 12 months from the date of signing these accounts.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 17 to 19.
In addition Note 4 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Capital structure The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 14 November 2007 under the Companies Act 1985 as a private company limited by shares with the name Rightmove Group Limited, registered no.
The Company was re-registered as a public limited company under the name Rightmove Group plc on 29 November 2007.
On 28 January 2008 the Company became the holding company of Rightmove Group Limited formerly Rightmove plc, Company no.
3997679 and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985.
The shares in the Company were admitted to trading on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 28 January 2008 and the Company immediately changed its name to Rightmove plc.
Details of the share capital of the Company are disclosed in Note 22.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated and Company financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and Company financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 2 j Revenue recognition, specifically regarding the period to which services relate and the recognition of revenue from membership offers including discounted or free periods.
Notes 16 and 24 The choice of valuation methodology and the inputs and assumptions used to calculate the initial fair value for new share-based incentives granted and the rate at which the related deferred tax asset is measured.
The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Companys shares at the grant date, expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and weighted average expected life of the instrument.
In respect of share-based incentives granted to employees, the number of share-based incentives that are expected to vest is based upon estimates of the number of employees that will forfeit their awards through leaving the Group and the likelihood of any non-market performance conditions being satisfied.
Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Non-GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles performance measures In the analysis of the Groups financial performance certain information disclosed in the financial statements may be prepared on a non-GAAP basis or has been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by Management.
The key nonGAAP measures presented by the Group are: Underlying operating profit which is defined as operating profit before share-based payments and National Insurance on share-based incentives: and Underlying basic EPS which is defined as profit for the year before share-based payments and National Insurance, with no related adjustment for tax, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements 1 General information continued The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures provide a more appropriate measure of the Groups business performance as share-based payments, which are a significant non-cash charge are driven by a valuation model, and NI on share-based incentives, is driven by reference to the Rightmove plc share price and so subject to volatility, rather than operational activity.
The directors therefore consider underlying operating profit to be the most appropriate indicator of the performance of the business and year-on-year trends.
For simplicity no adjustment for tax is made within the calculation of underlying basic EPS.
The nonGAAP measures are designed to increase comparability of the Groups financial performance year-on-year.
2 Significant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the parent Company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill Good will arising on a business combination represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and is included in intangible assets.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount previously recorded under UK GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business that occurred prior to 1January 2004 was not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2004.
Good will is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004. ii Research and development T he Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property platforms.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Expendit ure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible, the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Capitalised costs are held as an asset in progress until such point that the asset is brought into use, at which point it is transferred to the appropriate intangible asset category and amortisation is charged.
T he expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software and licences C omputer software and externally acquired software licences are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software or licence by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 20.0% 33.3% per annum Software licences 20.0% 33.3% per annum iv Market appraisal algorithm T he market appraisal algorithm identified on the acquisition of the Outside View Analytics Ltd is valued using the reproduction cost method based on market rate salaries.
Amortisation is expensed in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Market appraisal algorithm 33.3% per annum Rightmove plc annual report 2016 87 Notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 20.0% per annum Computer equipment 20.0% 33.3% per annum Leasehold improvements remaining life of the lease d Impairment The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in profit or loss.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the receivables original terms.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Money market deposits are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
They represent deposits with a maturity of over three months.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
g Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
h Employee benefits i Pensions T he Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme a defined contribution pension plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary exchange.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are incurred.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued ii Employee share schemes T he Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing executive directors and other employees to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to acquire equity settled share-based incentives.
Fair value at the gr ant date is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates based on government bonds.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
When either the employee or the Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition, the failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT T he EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited, and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
iv Own shares held by The Rightmove Share Incentive Plan Trust SIP T he SIP is treated as an agent of Rightmove plc, and as such SIP transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove plc and are therefore reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the SIPs purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
v National Insurance NI on share-based incentives Emplo yers NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based incentives are exercised.
In the case of share options, it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
In the case of nil cost performance shares and deferred shares, it is provided based on the share price at the reporting date.
i Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
j Revenue Revenue principally represents the amounts receivable from customers in respect of membership of the Rightmove platforms.
Agency, New Homes, Overseas and Commercial revenue comprises subscriptions for core listing fees and amounts paid for additional advertising products.
Contracts for these services are per branch or branch equivalent for Agency and per development for New Homes.
They vary in length from one month to five years, but are typically for periods of six to 12 months.
Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract or as advertising products are used.
Membership offers take place from time to time and may include discounted products and free periods.
These are recognised on a monthly basis over the contract term.
Agency, Overseas and Commercial services are typically billed in advance with revenue deferred until the service commencement date.
New Homes developers are billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the profit or loss on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the contract terms.
Data Services revenue relates to fees generated for data and valuation services under a variety of contractual arrangements.
Revenue is recognised when the service has been provided.
Third party advertising revenue represents amounts paid in respect of non-property advertising on the Rightmove platforms and is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
Consumer Services revenue principally relates to payment for leads and is recognised when the lead is generated.
Data Services, third party advertising and Consumer Services revenue is typically billed in arrears.
Rightmove plc annual report 2016 89 Notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued k Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Groups Chief Executive Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.
l Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
m Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances, money market deposits and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised on the date that the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise banking facility fees and bank charges and the unwinding of the discount on provisions.
n Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period net of any charge or credit posted directly to equity, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based incentives is to include the income tax effect of the tax deduction in profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.
The remainder of the income tax effect of the tax deduction is recognised in equity.
o Dividends Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
p Earnings per share The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees.
The calculation of underlying basic and diluted EPS is disclosed in Note 11.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements 3 IFRSs not yet applied A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in 2014 and was endorsed by the EU in 2016.
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 and to use the practical expedients for completed contracts.
At present revenue is recognised either over time where there is continuing service provided by Rightmove to the customer or at the point in time when the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer.
Under IFRS 15 revenue will be recognised when performance obligations are satisfied.
For the Group the transfer of control under IFRS 15 and satisfaction of performance obligations is over time.
We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 on the Group which has shown that the recognition of revenue will be consistent with the transfer of risks and rewards to the customer under IAS 18.
We have concluded following this assessment that the implementation of IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016, although it has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a corresponding lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items.
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Early adoption is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.
The Group has started a detailed assessment to quantify the impact on its reported assets and liabilities of adoption of IFRS 16.
So far, the most significant impact identified is that the Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for its operating leases in respect of office premises and company cars.
In addition, the nature of expenses related to those leases will change as the straight-line operating lease expense will be replaced with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The quantitative effect will depend on the transition method chosen, the extent to which the Group uses the practical expedients and recognition exemptions, and any additional leases that the Group enters into.
Once the detailed assessment has been completed in 2017 the Group will confirm its transition date, approach and related quantitative information.
Other amendments There are no other new or amended standards expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
4 Risk and capital management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk This note presents information about the Group and Companys exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
Rightmove plc annual report 2016 91 Notes continued 4 Risk and capital management continued The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or banking institution fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 90.0% 2015: 90.0% of the Groups Agency and New Homes customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identified loss exposures.
The Groups treasury policy is to monitor cash and deposit balances on a daily basis to ensure that no more than 30,000,000 is held with any single institution.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash.
The Group and Companys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups revenue model is largely subscription-based, which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
Throughout the year, the Group typically had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses, before financing activities, for a period of 95 days 2015: 137 days.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
i Currency risk All of the Groups sales and more than 97.0% 2015: 95.0% of the Groups purchases are Sterling denominated, accordingly it has no significant currency risk.
ii Interest rate risk T he Group and Company have no interest bearing financial liabilities.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash and money market deposit balances.
co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements 4 Risk and capital management continued Capital management The Board of directors policy is to maintain an efficient statement of financial position so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of directors considers that the future working capital and capital expenditure requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly return on capital measures are not key performance targets.
The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders as well as underlying basic EPS.
The Boards policy is to return surplus capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.
i Dividend policy T he Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy and monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to the growth in underlying basic EPS.
The Board has adopted this policy in order to align shareholder returns with the underlying growth achieved in the profitability in the Group.
T he capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the level of available retained earnings in the Company, after deduction of own shares held, and the cash resources of the Group.
The retained earnings of the Company, after deduction of own shares held, are 405,801,000 2015:400,808,000 as set out in the Company statement of changes in shareholders equity on page 84.
The Group has cash and money market deposits at 31 December 2016 of 17,775,000 2015: 12,418,000, the majority of which are held by the principal operating subsidiary Rightmove Group Limited.
The Group is well positioned to fund its future dividends given the strong cash generative nature of the business and in 2016 cash generated from operating activities was 169,250,000 2015: 143,181,000 representing an operating cash conversion in excess of 100%.
ii Share buybacks T he Company purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on available free cash flow and market conditions.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Groups processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour.
Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations.
The Groups objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Groups reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit.
This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas: requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions: requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions: compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements: documentation of controls and procedures: requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address the risks identified: requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action: development and regular testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans: regular testing of the security of the IT systems and platforms, regular backups of key data and ongoing threat monitoring to protect against the risk of cyber attack: training and professional development: and risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Rightmove plc annual report 2016 93 Notes continued 5 Operating segments The Group determines and presents operating segments based on internal information that is provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Groups reportable segments are as follows: The Agency segment which provides resale and lettings property advertising services on Rightmoves platforms: and The New Homes segment which provides property advertising services to new home developers and housing associations on Rightmoves platforms.
The Other segment which represents activities under the reportable segments threshold, comprises Overseas and Commercial property advertising services and non-property advertising services which include our third party advertising and Consumer Services as well as Data Services.
Management monitors the business segments at a revenue and trade receivables level separately for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated and of assessing performance.
All revenues in both years are derived from third parties and there are no inter-segment revenues.
Operating costs, financial income, financial expenses and income taxes in relation to the Agency, New Homes and the Other segment are managed on a centralised basis at a Rightmove Group Limited level and as there are no internal measures of individual segment profitability, relevant disclosures have been shown under the heading of Central in the table below.
The Company has no reportable segments.
2 Operating profit does not include share-based payments charge of 4,142,000 2015: 3,765,000 and NI on share-based incentives charge of 451,000 2015:3,331,000.
3 The only segment assets that are separately monitored by the Chief Operating Decision Maker relate to trade receivables net of any associated provision for impairment.

The carrying value of 2,465,000 goodwill, comprises 732,000 of purchased goodwill arising pre-transition to IFRS and 1,733,000 on acquisition of the Outside View.
Goodwill arising from the acquisition of the Outside View has been allocated to the Agency segment as the revenue expected from the Outside View product is attributable to Agency customers.
Given the low level of significance of the total goodwill balance and strong growth in the Agency segment revenue in the year, with no impairment indicators present, the disclosures as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets have not been made.

3997679 and its subsidiaries pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under s425 of the Companies Act 1985 by way of a share-for-share exchange.
Following the Scheme of Arrangement, the Company underwent a court-approved capital reduction.
The consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group immediately after the Scheme were substantially the same as the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Group immediately prior to the Scheme.
Following the capital reconstruction in 2008 all employees share-based incentives were transferred to the new holding company, Rightmove plc.
In addition certain directors contracts of employment were transferred from Rightmove Group Limited to Rightmove plc, whilst all other employees remained employed by Rightmove Group Limited.
Accordingly the share-based payments charge has been split between the Company and Rightmove Group Limited with 1,738,000 2015: 1,660,000 being recognised in the Company accounts as a capital contribution to its subsidiary.

A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
Further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% effective 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 has been calculated at the rate of 19% which represents the average expected rate at which the net deferred tax asset will reverse in the future.

co. uk Strategic report Governance Financial statements 24 Share-based payments continued Sharesave Plan The Group operates an HMRC Approved Sharesave Plan under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave Plan are as follows: Employee turnover before vesting Share price Exercise Expected Option Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value at grant date price volatility life rate yield condition per option Grant date pence pence % years % % % pence 1 October 2012 1577.00 1295.00 34.8 3.0 0.5 1.3 25.0 475.00 1 October 2013 2371.00 1896.00 27.3 3.0 0.7 1.1 25.0 659.00 1 October 2014 2144.00 1972.00 25.3 3.0 1.0 1.4 25.0 430.00 1 October 2015 3639.00 2960.00 24.7 3.0 0.8 1.0 25.0 933.00 1 October 2016 4293.00 3315.00 27.8 3.0 0.4 1.1 25.0 1233.00 Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and past employee behaviour.
The Sharesave options outstanding at 31 December 2016 have an exercise price in the range of 18.96 to 33.15 2015:12.95to 29.60 and a weighted average contractual life of 2.3 years 2015: 2.4 years.
Rightmove plc annual report 2016 109 Notes continued 24 Share-based payments continued Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP permits awards of nil cost options or contingent shares which will only vest in the event of prior satisfaction of a performance condition.
89,041 PSP awards were made on 1 March 2016 the grant date subject to EPS and TSR performance.
Performance will be measured over three financial years 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
The vesting in March 2019 vesting date of 25% of the 2016 PSP award will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three year performance period and the vesting of the 75% of the 2016 PSP award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target measured over a three year performance period.
PSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares.
The PSP awards have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black Scholes model for the EPS element and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the grant date and the vesting date.

2 Both the TSR and EPS performance conditions for PSPs with a grant date of 3 March 2014 have been met in full and 100% of the awards are expected to vest in March 2017.

The deferred share awards have been valued using the Black Scholes model and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value of the deferred share awards are calculated at the date on which the potential DSP bonus is communicated to directors and senior management the grant date as follows: Employee turnover before vesting Share price at Exercise Expected Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value Award grant date price term rate yield condition per share Grant date date pence pence years % % % pence 8 March 2013 3 March 2014 1781.00 nil 3.0 0.4 1.4 5.3 1708.00 3 March 2014 2 March 2015 2688.00 nil 3.0 1.0 1.0 5.6 2605.00 1 2 March 2015 1 March 2016 3044.00 nil 3.0 0.8 1.2 6.0 2941.00 2 1 March 2016 4069.00 nil 3.0 0.4 1.1 5.7 3942.00 1 Following the achievement of 100% of the 2015 internal performance targets, 36,276 nil cost deferred shares were awarded to executives and senior management on 1 March 2016 the Award Date with the right to the release of the shares deferred until March 2018.
