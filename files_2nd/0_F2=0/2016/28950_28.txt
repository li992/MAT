The Sage Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2016 159 Other notes 16 Acquisitions and disposals The following note outlines acquisitions and disposals during the year and the accompanying accounting policies.
Each acquisition or disposal during the year is discussed and the effects on the results of the Group are highlighted.
Accounting policy The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in the income statement.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups total identifiable net assets acquired.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Any subsequent adjustment to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
Acquisition-related items such as legal or professional fees are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant shares acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Where the Group enters into put and call arrangements over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until the ownership risks and rewards of those shares transfer to the Group.
