BAE Systems Annual Report 2016 | 122 Group accounts Preparation Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of BAE Systems plc have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed in the Directors report onpage 71, and in accordance with EU-endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the Companies Act 2006 applicable tocompanies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, with the resulting exchange differences recognised in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in the relevant notes.
These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The directors believe that the consolidated financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates, and provide a true and fair view of the Groups financial performance and position.
Critical accounting policies Certain of the Groups significant accounting policies are considered by the directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The critical accounting policies are listed below and explained in more detail in the relevant notes to the Group accounts: Critical accounting policy Description Notes Revenue and profit recognition 1 The recognition of revenue and profit The majority of long-term contracts are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction onlong-term contracts.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised when performance milestones have been completed.
Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired.
The ultimate profitability of long-term contracts is estimated based on estimates of revenue and costs, including allowances for technical and other risks, which are reliant on the knowledge and experience of the Groups project managers, engineers, and finance and commercial professionals.
Material changes in these estimates could affect the profitability of individual contracts.
Revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances.
Carrying value of intangible assets 8 The valuation of acquired intangible Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued in line with internationally assets:and used models, which require the use of estimates that may differ from actual outcomes.
These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Future results are impacted bythe amortisation periods adopted and, potentially, any differences between estimated and actual circumstances related to individual intangible assets.
the determination of assumptions Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost underpinning goodwill impairment less accumulated impairment losses.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill testing.
isallocated to Cash-Generating Units on a consistent basis.
The impairment review calculations require the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash-generating ability of the acquired businesses based on the Groups five-year Integrated Business Plan and the pre-tax discount rate usedin discounting these projected cash flows.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations 20 The determination of assumptions Pension scheme accounting valuations are prepared by independent actuaries.
underpinning the valuation of retirement Foreach of the actuarial assumptions used to measure the Groups pension scheme benefit obligations for defined benefit liabilities, there is a range of possible values and management estimates the point pensionschemes: and within that range that most appropriately reflects the Groups circumstances.
Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the size of the deficit.
the determination of the share of the The Group operates a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension schemes pensiondeficit allocated to the Groups and allocates a share of the surpluses and deficits in those schemes to the equity equity accounted investments.
accounted investments that participate in them.
On 1 April 2016, a separate Airbus section of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme MainScheme was created, reducing the total IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit, witha corresponding reduction in the allocation to equity accounted investments.
The deficit allocation methodology for the remaining employers of the Main Scheme and for all other schemes is based on the relative payroll contributions ofactive members, which is consistent with prior years.
Whilst this methodology is intended toreflect a reasonable estimate of the share ofthe deficit, it may not accurately reflect the obligations of the participating employers.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2016 | 123 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Preparation continued Other significant accounting policy judgements In addition to the critical accounting policies, management exercises judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies in respect of the following principal items: Tax provisions Management exercises judgement to determine the amount of tax provisions.
Provision is made for known issues based on managements interpretation of country-specific legislation and the likely outcome of negotiations or litigation.
The Groups approach is to consider each uncertain tax position separately.
Where management considers it is probable defined as more likely than not that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority, a provision is recognised.
The position is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Provisions are measured using managements best estimate of the most likely amount, being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.
The Group discloses any significant uncertainties in relation to tax matters to the relevant tax authority.
The resolution of tax positions taken by the Group can take a considerable period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to predict the outcome.
The directors believe that adequate provision is made for eachknown tax risk.
Included within the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 are current tax liabilities of 311m 2015 315m, which comprise a provision of 365m 2015 353m and other tax creditors of 51m 2015 35m, offset by a debtor of 105m 2015 73m in respect of research anddevelopment expenditure credits.
The provision of 365m 2015 353m is in respect of known tax issues, of which 325m 2015 287m relatesto non-UK jurisdictions.
Whilst there is inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of any resolution of tax positions, the Group does not consider that there is a significant risk of material change in 2017.
Deferred tax assets Included within the net deferred tax asset of 1,241m at 31 December 2016 is 1,212m in respect of the deficits in the Groups pension retirement schemes see note 14.
It is managements judgement that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits to recover the net deferred tax asset recognised.
This judgement requires the use of estimates of future taxable profits based on the Groups Integrated Business Plan.
Changes in accounting policies IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, issued in July 2014 with an effective date of 1 January 2018, was EU endorsed in November 2016.
It is not expected tohave amaterial impact on the Group.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014 with an effective date of 1 January 2018, was EU endorsed in October 2016.
The standard requires the identification of performance obligations in contracts with customers and allocation of the total contractual value to each of the performance obligations identified.
Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied either at a point in time or over time.
The standard will replace IAS 11, Construction Contracts, and IAS 18, Revenue.
An initial impact assessment has been undertaken which involved the review of all contract types across the Group.
The assessment indicates that revenue on the Groups long-term contracts currently being recognised based on the completion of separately identifiable phases milestones will cumulatively be recognised earlier under IFRS 15, which reflects the continual transfer of the benefits of the Groups performance to the customer.
It is expected that profit will continue to be recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated and retired and, accordingly, it is not expected that there will be a material impact on the timing of profit recognition.
There is no impact on the timing of cash receipts, which are determined bythe terms and conditions of contracts with the customers.
The assessment has not indicated any significant changes will be required to the Groups revenue recognition policy in respect of revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contract, services or licences.
IFRS 16, Leases, issued in January 2016 with an effective date of 1 January 2019, is not yet EU endorsed.
Currently, leases classified as operating leases are not recognised on the balance sheet.
The impact of this standard will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset on the Groups balance sheet in respect of the majority of leases currently classified as operating leases.
Consolidation The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint ventures results accounted for under the equity method.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
The Group controls a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from itsinvolvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the Consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of their profits andlosses, and the Consolidated balance sheet includes its share of their net assets within equity accounted investments.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of such entities are translated at average rates of exchange during the year.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS 1 January 2004 are presented in equity, but not as a separate component.
When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on sale.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2016 | 128 Notes to the Group accounts 1.
Segmental analysis Revenue and profit recognition Revenue represents income derived from the provision of goods and services by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Long-term contracts The majority of the Groups long-term contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts.
Revenue is recognised when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, which is when a separately identifiable phase milestone of a contract or development has been completed.
Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical andother risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
No profit is recognised until the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Goods sold and services rendered Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards ofownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Revenue from the provision of services not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract at the reporting date.
The stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses incurred as a percentage of total expenses to be incurred for material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage of total labour hours to be delivered for timecontracts.
Revenue from the sale of software licences is recognised on delivery to the customer when the Group has no remaining obligations to performand collection of the consideration is considered probable.
In circumstances where the Group has future obligations to perform aspart of a software licence and related services contract, revenue is recognised over the contract term.
Revenue and profits on intercompany trading are determined on an arms-length basis.
Research and development The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers.
Where the research and development activity is performed on behalf of customers, the revenue arising is recognised in the income statement inaccordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy on long-term contracts.
Reporting segments The Group has six reporting segments, which align with the Groups strategic direction, determined with reference to the products and services they provide, and the markets in which they operate: Electronic Systems comprises the US and UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems, electro-optical sensors, military and commercial digital engine and flight controls, next-generation military communications systems and data links, persistent surveillance capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems: Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, and covers the Groups cyber security, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities: Platforms & Services US has operations in the US, UK and Sweden.
It produces combat vehicles, weapons and munitions, and delivers services and sustainment activities, including ship repair and the management of government-owned munitions facilities: Platforms & Services UK comprises the Groups UK-based air, maritime, land and shared services activities: Platforms & Services International comprises the Groups businesses in Saudi Arabia, Australia and Oman, together with its 37.5% interest inthe pan-European MBDA joint venture: and HQ comprises the Groups head office activities, together with a 49% interest in Air Astana.
The Board the chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8, Operating Segments monitors the results of these reporting segments toassess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources.
Segmental performance is evaluated based on Key Performance Indicators sales see page 129 and underlying EBITA see page 130.
Finance costs and taxation expense are managed on a Group basis.

Key Performance Indicator Underlying EBITA Definition Profit for the year before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense EBITA excluding non-recurring items.
Non-recurring items are defined as items that are relevant to an understanding of the Groups performance with reference to their materiality and nature: Loss on business transactions: Non-recurring items in 2016 represents an impairment of 12m against the carrying value of the BAE Systems SanFrancisco Ship Repair business sold in January 2017.
A loss on the disposal of the Groups 75% holding in BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa Pty Limited of24m was included in non-recurring items in 2015.
Research and development expenditure credits relating to prior years: In 2013, UK legislation changed so that UK government credits for research and development spend are now accounted for as part of operating profit rather than as part of taxation expense.
Thistreatment was optional forthe first three years.
During 2015, the Group exercised that option, effective from 2013, and reflected thechange in the 2015 accounts.
Credits relating to 2013 and 2014, totalling 50m, were included in non-recurring items in 2015.
Purpose Provides a measure of operating profitability that is comparable over time.

Taxation expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted atthe reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences: on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws thathave been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

2016 comprises a number of separate items, individually less than 20m, in relation to which either resolution was reached in the year or new information enabled the Group to re-assess the related tax provisions.
2015 included credits totalling 134m in respect of the adjustment of certain UK and overseas tax provisions in the light ofclarification and rulings received.
In 2013, UK legislation changed so that UK government credits for research and development spend are now accounted for as part of operating profit rather than as part of taxation expense.
The adjustment reversed this treatment to show an underlying effective tax rate that was comparable with the prior year.
The 77m excluded from profit before taxation comprised 50m included in non-recurring items relating to 2013 and 2014 see note 1 and 27m included in underlying EBITA relating to 2015, of which 12m related to the Groups share of equity accounted investments.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Cost or valuation Goodwill Under the acquisition method for business combinations, goodwill is the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the netof the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of jointventures and associates is included inthe carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Programme and customer-related Intangible assets recognised by the Group include those relating to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, mainly inrespect ofcustomer relationships and order backlog.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include: Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred toacquire and bring to use the specific software: Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled bythe Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Group-funded expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an expense asincurred: Research and development expenditure funded by the Group on development activities applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related overheads: and Patents, trademarks and licences.
Amortisation Goodwill is not amortised.
Amortisation on intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a  basis over the life of the individual programme.
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Programme and customer-related up to 15 years Other intangible assets: Computer software licences acquired 2 to 5 years Software development costs 2 to 5 years Research and development expenditure up to 10 years Patents, trademarks and licences up to 20 years Other intangibles up to 10 years The Group has no indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments The carrying amounts of the Groups intangible assets excluding goodwill, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS36, Impairment of Assets.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets thatare notyet available for use, impairment testing is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash-Generating Unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash-Generating Unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Includes intangible assets with nil net book value no longer used by the Group.
Impairment testing The recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill is based on value in use estimated using risk-adjusted future cash flow projections from the five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions in the range 0% to 2% applied.
The IBP process includes the use of historical experience, available government spending data and the Groups order backlog.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.01% 2015 7.47% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the Cash-Generating Unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cashflows.

The majority of the projected cash flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation of growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services in commercial markets.
Impairment goodwill In 2015, the impairment charge of 75m in the Intelligence & Security CGU reflected lower business growth assumptions.

Property, plant and equipment Cost Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost ofdemonstration assets iswritten off as incurred.
The reimbursement of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment by a customer is presented as deferred income and recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the depreciation of the asset over its estimated useful life.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included inproperty, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Plant and machinery: Computing equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 5 years Other equipment 10 to 20 years, or the project life if shorter For certain items of plant and equipment in the Groups US businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts.
Typically, this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise onastraight-line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there isany indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

Investment property Cost Land and buildings that are leased to non-Group entities are classified as investment property.
The Group measures investment property atitscost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided, on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of investment property over its estimated useful life of up to 50years.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups investment property are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8. m Cost At 1 January 2015 186 Additions 13 Disposals 23 At 31 December 2015 176 Additions 9 Transfer from property, plant and equipment 9 Disposals 24 At 31 December 2016 170 Depreciation and impairment At 1 January 2015 57 Depreciation charge for the year 4 Impairment charge for the year 2 Disposals 7 At 31 December 2015 56 Depreciation charge for the year 2 Transfer from property, plant and equipment 9 Disposals 7 At 31 December 2016 60 Net book value At 31 December 2016 110 At 31 December 2015 120 At 1 January 2015 129 Fair value At 31 December 2016 167 At 31 December 2015 178 The fair values above are based on and reflect current market values as prepared by in-house professionals who have the appropriate professional qualifications and recent experience of valuing properties in the location and of the type being valued.

Equity accounted investments A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Carrying value The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises the Groups share of net assets and purchased goodwill, and is assessed for impairment as a single asset.
The carrying amounts of the Groups equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less provision for bad debts.
A provision for bad debt is established when there isobjective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default ordelinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Receivables with a short-term duration are not discounted.
A loss on provision for bad debt is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
Amounts due from customers for contract work includes long-term contract balances and amounts due from contract customers, less attributable progress payments.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when itbecomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of long-term contract balances for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and the remainder is included as amounts due tolong-term contract customers within trade and other payables.
Losses are determined onthebasis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are updated regularly.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to Group performance, as cash received on customers account.
Amounts due from contract customers represent unbilled income and are stated at cost, plus attributable profit.

Other financial assets and liabilities Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The international nature of the Groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Group uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Group uses foreign exchange derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to currency fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits with the Groups subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Fair value through profit or loss Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement for theperiod.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transaction income or expense, the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented inthe hedging reserve in equity.
Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from reserves into the cost of the underlying transaction and recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised in the income statement for the period.

Cash flow hedges The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various stages duringthe next 12 months.
The majority of those extending beyond 12 months are expected to have been transacted within five years of thebalance sheet date.
Amounts credited to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were 87m 2015 25m charge, including 74m 2015 54m onreclassification toprofit and loss and 13m 2015 79m charge on contracts held at 31 December 2016.

The gain arising in the income statement onthe fair value of the underlying hedged items was 1m 2015 loss 2m.
The ineffective portion recognised as a loss in the income statement arising from fair value hedges was 2m 2015 gain 1m.
Debt-related derivative financial instruments The debt-related derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of cross-currency and interest rate derivatives relating to the US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, and the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, respectively see note 18.
These derivatives have been entered into specifically tomanage theGroups exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risk.

Deferred tax A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The most significant recognised deferred tax assets relate to the deficits on the Groups pension retirement schemes see below.
This is because retirement benefit costs are deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by employees, but deducted in determining taxable profit either when contributions are paid to the pension retirement schemes or when retirement benefits are paid.
In reviewing the probability that taxable profits will be available in the future against which such contributions payments can be deducted, account has been taken of the deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes, which run until 2026.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

The Group has not recognised any deferred tax liability on temporary differences totalling 274m 2015 243m relating to potentially taxable unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments because any withholding tax due on the remittance of those earnings is expected to be insignificant.
Future changes in tax rates The UK current tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 and will reduce to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This will reduce future UK current tax charges accordingly.

Retirement benefits Pension schemes Defined contribution Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit The cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in whichthose benefits are earned by the employees.
Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs resulting from a plan amendment orcurtailment arerecognised immediately in the income statement.
The retirement benefit surpluses and obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet represent the fair value of scheme assets, less thepresent value of the defined benefit obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 158.
The bid valuesofschemeassets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
Thepresentvalues of scheme liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are, therefore, inherently uncertain.
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, limits the measurement of a defined benefit surplus to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit scheme and the asset ceiling.
The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, issued in 2007, provides an interpretation of the requirements of IAS 19, clarifying that a refund is available if the entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.
The Group has applied IFRIC 14 and has determined that there is no limit on the recognition of the surpluses in its defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2016.
Certain of the Groups equity accounted investments participate in the Groups defined benefit schemes and, as these are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated a share of theIAS19 pension surpluses and deficits to its equity accounted investments.
On 1 April 2016, a separate Airbus section of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme Main Scheme was created, reducing the total net IAS 19 deficit, with a corresponding reduction inthe allocation to equity accounted investments.
There was no settlement gain or loss upon sectionalisation ofthe Main Scheme.
The deficit allocation methodology for the remaining employers of the Main Scheme and for all other schemes is based on the relative payroll contributions of active members, which is consistent with prior years.
Whilst this methodology isintended to reflect a reasonable estimate of the share of the deficit, it may not accurately reflect the obligations of the participating employers.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.
However, following the creation of an Airbus section of the Main Scheme, the Groups obligation inrespect of Airbus has been removed in respect of the Main Scheme.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
Pension schemes Background BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal schemes in the UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Thetwo largest funded defined benefit schemes are the Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which, inaggregate, represent 69% 2015 71% of thetotal IAS 19 defined benefit obligation at 31December 2016.
The schemes in other countries are primarily defined contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2016, the weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit pension obligations were 19 years 2015 18years and 12years 2015 12 years, respectively.
The split of the defined benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main Scheme, 2000 Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below: Active Deferred Pensioner % % % 1 Main Scheme 32 19 49 2 2000 Plan 14 29 57 3 US schemes 32 17 51 1.

Retirement benefits continued Regulatory framework The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specific-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including thepayment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004.
These schemes were established under trust and the responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation PBGC up to certain limits.
These schemes were established under and are governed by the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage their operation.
Benefits The UK defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members final salaries.
The benefits attract inflation-related increases both in deferment and payment.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants, with benefits for new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme.
The Normal Retirement Age for active members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65.
Specific benefits applicable to members differ between schemes.
Further details on the benefits provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: baesystemspensions.
The US defined benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013.
The benefits accrued based on the final salaries ofmembers atthat point will become payable on retirement.
The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65.
Funding The majority of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
Theindividual pension schemes funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement frameworks set out in their funding policies.
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value, whilst the liabilities are determined based on prudent assumptions set by the trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries.
The separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes include assumptions which differ from the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting purposes shown on page 158.
The latest valuations of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan were performed as at 31March 2014 and showed a funding deficit of 2.6bn.
The total net funding deficit in respect of all of the UK schemes was 2.7bn.
Deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes run until 2026.
The next UKtriennial funding valuations, as at 31 March 2017, will commence inApril2017 and, in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes and other stakeholders, the Group will be looking at various options witha focus on thelonger-term view.
The results of future triennial valuations and associated funding requirements will be impacted by the future performance of investment markets, and interest and inflation rates.
The total Group contributions made to the defined benefit schemes in the year ended 31 December 2016 were 411m 2015 438m excluding those amounts allocated to equity accounted investments of 50m 2015 98m.
Equity accounted investments make regular contributions to the schemes in which they participate in line with the schedule of contributions and are allocated a share of deficit funding contributions.
In 2017, the Group expects to make contributions at a similar level to the recurring contributions and deficit funding as made in 2016.
The Group incurred a charge of 163m 2015 140m in relation to defined contribution schemes for employees.

Retirement benefits continued Risk management The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk.
Risk Mitigation Market investment risk Asset returns may not move in line with the The investment portfolios are highly diversified, investing in a wide range of assets, in order to liabilities and may be subject to volatility.
provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a materially adverse impact on the total portfolio.
To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching portfolio, which largely consists of index-linked bonds, gilts and swaps, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities.
Some 47% 2015 49% of the Groups pension scheme assets are held in equities and pooled investment vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term.
Some of the Groups pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of their investment strategy to manage the level of market risk.
In August 2013, the Main Scheme implemented a long-dated equity option strategy protecting 1.4bn of assets against a significant fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, some of the UK schemes rates, with lower interest rates leading to an invest in interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest rates.
The swaps increase in the valuation of liabilities.
are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
The Group is hedged against approximately 35% of interest rate risk.
Inflation risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in inflation, In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal with higher inflation leading to anincrease in UKschemes invest in long-term inflation swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in thevaluation of liabilities.
The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk.
The Group is hedged against approximately 40% of inflation risk.
Effective 1 May 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to allow retired members to elect for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain rights tofuture pension increases.
Longevity risk Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with Longevity adjustment factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in increases in life expectancies leading to an ordertoadjust the pension benefits payable so as to share the cost of people living longer increase in the valuation of liabilities.
In February 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan entered into an arrangement with Legal & General to insure against longevity risk for the current pensioner population, covering 2.7bn of pension scheme liabilities.
In December 2013, similar arrangements were entered into, with Legal & General, by the trustees of the Royal Ordnance Pension Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme, covering 0.9bn and 0.8bn of pension scheme liabilities, respectively.
These arrangements reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.

Retirement benefits continued Principal actuarial assumptions The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the obligation covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.

This inherently captures the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
Further information on the duration of the schemes is detailed on page 155.
Inflation In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
In the US, inflation assumptions are not significant asthe Groups US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation.
Rate of increase in salaries The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be Retail Prices Index RPI inflation of 3.2% 2015 RPI inflation of 3.2%, plus apromotional scale.
From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation of 2.2% 2015 CPI inflation of 2.3%, with the exception ofthe 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.2% 2015 RPI inflation of 3.2%.
For all UK schemes, the rate of increase in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes.
Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on either RPI or CPI inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap.
With the exception of two smaller schemes, the rate of increase in pensions in payment is based on RPI inflation.
Life expectancy For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of scheme members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2015 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1.25% 2015 1.25%, for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive mortality study.
For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2016 are a blend of the fully generational RP-2014 Aggregate table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2016.
IRS approval of the mortality tables is expected in 2017, following which the tables are expected to be adopted forfunding valuation purposes.

Retirement benefits continued Retirement benefits other than pensions Background The Group operates a number of non-pension retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefitsafter retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain USsubsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2016.
These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2016.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
Principal actuarial assumptions The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 4.8% 2015 4.8% based on the assumptions that the increases are 6.5% in2016 reducing to 4.5% by 2024 and 4.5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 5.5% in 2016 reducing to 4.5% by 2024 and 4.5% eachyear thereafter for post-retirement.

Retirement benefits continued Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2016 and keeping all other assumptions as set out on page 158.
Financial assumptions Changes in the following financial assumptions would have the following effect on the defined benefit pension obligation before allocation to equity accounted investments: Increase decrease inpension obligation bn Discount rate: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.6 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.6 Inflation: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 The sensitivity analysis does not allow for the impact of the Groups risk management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk see page 157 on the valuation of the scheme assets.
Across all of its pension schemes, the Group is hedged against approximately 35% and 40% ofinterest rate and inflation risk, respectively, measured relative to the funding liabilities.
The Groups US schemes are not indexed with inflation.
The table below shows the estimated impact of changes in the following financial assumptions allowing for the impact of the Groups risk management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk swaps, together with the impact on the matched asset portfolio.
It does notreflect any natural matching that occurs in the wider asset portfolio: Increase decrease Increase decrease inpension obligation inscheme assets bn bn Discount rate: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.6 0.2 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.6 0.2 Inflation: 0.1 percentage point increase 0.5 0.2 0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 0.2 The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions rate of increase in salaries, rate of increase in deferred pensions and rate of increase in pensions in payment used to value the liabilities.
However, upper and lower limits exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations of future inflation may not have the same impact on the inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities.
Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate.
To illustrate this, the increase decrease in the defined benefit pension obligation resulting from larger changes in the inflation assumption would be as follows: Increase decrease inpension obligation bn Inflation: 0.5 percentage point increase 1.8 0.5 percentage point decrease 1.6 1.0 percentage point increase 3.5 1.0 percentage point decrease 3.0 Demographic assumptions Changes in the life expectancy assumption, including the benefit of longevity swap arrangements see longevity risk on page 157, wouldhave the following effect on the total net IAS 19 deficit: Increase decrease innet deficit bn Life expectancy: One-year increase 1.1 One-year decrease 1.1 BAE Systems Annual Report 2016 | 164 Notes to the Group accounts continued 21.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Ifthe effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on anassessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Reorganisations A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as other known factors.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
Legal, contractual and environmental The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.
Management exercises judgement to determine the amount of these provisions.
Provision is made for known issues based on past experience of similar items and other known factors.
Each provision is considered separately and the amount provided reflects the best estimate of the most likely amount, being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.
There are no individual provision releases in excess of 10m.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranty and after-sales service costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery.
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum, but not the timing, of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels.
Reorganisations Reorganisation costs are generally incurred within one to three years.
There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions.
Legal, contractual and environmental Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided.
Other There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.

Fair value measurement Fair value of financial instruments Certain of the Groups financial instruments are held at fair value.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows andtranslating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair values of loans and overdrafts have been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in the current market environment.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices orindirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs.

Represents US deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities.
US$500m of the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, has been converted to a floating rate bond by utilising interest rate swaps.
These derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the bond, and gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
The bond has been included in financial instruments not measured at fair value because its carrying value has only been adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate risk on a portion of the bond.
All of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as level 2 using the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.
Financial assets and liabilities in the Groups Consolidated balance sheet are either held at fair value or their carrying value approximates to fair value, with the exception of loans, most of which are held at amortised cost.

Financial risk management Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% 2015 50% and a maximum of 90% 2015 90% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had 81% 2015 83% of fixed rate debt and 19% 2015 17% of floating ratedebt based on a gross debt of 4.3bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2015 4.0bn.
Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Less than Between one More than one year and two years two years m m m Cash and cash equivalents 2,769 Loans and overdrafts 811 811 The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2016, the Group had a total of $1.0bn 2015 $1.0bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 2.6 years 2015 3.6 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 11.6 years 2015 11.5 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 4.1% 2015 3.5% on US dollars.
Thecost of the fixed rate debt was 4.8% 2015 4.9%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost tothe Group by 8m 2015 7m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 14m 2015 7m.
Liquidity risk Contractual cash flows on financial liabilities The contracted cash flows on loans and overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments at the reporting date are shown below, classified by maturity.
The cash flows are shown on a gross basis, are not discounted and include estimated interest payments where applicable.

Financial risk management continued Borrowing facilities The Groups objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2015 2bn.
The RCF is contracted until2018 at 2bnand from 2018 to 2020 at 1.9bn.
The RCF was undrawn throughout the year.
The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper issuedby the Group.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had no Commercial Paper in issue 2015 nil.
Cash management Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements toensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in instant-access current accounts, short-term deposits and money market funds, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide adequate headroom as determined by cash forecasts.
The Groups objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
The Group adopts a conservative approach tothe investment of its surplus cash which is deposited with financial institutions with the strongest credit ratings for short periods.
The cash andcash equivalents balance at 31 December 2016 of 2,769m 2015 2,537m was invested with 33 2015 35 financial institutions.
A credit limitis allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process.
Currency risk The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchangerates, mainly the US dollar, euro, Saudi riyal and Australian dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
All material firmtransactional exposures are hedged and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
The estimated impact on foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs of a ten cent movement in the closing US dollar exchange rate onthe retranslation of US dollar-denominated bonds held by BAE Systems plc is approximately 59m 2015 58m.
Credit risk The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables, a provision for bad debts has been calculated taking into account individual assessments based on past credit history and prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk, and no one counterparty constitutes more than 11% of the balance 2015 12%.
The ageing of trade receivables is detailed below: 1 2016 2015 Gross Provision Net Gross Provision Net m m m m m m Not past due and not impaired 850 850 807 807 Up to 180 days overdue and not impaired 466 466 376 376 Past 180 days overdue and not impaired 76 76 59 59 Past 180 days overdue and impaired 85 40 45 76 34 42 1,477 40 1,437 1,318 34 1,284 1.
