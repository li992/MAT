124 Capita plc Strategic report Governance A Acco ccou un nt ts s NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 5 Other non-underlying continued Acquisition related costs and stamp duty: these costs incurred with acquisitions are not included in the assessment of business performance which is based on the underlying results.
IFRS requires certain costs incurred in connection with acquired businesses to be recorded within the Group income statement.
These charges are not included in the internal assessment of business performance which as above is based on the underlying operational results.
These charges are therefore separately disclosed as non-underlying.
6 Segmental information The Groups operations are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit offering a different package of related services across the Groups markets.
A description of the service provision for each segment can be found in the strategic report on pages 161.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable operating segments below.
The information disclosed below represents the way in which the results of the businesses were reported to the Group Board.
The reported segmental structure has been changed in the year and therefore the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Before eliminating sales between business units on consolidation, the Group accounts for sales between business units as if they were to a third party at market rates.
The tables below present revenue, trading result and certain asset and liability information for the Groups business segments for the years 2016 and 2015.
The 2015 consolidated income statement has not been restated for the impact of business exits and other non-underlying items.
If the 2015 underlying consolidated income statement was restated for both businesses exited during 2016 and businesses that were held for sale in 2015 but were not exited in 2016, revenue would be increased by 61.6m and profit before tax would reduce by 4.7m.
