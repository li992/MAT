OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Accounting policies Morgan Advanced Materials plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given in Shareholder information on page 174.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 51.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group, and include the Groups interest in associates.
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
These consolidated financial statements have been drawn up to 31 December 2016.
The Group maintains a 12-month calendar fiscal year ending on 31 December.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework: these are presented on pages 153 to 170.
Where possible the Group has set out individual accounting policies in the note to the consolidated financial statements most relevant to that accounting policy, including for property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and specific adjusting items.
Except for the changes set out in the Adoption of new and revised Standards section, the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
a Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.
b Functional and presentation currency The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
ii Acquisitions Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity is recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
iii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
iv Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS continued d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFRS are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
e Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro-rata basis.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is permanently impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss.
A significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial assets fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost and other assets not listed below is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss will be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
f Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
g Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared and approved.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS continued h Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, use and sale of products or processes.
The majority of the expenditure that the Group classifies as research and development relates to a gradual evolution of materials, products and processes over time through the activities of the Groups technology and application engineering teams, and can be characterised as incremental in nature, and is therefore not capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Accounting estimates and judgments Judgments made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The following accounting estimates are subject to significant uncertainty: Recognition of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill Note 11 contains information about intangible assets recognised on acquisition in prior years.
These primarily relate to technology and trademarks and customer relationships, which are supported by long-term relationships with key customers.
The determination of the fair value of these intangible assets on initial recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including expectations about future cash flows, discount rates and the lives of the intangible assets following purchase.
The Group has estimated that the customer relationships have an economic life of 15-20 years.
Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.
Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its cash-generating units which may differ from the actual results delivered.
In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Note 11 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis.
Specific adjusting items The Group separately presents specific adjusting items in the consolidated income statement which, in the Directors judgment, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size and incidence in order for users of the consolidated financial statements to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the underlying performance of the business.
These include the financial effect of items which occur infrequently, such as major individual restructuring projects.
Determining whether an item is part of specific adjusting items requires judgment as to whether it meets the Groups definition as detailed in the accounting policy.
Provisions Note 22 contains information about provisions.
Provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement of litigation are judgmental by their nature.
Amounts provided are the Groups best estimate of exposure based on currently available information.
Taxation The level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective judgments as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the Group operates.
Deferred tax assets are recognised based on managements assessment of the extent to which they are recoverable.
The Group periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based on the latest information available.
The Group records its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges.
Whilst management believes it has adequately provided for the probable outcome of these matters, future results may include adjustments to these estimated tax liabilities and the final outcome of tax examinations may result in a materially different outcome than that assumed in the tax liabilities.
Provisions are made against individual exposures taking into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strengths of technical arguments, past experience with tax authorities, recent case law or rulings on similar issues and external advice received.
Credit risk Note 20 contains information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, including a sensitivity analysis.
The Group establishes both specific and general allowances for impairment losses against receivables.
The general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS 108 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS continued Pension assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 21, including a sensitivity analysis.
The actuarial evaluation of pension assets and liabilities is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates.
Relatively small changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact on the net pension liability included in the balance sheet.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 51.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are described earlier in the Group Financial Review.
In addition, note 20 includes the Groups policies and processes for managing financial risk: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements underpinned by the Groups 200 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing October 2019.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and exchange rates, show the Group operating comfortably within its debt financial covenants for the next 12 months.
The current economic climate continues to have an impact on the Group, its customers and its suppliers.
The Board fully recognises the challenges that lie ahead but, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Non-GAAP measures Where non-GAAP measures have been referenced these have been identified by an asterisk where they appear in this Report.
Adoption of new and revised Standards The Group did not adopt any new and revised Standards during the year ended 31 December 2016.
New standards and interpretations A number of new Standards, amendments to Standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and have not been applied in preparing the Groups financial statements.
Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below.
The Group has not applied these Standards early.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and introduces a new revenue recognition model that requires the transaction price receivable from customers to be allocated between the Groups performance obligations under contracts on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
The Group is systematically reviewing its customer contracts and its data capture systems capability across the six global business units to assess the impact of the new Standard and ensure compliance.
Based on the Groups review, it is anticipated that there are no significant impacts to the Group as a result of the new Standard.
Thermal Ceramics customers receive a combination of goods and services, we anticipate that the timing of revenue recognition on these could change under IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and reduces the number of primary measurement categories for financial assets to two: amortised cost and fair value.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting.
The impact of IFRS 16 Leases is not currently known or reasonably estimable.

SPECIFIC ADJUSTING ITEMS Accounting policies The Group separately presents specific adjusting items in the consolidated income statement which, in the Directors judgment, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size and incidence in order for users of the consolidated financial statements to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the underlying performance of the business.
In 2016 and 2015 restructuring costs related to a major individual project, net pension settlement credit, business exit costs, impairment of plant, property and equipment, impairment of intangible assets and net loss on disposal of businesses are included as specific adjusting items as they meet these criteria.

The Group has also completed a one-time lump-sum cash out payment to certain former, deferred and vested employees of the Morgan US Employees Retirement Plan in settlement of the benefits promised by the Group.
As a result of these changes the Group has recognised a net pension settlement credit of 6.8 million, after deduction of transaction costs.
An income tax charge of 2.8 million was recognised in respect of the net pension settlement credit.
Impairment of intangible assets As a result of the continued reduction in demand in the defence market, a review of the carrying value of the remaining intangible assets of Composites and Defence Systems resulted in an impairment charge of 8.5 million, relating to a full impairment of the Composites and Defence Systems technology intangible asset.
This impairment was calculated by looking at the fair value of the assets less cost of disposal.
Refer to note 11 for more details of the impairment charge.
2015 Restructuring costs As reported in 2014, the strategic objective to drive the performance of the Electrical Carbon and Seals and Bearings businesses to mid-teen margins and beyond resulted in the Group undertaking a significant rationalisation of the carbon material footprint.
This started in 2014 with the downsizing of activities at the Swansea, UK site.
This footprint rationalisation continued in 2015 with the decision to cease and the announcement of the cessation of carbon material manufacturing at the Shanghai, China site.
These operations will be consolidated into other Group locations, mainly the USA.
This decision resulted in a charge of 1.5 million in 2015, 0.7 million of which related to the impairment loss on plant and equipment and the balance to site clean-up costs and other write-offs.
An income tax credit of 0.2 million was recognised in respect of these restructuring costs.
Business exit costs The business exit costs in the year relate to the deconsolidation of Morgan Thermal Ceramics Sukhoy Log Limited Liability Company Sukhoy and the subsequent remeasurement to fair value of the retained investment.
In April 2006 the Group acquired a 51% shareholding in Sukhoy, a fibre business based near Yekaterinburg, Russia.
The results and assets of Sukhoy were previously consolidated on the basis that the Group was satisfied that it exercised management control.
During 2015 there was a deterioration in the relationship between Morgan and the minority partner, exacerbated by the increasingly difficult market conditions in Russia.
As a result, it became clear to the Group towards the end of 2015 that it no longer had effective control of the business and that it was no longer appropriate to consolidate.
Based on the recent financial performance and the Groups view of the future prospects of the business it was concluded that the value of the Groups investment in Sukhoy was nil.
As a result the Group has recognised a 2.8 million charge in business exit costs in the 2015 accounts.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment The impairment of property, plant and equipment in 2015 was as a result of a review of the carrying value of assets that support the Groups North America vehicle and personal protection and high-temperature furnace-lining businesses.
Both of these businesses saw significant growth and investment in previous years but more recently they had been in decline.
The Group compared its expected future cash flows from these businesses with the book value of the property, plant and equipment dedicated to them and determined that a total impairment charge of 5.9 million was required.
An income tax credit of 2.1 million was recognised in respect of the impairment charge.
The 5.9 million of impairment loss forms part of the total plant and equipment impairment loss of 6.6 million, as shown in note 10.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS 116 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 6.
SPECIFIC ADJUSTING ITEMS continued Impairment of intangible assets As a result of the continued reduction in demand on Composites and Defence Systems from the UK Ministry of Defence, the review of the carrying value of the remaining intangible assets of Composites and Defence Systems resulted in a further impairment charge of 5.8 million, relating to a full impairment of the customer relationships.
Following this impairment charge, the carrying value of the Composites and Defence Systems intangibles was 9.8 million, all in respect of technology.
This was supported by the current expectations of the future trading performance of the Composites and Defence Systems business.
An income tax credit of 1.0 million was recognised in respect of the impairment charge.
Loss on disposal of business As reported in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts, on 30 January 2015 the Group completed the sale of a Thermal Ceramics business in Wissembourg, France.
This business manufactures low-temperature fibre boards used mainly in the building industry.
The Group incurred a loss on the disposal of this business of 6.1 million in 2015, in addition to the 1.9 million of business exit costs recognised in the 2014 accounts.
NET FINANCE INCOME AND EXPENSE Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement, net interest on IAS 19 pension assets and interest on IAS 19 obligations.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs interest and other costs are capitalised when they are incurred on raising specific funds to finance a major capital project which will be a significant productive asset, or to the extent that funds borrowed generally are used for the purposes of obtaining a qualifying asset.

TAXATION INCOME TAX EXPENSE Accounting policies Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of basic diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at 31 December 2016 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 52.3 million 2015: 33.9 million, 2014: 7.8 million, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 284.9 million 2015 and 2014: 285.1 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust, on which the dividends are waived.
Headline earnings per ordinary share is defined as operating profit adjusted to exclude specific adjusting items and amortisation of intangible assets, plus share of profit of associate less net financing costs, income tax expense and non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares during the period.
This measure of earnings is shown because the Directors consider that it gives a better indication of headline performance.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 285.1 million 2015: 285.5 million, 2014: 285.6 million.
Diluted earnings per share is 18.3 pence 2015: 11.9 pence, 2014: 2.7 pence.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Accounting policies i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or at deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the asset.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property are recognised in Restructuring costs and other items in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of plant and equipment are recognised in Operating costs before restructuring costs, other items and amortisation of intangible assets in the income statement.
ii Leased assets Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
iii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment and fixtures 3-20 years MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 119 10.

In March 2015, Morgan acquired the freehold of the Morgan Electrical Carbon site in Swansea, UK.
The terms of the agreement to acquire the site had been agreed and committed to at the time of signing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 and a provision was recorded, in Closure and restructuring provisions, to reflect the difference between the purchase price and the expected site value.
With the actual purchase of the site taking place in 2015, the cost of the freehold has been recorded as an addition to Land and buildings and an impairment loss recorded to bring the value down to the expected net realisable value, with the offsetting release from the provision.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group recognised impairment losses in relation to plant and equipment and fixtures totalling 3.5 million in the Seals and Bearings reportable operating segment and 2.4 million in the Electrical Carbon reportable operating segment, which has been recognised in the Impairment of property, plant and equipment line of the income statement, and further impairment losses totalling 0.7 million in the Electrical Carbon reportable operating segment, which has been recognised in restructuring costs line of the income statement.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Accounting policies i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
ii Research and development See note 1. iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses.
iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 3 years Computer software 3-10 years Customer relationships 15-20 years Technology and trademarks 15-20 years Order book Amortised over the period in which the associated orders are fulfilled MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 121 11.

The remaining amortisation period on this asset is seven years.
Impairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS 122 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 11.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued The table below shows restated comparative figures for the cash-generating units for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The restatements reflect the impact of the changes the Group made to its internal organisation during 2016, which cause the composition of its cash-generating units to change.
Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows: 2015 2016 Restated m m Thermal Ceramics 94.8 86.7 Molten Metal Systems 10.1 9.2 Electrical Carbon 32.9 30.1 Seals and Bearings 16.5 15.0 Technical Ceramics 39.9 36.2 Composites and Defence Systems 194.2 177.2 Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use, reflecting the projected discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating cash flow projections in year one.
The key assumptions that underpin these cash flow projections relate to sales and operating margins, which are based on past experience, taking into account the effect of known or likely changes in market or operating conditions.
A 2.2% growth rate has been used to calculate a terminal value.
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate.
These mediumto long-term growth rates have been reviewed by management during 2016 and are considered to be appropriate.
In 2016, the Group has used the following pre-tax discount rates for calculating the terminal value of each of the cash-generating units: Thermal Ceramics: 12.4%, Molten Metal Systems: 12.3%, Electrical Carbon: 12.5%, Seals and Bearings: 12.5%, Technical Ceramics 12.9% and Composites and Defence Systems: 10.9%.
These discount rates have been used as the Group believes they suitably approximate the rates used by end-market participants.
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise for each of the Thermal Ceramics, Molten Metal Systems, Electrical Carbon, Seals and Bearings and Technical Ceramics cash-generating units in any one of the following three circumstances: if the pre-tax discount rate was increased to 15%: or if no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value: or if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 24%.
During 2016 the Group recognised an impairment loss of 8.5 million on technology and trademark intangible assets in relation to the Composites and Defence Systems cash-generating unit, as a result of the continued reduction in demand in the defence market.
During 2015 the Group recognised an impairment loss of 5.8 million on customer relationships in relation to the Composites and Defence Systems cash-generating unit, as a result of the continued reduction in demand from the UK Ministry of Defence.
Further details of these impairments are given in note 6.

INVESTMENTS Accounting policies Investments in debt and equity securities Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.

INVENTORIES Accounting policies Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.

INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS This note provides information about the contractual terms of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings which are measured at amortised cost.
For more information about the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 20.
Accounting policies Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Finance lease payments Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity All of the Groups borrowing facilities are arranged by Group Treasury with Morgan Advanced Materials plc as the principal obligor.
In a few cases operating subsidiaries have external borrowings but these are supervised and controlled centrally.
Group Treasury seeks to obtain certainty of access to funding in the amounts, diversity of maturities and diversity of counterparties as required to support the Groups medium-term financing requirements and to minimise the impact of poor credit market conditions.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT This note presents information about the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity ie forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Financial risk management and Treasury Policy Group Treasury works within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee.
It acts as a service to Morgan Advanced Materials businesses, not as a profit centre, and manages and controls risk in the treasury environment through the establishment of such procedures.
Group Treasury seeks to align treasury goals, objectives and philosophy to those of the Group.
It is responsible for all of the Groups funding, liquidity, cash management, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other treasury business.
As part of the policies and procedures, there is strict control over the use of financial instruments to hedge foreign currencies and interest rates.
Speculative trading in derivatives and other financial instruments is not permitted.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial instruments such as liquid assets, derivative assets and trade receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2016 2015 m m Available-for-sale financial assets 0.5 0.5 Trade and other receivables 184.5 155.9 Cash and cash equivalents 122.4 49.8 Derivatives 2.1 2.0 309.5 208.2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 131 20.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industries and countries in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
Others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supplies.
The Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m m Not past due 153.1 1.2 122.4 0.6 Past due 0-30 days 21.1 0.3 20.9 0.3 Past due 31-60 days 4.7 0.2 5.1 0.1 Past due 61-90 days 2.7 0.1 5.0 2.4 Past due more than 90 days 18.4 13.7 15.9 10.0 200.0 15.5 169.3 13.4 The only movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables was an increase of 2.1 million 2015: increase of 1.2 million.
A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Cash, cash equivalents and derivatives Cash balances held by companies representing over 75% of the Groups revenue are managed centrally through a number of pooling arrangements.
Credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives in a diversified way from high-credit-quality financial institutions.
Counterparties are reviewed through the use of rating agencies, systemic risk considerations and through regular review of the financial press.
Liquidity and funding risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient borrowings and committed facilities to meet its medium-term financing requirements.
In October 2016 the Group completed a new US private placement amounting to $112 million and 60 million.
The new debt extends the Groups debt maturity profile and the proceeds will be used for repayment of the Notes falling due in 2017.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges The following table indicates the periods in which cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur.
This is matched with the periods in which cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to impact profit or loss.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out in accordance with the Treasury Policy, which has been approved by the Audit Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk The Group seeks to reduce the volatility in its interest charge caused by rate fluctuations.
This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps.
The proportions of fixed and floating rate debt are determined having regard to a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions, interest rate cycle, the Groups interest cover and leverage position and any perceived correlation between business performance and rates.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Fixed rate instruments Variable rate instruments carrying amount carrying amount 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Financial assets 164.1 49.8 Financial liabilities 413.6 226.9 0.8 40.3 413.6 226.9 163.3 9.5 The currency equivalent of 208.2 million of fixed rate financial instruments matures within one year in exchange for variable rate instruments.
The fixed rate financial liabilities predominantly comprise the currency equivalent of 362.7 million 2015: 184.6 million of Senior Notes as well as the currency equivalent of 47.0 million 2015: 40.5 million of euro payables under cross-currency swaps at a negative rate of 0.15%.
The average cost of the Groups fixed rate instruments is 4.1% 2015: 4.9%.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable element of the Groups net debt at the reporting date would have increased profit by 1.6 million 2015: 0.1 million.
A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased profit by 0.7 million 2015: increase 0.3 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Foreign currency risk Due to the international reach of the Group, currency transaction exposures exist.
The Group has a policy in place to hedge all material firm commitments and a large proportion of highly probable forecast foreign currency exposures in respect of sales and purchases over the following 12 months, and achieves this through the use of the forward foreign exchange markets.
A significant proportion of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group continues its practice of not hedging income statement translation exposure.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS 134 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 20.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued There are exchange control restrictions which affect the ability of a small number of the Groups subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group.
The Group does not believe such restrictions have had or will have any material adverse impact on the Group as a whole or the ability of the Group to meet its cash flow requirements.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-GBP borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.
2016 2015 GBP USD Euro GBP USD Euro Functional currency of Group operations m m m m m m Trade receivables 1.7 0.7 2.6 1.8 7.6 9.8 Cash and cash equivalents 0.8 47.8 3.4 1.0 3.3 2.9 Trade payables 1.9 6.9 6.1 1.3 8.7 2.1 Borrowings not designated as net investment hedges 39.3 0.9 Net balance sheet exposure 0.6 2.3 1.0 1.5 2.2 4.8 The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 31 December 2016 was a liability of 3.3 million 2015: asset of 0.6 million.
The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
Currency translation risks are controlled centrally.
To defend against the impact of a permanent reduction in the value of its overseas net assets through currency depreciation, the Group seeks to match the currency of financial liabilities with the currency in which the net assets are denominated.
This is achieved by raising funds in different currencies and through the use of hedging instruments such as swaps, and is implemented only to the extent that the Groups gearing covenant under the terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to remain comfortably within limits.
In this way, the currency of the Groups financial liabilities becomes more aligned to the currency of the trading cash flows that service them.
The Groups currency split of total borrowings after the impact of net investment hedges was as follows: 2016 2015 m m GBP 0.5 39.2 USD 294.0 186.7 Euro 70.2 57.3 Chinese renminbi 0.6 31.7 Japanese yen 15.2 Other 0.6 8.6 364.9 260.3 The Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2016 is as follows: Based upon the currency profile of the Groups net financial assets and liabilities, if GBP had strengthened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have decreased by 28.5 million 2015: 20.9 million.
Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have increased by 34.1 million 2015: 25.1 million.
Assuming the change occurred on the balance sheet date, there would be no impact on reported profit, as either the net financial liabilities are in the same currency as that of the respective Group entity, or the change would be offset by an equal and opposite change in the foreign currency monetary items in the Groups holding company.
MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 135 20.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments.
The impact of a weakening in GBP on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
Exchange rates The principal exchange rates used in the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries were as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate GBP to: USD 1.23 1.35 1.47 1.53 Euro 1.17 1.22 1.36 1.38 For illustrative purposes, the table below provides details of the impact on 2016 revenue, Group EBITA and profit before tax if the actual reported results, calculated using 2016 average exchange rates, were restated for GBP weakening by 10 cents against USD in isolation and 10 cents against the Euro in isolation: 2016 2016 2015 2015 2016 Group Profit 2015 Group Profit Revenue EBITA before tax Revenue EBITA before tax m m m m m m Increase in Revenue Group EBITA Profit before tax if: GBP weakens by 10c against USD in isolation 29.0 3.7 2.2 24.3 2.6 1.6 GBP weakens by 10c against the Euro in isolation 20.6 2.8 2.7 16.1 1.8 1.8 Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded defined benefit obligations.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators KPIs, to ensure the continued success of the Group.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys ordinary shares.
The Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings.

Equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings are 1.1-4.2% 2015: 1.6-3.5% and finance leases 4.1% 2015: 4.56%.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Accounting policies i Defined contribution plans For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to either publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans, and the Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is any retirement plan which is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of retirement benefit that an employee will receive, usually depending on one or more factors such as age, years of service and earnings.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
Remeasurement gains and losses, differences between the interest income and actual returns on assets, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Employee benefits pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit arrangements as well as defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plans are primarily in the UK, USA and Europe and predominantly provide pensions based on service and career-average pay.
In addition post-retirement medical plans are operated in the USA.
The Group has considered third-party powers and does not believe the Trustees have any powers that would prevent the Group obtaining a refund of any surplus on wind-up of the Scheme following gradual settlement of the plan obligations.
As such the Groups interpretation is that the current version of IFRIC 14 does not have an impact and, as a result, any IAS 19 surplus can be recognised as an asset and it is not necessary to recognise additional liabilities in respect of contribution agreements reached with the pension scheme Trustees.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued UK Schemes In the UK, the Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the UK Schemes.
The two UK Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees total service, and their career average earnings including allowance for consumer price inflation, although historically benefits were based upon an employees final salary.
Once in payment, pensions receive increases as set out in the rules, at either a fixed level, or in line with the Retail Price Index.
The overall duration of the UK Schemes is around 18 years.
The UK Schemes assets are held in trustee-administered funds which are governed by UK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees.
Responsibility for the governance of the UK Schemes including investment decisions and contribution schedules lies with the Board of Trustees which must consult with the Company on such matters.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company, plan participants and an independent trustee, in accordance with the UK Schemes governing documents.
Funding legislation in the UK requires that schemes are fully funded on a scheme-specific basis as measured, and this must be assessed at least every three years.
To the extent that there is a deficit against this measure, a payment schedule must be agreed such that the deficit is removed over a reasonable period of time.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the UK Schemes were undertaken as at March 2013 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 82 million.
On the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the UK Schemes, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit recovery payments totalling 7 million a year in 2016 17, increasing at 2.75% pa until 2023, and contributions in respect of future service as accrued.
New full valuations are due with effective dates of March 2016 and the outcome of those consultations, which are underway, will determine the Groups future contribution requirements, with any new deficit arising needing to be met through the payment of additional contributions.
The Group expects these valuations to have been completed by June 2017.
The UK Schemes were closed to new entrants on 1 August 2011, with any new employees receiving benefits through the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution arrangement.
The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to the future accrual of benefits on and with effect from 6 April 2016.
Employees active in the Scheme as at that date were enrolled in The Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan, with the option to opt out under relevant UK legislation.
US schemes In the USA, the Group operates a tax-qualified defined benefit pension scheme MUSE DB Scheme, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP which is not tax-approved.
In addition, a further tax-qualified scheme MAMAT was wound up during 2016.
The MUSE DB Scheme is frozen, and therefore employees accrue benefits within a 401k arrangement.
The US Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employees service and earnings.
The benefits are level both prior to, and whilst in, payment.
Overall, the US Schemes duration is around 11 years.
The qualified US Schemes assets are held in a trust separately from the Groups assets.
For the SERP the Group holds an asset to meet the obligations however, due to its nature this is accounted for as a Group asset, rather than an asset of the SERP.
Responsibility for the governance of the US Schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with a management committee, all of whose members are appointed by the Group.
The funding requirements in the USA, ERISA, require schemes to be fully funded at all times, and if not to target full funding within a period of seven years.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the US MUSE DB Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2016 and the deficit at that date totalled 11.0 million.
The Group made a 5.3 million contribution to the Scheme in 2016 and is expected to make contributions of 7.3 million in 2017 and 2018, these amounts being in excess of the minimum required contributions.
In addition to the above, the Group made a contribution of 2.3 million to fund the termination of the MAMAT Scheme and final payment of all earned benefits in June 2016.
This resulted in a settlement gain for accounting purposes of 4.3 million.
A further settlement gain of 3.2 million arose from the offer of a lump-sum cash payment to 1,226 former employees, deferred and vested members of the MUSE Scheme for which there was a circa 60% take-up.
The gains arose as a result of the differential between the value of the liabilities discharged from the plans on an accounting basis and the reduction in Scheme assets.
The lump sum was not under the original terms of the Scheme.
European schemes In Europe, the Group operates a number of retirement schemes, with the bulk of the obligations relating to arrangements for employees in Germany.
In line with local practice these arrangements are not funded in advance, with benefits being met by the Group as they fall due.

The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long-term and measured on external factors, based upon each plans duration.
In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the UK and USA is material to the cost of the promised benefits.
In both the UK and Europe, the assumed increases in salaries and pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued The rates shown below are single equivalents for the obligations as a whole derived from discounting along the yield curve.
In line with IAS 19, in determining the value of the annuity contract held in the UK we have reflected the same methodology as used to value the corresponding obligations, reflecting the actual cashflow profile and duration of the insured obligations, rather than those of the Schemes as a whole.
Actuarial assumptions were: 2016 2016 2016 2016 Rest of UK USA Europe the World % % % % Discount rate 2.62 4.16 1.60 2.90 Inflation UK: RPI CPI 3.20 2.10 n a 1.70 n a Salary increase n a n a 2.20 5.00 Pensions increase 3.00 3.10 3.70 n a 1.70 n a Mortality post-retirement: Life expectancy of a male aged 60 in accounting year 26.8 25.1 23.7 n a Life expectancy of a male aged 60 in accounting year 20 28.7 26.8 26.5 n a The actual liability in respect of global employee benefits will not be known until the last payments have been made.
In placing a current estimate on the Groups past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required.
For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy.
In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year-end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting Standard, IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits.
Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Groups cash payments to their arrangements.
The payments due are calculated based on local funding requirements, or in the case of the Groups unfunded arrangements on the incidence of benefit payments falling due.
The sensitivities of the Groups net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are: 2016 2015 Increase Increase effect on effect on deficit deficit Change in assumption m m Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 10.8 9.8 Inflation Increase by 0.1% 4.7 4.4 Mortality post-retirement Pensioners live 1 year longer 23.4 17.1 Exchange rates GBP weakens against USD by 10% 5.4 6.1 GBP weakens against EUR by 10% 4.2 3.1 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Groups Schemes.

The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisers.
Investment returns: The Groups net balance sheet and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by the schemes.
Longevity: T he cost to the Group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments.
To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements.
Inflation rate risk: In the UK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the UK Schemes pensioner population through the purchase of an insurance policy, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees.
Remaining investment risks have also been mitigated to some extent by diversification of the return-seeking assets and backing uninsured pensioner liabilities by bonds and swaps.
In addition, the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds: however the majority of the Groups arrangements invest in a number of other assets which will move in a different manner from these bonds.
Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the Groups income statement.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 8.7 million 2015: 7.8 million.
The Group expects to contribute 8.8 million to these arrangements in 2017.
Share-based payments The Group operates various share option programmes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
During 2016, awards were made to Executives under the Morgan Advanced Materials plc Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
No awards were made under The Morgan Advanced Materials Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan BDSMP, although awards remained outstanding from prior years.
The Company also maintains a UK all-employee Sharesave scheme Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004.
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are met.

PROVISIONS Accounting policies A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.
The best estimate of the expenditure required to settled the present obligation is the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
iii Environmental In accordance with the Groups Environmental Policy a provision is recognised for known environmental issues which the Group will rectify over the next few years.
In a number of jurisdictions companies have a constructive obligation to remedy any known environmental problems.
