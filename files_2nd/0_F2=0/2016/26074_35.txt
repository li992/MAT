This figure has been revised from the figure disclosed at June 2016 in line with the revisions to the acquisition balance sheet in the primary financial statements.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 159 Following the change in solvency regime to Solvency II from 1 January 2016, the Group has prepared its EEV with the covered business liabilities being valued consistently with IFRS instead of the previous Solvency I regime.
The impact of this methodology change has been reflected as at 31 December 2015 and has resulted in an increase in EEV of 6.5m.
Whilst the impact on total EEV has been small, there was a large increase in the shareholders net worth that was offset by a reduction in the value of in-force business to reflect the lower provisions for adverse deviations held in the IFRS reserves relative to the Solvency I Pillar 1 reserves.
The figures for the impact of the methodology change have been revised from the figures disclosed at June 2016 to reflect refinements to harmonise the implementation of the revised methodology across the Group.
Operating EEV earnings increased embedded value by 274.6m in the period, primarily from the value of new business written in the period of 212.5m.
Operating EEV earnings also include 42.5m in respect of the expected contribution from existing business.
The remaining 18.5m of operating EEV earnings arises from operating assumption changes which have partly been offset by experience variances, interest payable on the subordinated debt, and expenses in the non-covered business.
Non-operating EEV earnings increased embedded value by 109.6m, primarily due to positive economic variance from the fall in risk free rates over 2016.
Transaction and integration costs with regards to the merger of 64.1m pre-tax reduced the nonoperating EEV earnings.
