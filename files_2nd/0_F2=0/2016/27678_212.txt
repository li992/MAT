Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 166 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 B: Segment information B1: Basis of segmentation Segment presentation The Groups reported segments are Emerging Markets, Nedbank Old Mutual Wealth, Institutional Asset Management and plc Head Office, which includes the plc Parent Company and the other centre companies of the Group, which typically own and manage the Groups interests.
All these businesses, except Institutional Asset Management IAM, have been classified as continuing operations in the IFRS income statement for all reporting periods.
In determining the Groups adjusted operating profit AOP, all these businesses have been classified as core operations for all reporting periods.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, Institutional Asset Management has been classified as discontinued operation in the IFRS consolidated income statement.
Comparative profit and loss segment information has been restated accordingly.
This treatment is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, given the Groups stated strategic intentions.
The operating result of IAM includes Rogge Global Partners Limited up to the date of disposal on 31 May 2016 and the full year result of OM Asset Management plc OMAM.
Consistent with the Groups AOP policy as described in the Basis of preparation of adjusted operating profit on page 150, we will continued to recognise OMAMs operating result within the Groups AOP despite it being classified as a discontinued operation in the IFRS income statement and as held for sale in the statement of financial position.
For all reporting periods, Old Mutual Bermuda is classified as a continuing operation in the IFRS income statement, but as non-core in determining the Groups AOP.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, following the repayment of the majority of outstanding notes, interest payable in respect of Bermuda loan notes issued to Old Mutual plc are also included within non-core operations and excluded from AOP as it is no longer considered material.
For the year ended 31 December 2015, other items disclosed as discontinued operations relate to payments in respect of the disposal of US Life in 201 1.
Further detail is included in note K1.
The Groups segmental results are analysed and reported on a basis consistent with the way that management and the Board of Directors of Old Mutual plc assesses performance of the underlying businesses and allocates resources.
Information is presented to the Board on a consolidated basis in pounds sterling the presentation currency and in the functional currency of each business.
Adjusted operating profit is one of the key measures reported to the Groups management and Board of Directors for their consideration in the allocation of resources to, and the review of the performance of the segments.
As appropriate to the business line, the Board reviews additional measures to assess the performance of each of the segments.
These typically include sales, net client cash flows, funds under management, gross earned premiums, underwriting results, net interest income, non-interest revenue and credit losses.
Consistent with internal reporting, assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated between segments where appropriate and where there is a reasonable basis for doing so.
The Group accounts for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices.
The revenues generated in each reported segment can be seen in the analysis of profits and losses in note B3.
The segmental information in notes B3 and B4, reflects the adjusted and IFRS measures of profit or loss and the assets and liabilities for each operating segment as provided to management and the Board of Directors.
There are no differences between the measurement of the assets and liabilities reflected in the primary statements and that reported for the segments.
The Group is primarily engaged in the following business activities from which it generates revenue: life assurance premium income, asset management business fee and commission income, banking banking interest receivable and investment banking income and property & casualty premium income.
Other revenue includes gains and losses on investment securities.
