Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the Form of Proxy are set out in the note to the Form of Proxy.
If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy not the Chairman and give your instructions directly to the proxy.
In the event that a Form of Proxy is returned without an indication as to how the proxy shall vote on the resolutions, the proxy will exercise his or her discretion as to whether, and if so how, he or she votes.
You may also submit your proxy electronically using The Share Portal service at capitashareportal.
Shareholders can use this service to vote or appoint a proxy online.
The same voting deadline of 48 hours excluding non-working days before the time of the meeting applies as if you were using your Personalised Voting Form to vote or appoint a proxy by post to vote for you.
Shareholders will need to use the unique personal identification Investor Code printed on the posted Proxy card.
Shareholders should not show this information to anyone unless they wish to give proxy instructions on their behalf.
v To be valid, the Form of Proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which it is executed or a notarially certified copy of such power or authority must be deposited with the Company's Registrar, for this purpose being PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU, as soon as possible, but in any event not later than 12.30 pm on 21 April 2017.

If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
Nominated Persons should also remember that their main point of contact in terms of their investment in the Company remains the shareholder who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy information rights or, perhaps the custodian or broker who administers the investment on their behalf.
Nominated Persons should continue to contact that shareholder, custodian or broker and not the Company regarding any changes or queries relating to the Nominated Person's personal details and interests in the Company including any administrative matter.

The rights described in these notes can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
ix Any corporation which is a shareholder may authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at this meeting.
Any person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise on behalf of the corporation which he represents the same powers other than to appoint a proxy as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder provided, in the case of multiple corporate representatives of the same corporate shareholder, they are appointed in respect of different shares owned by the corporate shareholder or, if they are appointed in respect of the same shares, they vote the shares in the same way.
To be able to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting, corporate representatives will be required to produce prior to their entry to the Meeting evidence satisfactory to the Company of their appointment.
x To allow effective constitution of the Annual General Meeting, if it is apparent to the Chairman that no shareholders will be present in person or by proxy, other than by proxy in the Chairman's favour, then the Chairman may appoint a substitute to act as proxy in his stead for any shareholder, provided that such substitute proxy shall vote on the same basis as the Chairman.

If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is given discretion as to how the votes the subject of those proxies are cast and the voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies, when added to the interests in the Companys shares already held by the Chairman, result in the Chairman holding such number of voting rights that he has a notifiable obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make the necessary notifications to the Company and the Financial Conduct Authority.
