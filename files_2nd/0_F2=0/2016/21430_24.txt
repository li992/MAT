ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts 1 Segmental analysis The executive Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position at both a consolidated and divisional level.
Each division is an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8 in that the executive Board assess performance and allocates resources at this level.
All of the divisions have been aggregated in to one reporting segment on the basis that they share similar economic characteristics including: National supply agreements are in place for key inputs including materials.
Debt is raised centrally and the cost of capital is the same at each division.
Sales demand at each division is subject to the same macro economic factors, such as mortgage availability and government policy.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Chief Executive's Operating Review on pages 26 to 30.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations at a consolidated and divisional level when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation ofresources.

5 Exceptional item Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
On 7 March 2016, the Group disposed of its entire interest in Barking Riverside Limited, its joint venture company with the Greater London Authority, to L&Q New Homes Limited.
Bellway will receive total consideration with a fair value of 43.5 million over the next three years, including 17.0 million received in March on completion.
The deferred consideration is recognised as a 'fair value through profit or loss' note 18 financial asset.
In addition to the disposal proceeds, the Group will be relieved from its substantial funding obligations with regards to the ongoing remediation and infrastructure requirements of this long-term, capital intensive site.
The profit of 17.3 million, arising on disposal, has been treated as an exceptional item during the year ended 31 July 2016.
On 22 May 2015 the Group sold its remaining shared interest assets note 14 for cash consideration of 32.462 million.
This resulted in a profit on disposal of 6.865 million during the year ended 31 July 2015.
This was treated as an exceptional item.

The deferred tax assets liabilities held by the Group at the start of the comparative year that were expected to be realised after 31 March 2015 were valued at 20%, the substantively enacted tax rate that will be effective when they are expected to be realised.
The deferred tax assets liabilities held by the Group at the start of the current year have been revalued at the substantively enacted corporation tax rate that will be effective when they are expected to be realised.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from April 2017 and to 18% from April 2020 have been announced and were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate, from the aforementioned April 2020 rate of 18%, to 17% has been announced but was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The effective income tax expense is 19.1% of profit before taxation 2015 20.1% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 20.0% 2015 20.7%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to the non-taxable exceptional profit arising on the disposal of the Group's investment in Barking Riverside Limited note 5 to the accounts and enhanced tax deductions received by the Group in relation to land remediation relief.

The level of distributable reserves are sufficient in comparison to the proposed dividend.
8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.

Where Bellway owns 100% of the voting rights of a business, the company is considered to be controlled by Bellway and is treated as a subsidiary.
North Solihull Partnership LP, Cramlington Developments Limited and Leebell Developments Limited are classified as joint operations as the shareholders have substantially all of the economic benefit of the assets and fund the liabilities of the entities.
Ponton Road LLP, Fradley Residential LLP and Barking Riverside Limited until it was classified as held for sale were classified as joint ventures as the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangements rather than the individual assets and liabilities.

There are no deferred tax balances in respect of the Company.
In the ordinary course of business inventories have been written back by a net 9.4 million 2015 11.2 million in the year.
Land with a carrying value of 109.9 million 2015 83.2 million was used as security for land payables see note 17.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Group's operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.
14 Other financial assets 2016 2015 Group 000 000 At 1 August 32,186 Redemptions 32,317 Imputed interest 131 At 31 July Other financial assets carried at fair value are categorised as level 3 within the hierarchical classification of IFRS 7 Revised as defined within the standard.
On 22 May 2015 the Group sold its remaining interest in shared equity assets see note 5.
Other financial assets previously comprised loans, largely with non fixed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets were recorded at fair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Bellway p. l. c. 93 ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 14 Other financial assets continued The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of significant unobservable inputs including future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisited the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value was charged over the estimated deferred term to cost of sales, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
The imputed interest credited to cost of sales for the year ended 31 July 2015 was 0.131 million.
Credit risk, which the directors considered to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, was used in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reflects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors considered at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reflects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash flows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the initial market discount rate and the market discount rate at 22 May 2015, the date of disposal, and accordingly did not recognise any movements directly within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Company has no other financial assets.

18 Financial instruments Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' the creditor is initially recorded at fair value, being the price paid for the land discounted to present day, and subsequently at amortised cost.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expense, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.

25 Employee benefits a Retirement benefit obligations The Group sponsors the Bellway plc 1972 Pension Scheme the 'Scheme' which has a funded defined benefit arrangement which is closed to new members and to future service accrual.
The Group also sponsors the Bellway plc 2008 Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan 'GSIPP' which is a defined contribution contract-based arrangement.
Contributions of 4.514 million 2015 3.889 million were charged to the income statement for the GSIPP.
Defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.
Role of Trustees The Scheme is managed by the Trustees, who are appointed by either the Company or the members.
The role of the Trustees is to manage the Scheme in line with the Scheme trust deed and rules, to act prudently, responsibly and honestly, impartially and in the interests of all beneficiaries.
The main responsibilities of the Trustees are to agree with the employer the level of contributions to the Scheme and to make sure these are paid, to decide how the Schemes assets are invested so the Scheme is able to meet its liabilities, and to oversee that the payment of benefits, record keeping and administration of the Scheme complies with the Scheme trust deed and rules and legislation.
Funding UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 July 2014 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2016.
With regard to the Scheme, regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year were 1.21 million 2015 0.77 million.
The employer paid no special contributions 2015 3.20 million and reimbursed the pension fund 0.25 million 2015 nil million for expenses incurred by the fund.
The Group is expected to make regular contributions of nil million during the year ending 31 July 2017.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Bellway p. l. c. 99 ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 25 Employee benefits continued a Retirement benefit obligations continued Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: to protect the benefits of members of occupational pension schemes: to promote, and to improve understanding of the good administration of work-based pension schemes: to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund, and to maximise employer compliance with employer duties and the employment safeguards introduced by the Pensions Act 2008.
Risk The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant are: Risk Description Asset volatility The Scheme's defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
However, a significant proportion of the Scheme's assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities, that would be expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term but create volatility and risk in the short term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the Scheme's defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, with higher inflation increasing the liabilities.
However, there are caps of either a 3% p. a. or 5% p. a. increase in place to limit the effect of higher inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the Scheme's liabilities are to provide a pension for the life of the member, with any increase in life expectancy also increasing the Scheme's defined benefit obligation.

Actuarial assumptions The following are the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date: 2016 2015 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 2.40 3.60 Future salary increases 3.50 3.90 Allowance for pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p. a. if less 2.90 3.40 Allowance for deferred pension increases of CPI or 5% p. a. if less 2.00 2.40 Allowance for commutation of pension for cash at retirement 50% of maximum 50% of maximum The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 July 2016 are based on the S2PxA tables and allow for future improvement in mortality.
The tables used imply the following life expectancies at age 65: Male retiring at age 65 in 2016 23.3 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2016 25.3 years Male retiring at age 65 in 2036 25.5 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2036 27.7 years Sensitivities The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises the effect on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if different assumptions were used: Assumption Change in assumption Change in liabilities % Discount rate -0.25% p. a.
Increase by 4.3% Future salary increases 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 0.2% Inflation RPI 0.25% p. a.
Increase by 3.7% Mortality 1 year life expectancy Increase by 3.1% The calculations for the sensitivity analysis are not as accurate as a full valuation carried out using these assumptions.
Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Bellway p. l. c. 101 ACCOUNTS Notes to the Accounts continued 25 Employee benefits continued b Share-based payments The Group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP a share matching plan SMP, a deferred bonus plan DBP, employee share option schemes ESOS and Savings Related Share Option Schemes SRSOS, all of which are detailed below.
Awards under the LTIP and SMP have been made to executive directors, the Group Company Secretary, and senior employees, with awards under the DBP also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under these schemes.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the LTIP and the SMP is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 61to64 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
Various small share option awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level, under the terms of the DBP.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 normally for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share-based payments is as follows: LTIP, SMP and DBP 2016 2015 Number of Number of options options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 303,744 294,402 Granted during the year 90,969 117,458 Lapsed during the year 34,754 37,489 Exercised during the year 55,823 70,627 Outstanding at the end of the year 304,136 303,744 Exercisable at the end of the year The options outstanding at 31 July 2016 have a weighted average contractual life of 1.3 years 2015 1.5 years.

102 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2016 ACCOUNTS 25 Employee benefits continued b Share-based payments continued Valuation methodology For LTIP and SMP options granted after 24 October 2011 half of the performance criteria is based on TSR against comparator companies with the other half based on TSR measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
A simplified Monte Carlo simulation method has been used to determine the Group's TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial service companies.
In the case of the DBP, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
