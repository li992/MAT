STRATEGIC REPORT NICKEL, NIOBIUM AND PHOSPHATES Ruben Duncan Fernandes Wanblad NICKEL, NIOBIUM CEO CEO Anglo Base Metals American AND PHOSPHATES Brazil Our Nickel business is well placed to serve the global stainless steel industry, which depends on nickel and drives demand for it.
Our assets are in Brazil, with two ferronickel production sites: Barro Alto and Codemin, in the state of Gois.
The sale of our niobium and phosphates business, also located in Brazil, was completed in September 2016.

SCOPE TO FURTHER IMPROVE PRODUCTION A number of minor plant and mine improvements, including upgrading the plant and debottlenecking, have the scope to increase production by 10% at Barro Alto.
These improvements can be implemented for minimal capital expenditure, and could bring total annual nickel production to around 48,000 tonnes from 2020.
Following the successful rebuild of Barro Altos two furnaces, Nickels output in 2016 increased by almost 50% over the previous year to 44,500 tonnes, with the furnaces now producing at close to nameplate capacity.

attributable to overcapacity in steel production, and the effect of the weaker oil and gas sector.
Phosphates The average MAP CFR Brazil price was $354 tonne, 26% lower than for the equivalent period in 2015 $479 tonne, as a result of increased global supply and weaker than expected demand in the major markets the US, China and India.
In Brazil, demand for phosphate fertilisers from January to September 2016 was around 10.2 million tonnes, a 6.5% increase.
This strong demand was driven by favourable weather conditions, lower fertiliser prices, an attractive barter ratio, the weaker Brazilian real which supported farmers earnings and increased availability of funding to farmers.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 55 STRATEGIC REPORT NICKEL, NIOBIUM AND PHOSPHATES NICKEL, NIOBIUM AND PHOSPHATES continued OPERATING PERFORMANCE OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Nickel Nickel Nickel output increased by 47% to 44,500 tonnes Production guidance for 2017 is approximately 45,000 2015: 30,300 tonnes following the successful rebuild of tonnes previously 42,000-45,000 tonnes.
the Barro Alto furnaces, which are now producing at close to nameplate capacity.
Codemins production of metal was in line with the previous year at approximately 9,000 tonnes.
Niobium At the point of disposal, production was in line with the prior year at 4,700 tonnes Q3 2015: 4,700 tonnes: FY 2015: 6,300 tonnes.
This was despite two shutdowns: the first in the first quarter to reduce stock levels and facilitate site maintenance and work on residue disposal: and the second, a planned stoppage in May in order to implement the downstream metallurgy project.
Following the projects implementation, plant performance was strong, with an all-time production record achieved in July.
Phosphates At the time of disposal in the third quarter, fertiliser production was 0.9 million tonnes Q3 2015: 0.8 million tonnes: FY 2015: 1.1 million tonnes, with the increase being attributable to strong granulation plant performance at both sites and favourable operational conditions, which allowed two separate planned maintenance stoppages scheduled for January and March 2016 to be combined.
Phosphoric acid production was also boosted as a result of increased plant stability and higher equipment availability at both sites.
Dicalcium phosphate production was higher because of improved plant performance principally lower idle time at Cubato and a reduction in time spent on tank maintenance at Catalo, as well as higher phosphoric acid availability.
