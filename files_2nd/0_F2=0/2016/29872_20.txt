b Presentation of income statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented within the income statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as an investment trust, net capital profits may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. c Revenue Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the income section of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital section of the Income Statement.
Special dividends receivable are treated as repayment of capital or as income depending on the facts of each particular case.
Interest receivable on bank deposits is recognised on an accruals basis.
d Expenses Transaction costs arising on the purchase of investments are included in the capital section of the Income Statement.
All other operating expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged through the revenue section of the Income Statement except as follows: i exp enses relating to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the sale proceeds.
Details of transaction costs on purchases and sales of investments are disclosed in Note 5. ii exp enses are treated as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
e Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.

This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates applicable to the legal jurisdictions in which they arise.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust company, and its intention to continue to meet the eligibility conditions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and the ongoing requirements of The Investment Trust Approved Company Tax Regulations 2011, the Company has not provided deferred tax in respect of UK corporation tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
Where appropriate, the Company provides for deferred tax in respect of overseas taxes on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
f Investments held at fair value through profit or loss The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, all of the Companys non-current asset investments are designated as being at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition.
Subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: The fair value of financial instruments at the Balance Sheet date is, ordinarily, based on the latest quoted bid price at, or before, the US market close without deduction for any of the estimated future selling costs, if the instrument is held in active markets.
This represents a Level 1 classification under s48A of IAS 39.
In limited circumstances where the Company deems it appropriate e. g. where significant events have occurred at the Balance Sheet date between the latest quoted bid price in markets which close before the US, and the US market close, resulting in a valuation which is not deemed to be active, the close of market bid price for relevant securities may be adjusted using valuation techniques to achieve a fair value, thus representing a Level 2 type classification.
Note 12 provides further details on the classification of assets as at the Balance Sheet date.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the net profit or loss for the period as a capital item in the Income Statement.

Foreign currency gains and losses are included in the Income Statement and allocated as capital or income depending on the nature of the transaction giving rise to the gain or loss.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Capital Redemption Reserve represents the nominal value of shares repurchased.
Special Distributable Reserve reserve created upon the cancellation of the Share Premium Account and Capital Redemption Reserve.
