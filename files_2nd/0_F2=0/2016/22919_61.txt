Net borrowings Accounting policies Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs and are subsequently reported at amortised cost.
Certain bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship.
In these cases, the amortised cost is adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value recognised in the income statement.
The fair value adjustment is calculated using a discounted cash flow technique based on unadjusted market data.
Bank overdrafts form an integral part of the groups cash management and are included as a component of net cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less, including money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
Net borrowings are defined as gross borrowings short term borrowings and long term borrowings plus finance lease liabilities plus interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency interest rate swaps and funding foreign currency forwards and swaps used to manage borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
