Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2016 Non-GAAP information Unaudited information In the discussion of our reported financial position, operating results and cash flows, information is presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management.
However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Groups industry.
Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.
Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
Such non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure.
EBITDA EBITDA is operating profit excluding share in results of associates, depreciation and amortisation, gains losses on the disposal of fixed assets, impairment losses, restructuring costs, other operating income and expense and significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.
We use EBITDA, in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating profit, operating profit and net profit, to assess our operating performance.
We believe that EBITDA is an operating performance measure, not a liquidity measure, as it includes non-cash changes in working capital and is reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess internal performance in conjunction with EBITDA margin, which is an alternative sales margin figure.
We believe it is both useful and necessary to report EBITDA as a performance measure as it enhances the comparability of profit across segments.
Because EBITDA does not take into account certain items that affect operations and performance, EBITDA has inherent limitations as a performance measure.
To compensate for these limitations, we analyse EBITDA in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP operating performance measures.
EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a GAAP measure of operating performance.
A reconciliation of EBITDA to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided above and in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements.
Group adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share Group adjusted operating profit excludes non-operating income of associates, impairment losses, restructuring costs, amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, other operating income and expense and other significant one-off items.
Adjusted earnings per share also excludes certain foreign exchange rate differences, together with related tax effects.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons: a these measures are used for internal performance reporting: a these measures are used in setting director and management remuneration: and a they are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided above and in note 2 Segmental analysis to the consolidated financial statements.
A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings per share is provided in the Operating results on page 31.
Cash flow measures In presenting and discussing our reported results, free cash flow and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even though these measures are not recognised within IFRS.
We believe that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: a free cash flow allows us and external parties to evaluate our liquidity and the cash generated by our operations.
Free cash flow does not include payments for licences and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities.
Inaddition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which we have an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the consolidated statement of financial position or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: a free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable tosimilarly titled measures used by other companies: a these measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and a these measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.

Other Certain of the statements within the section titled Chief Executives strategic review on pages 10 to 13 contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information for which at this time there is no comparable GAAP measure and which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Certain of the statements within the section titled Looking ahead on page 15 contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Organic growth All amounts in this document marked with an represent organic growth which presents performance on a comparable basis, in terms of both merger and acquisition activity and foreign exchange movements.
While organic growth is neither intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure provides useful and necessary information to investors and other related parties for the following reasons: a it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its operating performance: a it is used for internal performance analysis: and a it facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies although the term organic is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
For the quarter ended 31 March 2015 and consequently the year ended 31 March 2015, the Groups organic service revenue growth rate was adjusted to exclude the beneficial impact of a settlement of a historical interconnect rate dispute in the UK and the beneficial impact of an upward revision to interconnect revenue in Egypt from a re-estimation by management of the appropriate historical mobile interconnection rate.
The adjustments in relation to Vodafone UK and Vodafone Egypt also impacted the disclosed organic growth rates for those countries.
In addition, the Groups organic service revenue growth rates for the year ended 31 March 2015, the six months ended 30 September 2015 and the quarters ended 31 March 2015, 30 June 2015, 30 September 2015 and 31 December 2015 have been amended to exclude the adverse impact of an adjustment to intercompany revenue.
For the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group has amended its reporting to reflect changes in the internal management of its Enterprise business.
The primary change has been that, on 1 April 2015, the Group redefined its segments to report international voice transit service revenue and costs within common functions rather than within the service revenue and cost amounts disclosed for each country and region.
The results presented for the year ended 31 March 2015 have been restated on a comparable basis together with all disclosed organic growth rates.
There is no impact on total Group results.
In addition, for the quarter and six months ended 30 September 2015 and year ended 31 March 2016, the Groups and Vodafone UKs organic service revenue growth rate has been adjusted to exclude the beneficial impact of a settlement of a historical interconnect rate dispute in the UK.
