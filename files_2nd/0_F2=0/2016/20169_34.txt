3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 103 Overview Strategic report Corporate Governance Audited financial statements Notes to the accounts Portfolio and other information 1 Segmental analysis Operating segments are the components of the Group whose results are regularly reviewed by the Groups chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, managed the Group on two bases throughout the year.
Firstly, as business divisions determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the Groups management hierarchy.
Secondly, he considers separate Proprietary Capital and Fund Management businesses focused on investment returns and Fund Management profits respectively.
A description of the activities, including products and services offered by these divisions and the allocation of resources, is given in the Strategic report.
For the geographical segmental split, revenue information is based on the locations of the assets held.
The segmental information that follows is presented on the Investment basis which is the basis used by the Chief Executive to monitor the performance of the Group.
The remaining Notes are prepared on the IFRS basis.

It is estimated that Ernst & Young LLP received less than 20% 2015: less than 20% of the total investment-related fees paid to the four largest accounting rms.
7 Income taxes Accounting policy: Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax.
Tax is charged or credited in the Statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
This may differ from the profit included in the Statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set off.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The main rate of UK corporation tax is to be reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017, and further to 18% from 1 April 2020.
Thesechanges will affect future UK corporate taxes payable and the rate at which deferred tax assets are expected to reverse.

Approved investment trust companies are used as investment fund vehicles.
The tax exemption for capital profits which they benefit from allows them to ensure that investors do not ultimately suffer double taxation of their investment returns, ie once at the level of the investment fund vehicle and then again in the hands of the investors.
Including 2 million of tax credits 2015: 2 million tax charge incurred in fair valued entities, the total tax charge for the Group was nil 2015: 4 million under the Investment basis.

It is uncertain that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect ofthese losses.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% 2015: 20%.

The policy is designed to give shareholders a direct share in the Groups realisation activities, while retaining sufficient funds within the Group to make new investments, meet liabilities as they fall due and meet internally set liquidity requirements.
When determining the level of realisations tobe paid as a dividend each year, the Board considers current and expected cash investment along with any significant actual or expected cash ows.
The distribution policy covers the Groups total annual dividend, which is split between a base dividend 8.1 pence per share and an additional dividend 2016: 13.9 pence per share.
The dividend can be paid out of either the capital reserve or the revenue reserve subject to the investment trust rules which state that at least 85% of revenue must be distributed by the Company.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 110 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 10 Investment portfolio Accounting policy: Investments are recognised and fide-recognised on the date when their purchase or sale is subject to a relevant contract and the associated risks and rewards have been transferred.
The Group manages its investments with a view to proting from the receipt ofinvestment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of investments.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and are subsequently measured at fair value, inaccordance with 3i Groups valuation policies.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value.
Fair value is measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair value is determined in line with 3is valuation policy, which is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines, details of which are available in Portfolio valuation an explanation on pages 148 and 149.
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan balance.
The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year.
If the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against any interest income accrued from the date of the assessment going forward.
Capitalisation at nil value is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has been fully provided for.
These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction made where loan notes have nil value.
In accordance with IFRS 10, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Groups unconsolidated subsidiaries is presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and liabilities.
A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 11.

The holding period of 3is investment portfolio is on average greater than one year.
For this reason the portfolio is classied as noncurrent.
It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions include 35 million 2015: 69 million in interest received by way of loan notes, of which 13 million 2015: 48 million has been valued to nil, as well as cash advanced to Debt Management warehouses.
Included within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is 26 million 2015: 38 million of interest income, which reects the net additions after write downs noted above, 5 million 2015: 14 million of cash income and the capitalisation of accrued income and non-capitalised accrued income is 1 million 2015: 3 million.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 111 Overview Strategic report Corporate Governance Audited financial statements Portfolio and other information 11 Investments in investment entity subsidiaries Accounting policy: Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
These entities are typically limited partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Groups interests in investments in portfolio companies Investment Entity Holding Companies.
The fair value can increase or reduce from either cash ows to from the investment entities or valuation movements in line with the Groups valuation policy.
Substantially all of these entities meet the denition of a Fund under the IPEV guidelines and the fair value and unit of account of these entities is their net asset values.
There were no adjustments to the subsidiaries net asset values in the year.
In 2015 an adjustment of 142 million was made to reect the carried interest payable attributable to the value of investments held by the entities but not accounted for within their net asset value.
This adjustment is no longer required as the underlying entities, being qualifying limited partnerships, have now adopted IFRS and account for the relevant carried interest payable within their net asset value.
Carried interest is described further in Note 13.
We determine that in the ordinary course of business, the net asset values of an investment entity subsidiary are considered to be the most appropriate to determine fair value.
At each reporting period, we consider whether any additional fair value adjustments need to be made to the net asset values of the investment entity subsidiaries.
These adjustments may be required to reect market participants considerations about fair value that may include, but are not limited to, liquidity and the portfolio effect of holding multiple investments within the investment entity subsidiary.
There was no particular circumstance to indicate that a fair value adjustment was required and after due consideration we concluded that the net asset values were the most appropriate reection of fair value at 31 March 2016.

There are no significant restrictions on the ability to transfer funds from these subsidiaries to the Group.
Support 3i Group plc continues to provide, where necessary, ongoing support to its investment entity subsidiaries for the purchase of portfolio investments.
During the year, there were net cash ows to the Group as noted in the table above.
The Groups current commitments to its subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 24.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 112 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 12 Fair values of assets and liabilities Accounting policy: Financial instruments, other than those held at amortised cost, are held at fair value and are designated irrevocably at inception.

The tables below show the classication of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy at 31 March 2016: Group Group Group Group Group Group Group Group 2016 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Quoted investments 297 297 399 399 Unquoted investments 1,243 1,243 1,272 1,272 Total 297 1,243 1,540 399 1,272 1,671 At the Company level, the disclosures remain the same, with the exception of unquoted investments.
Unquoted investments in the Company of 1,103 million 2015: 1,082 million are valued at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
This disclosure only refers to the directly held investment portfolio.
The fair value hierarchy also applies to Investments in investment entities, see Note 11 for details.
Investments in investment entities are fair valued at the entitys net asset value, with the most significant component being the underlying investment portfolio.
The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments, with anyother assets or liabilities within investment entities valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Note 11 details theDirectors considerations about the fair value of the underlying Investment entity subsidiaries.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 114 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 12 Fair values of assets and liabilities continued Movements in the directly held investment portfolio categorised as Level 3 during the year: Company Group Group Company 2015 2016 2015 2016 restated m m m m Opening book value 1,272 1,324 1,082 1,166 Additions 164 201 95 107 of which loan notes with nil value 13 48 13 48 Disposals, repayments and write-offs 166 136 165 136 1 Fair value movement 72 117 98 117 Transfer of investment Level 3 to Level 1 112 70 Other movements 86 74 6 54 Closing book value 1,243 1,272 1,103 1,082 1 All fair value movements relate to assets held at the end of the period.
Unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Statement of comprehensive income: realised profits over value on disposal of investment of 10 million 2015: 19 million, dividend income of 46 million 2015: 23 million and foreign exchange gains of 40 million 2015: 52 million losses.
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2016, classied as Level 3, 28% 2015: 44% were valued using a multiple of earnings and the remaining 72% 2015: 56% were valued using alternative valuation methodologies.
Valuation multiple The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation.
The multiple is derived from comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples.
Companies in the same industry and geography and, where possible, with a similar business model and prole are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth potential and relative performance.
The value weighted average earnings multiple used when valuing the portfolio was 9.83x 2015: 9.68x.
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2016 decreased by 5%, theinvestment portfolio would decrease by 19 million 2015: 35 million or 1% 2015: 2%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a negative impact of 173 million 2015: 121 million or 6% 2015: 5%.
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by 19 million 2015: 33 million or 1% 2015: 2%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of 172 million 2015: 122 million or 6% 2015: 6%.
Alternative valuation methodologies There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, forreasons specic to individual assets.
The details of such valuation methodologies, and the inputs that are used, are given in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets, by value and at year end the following techniques were used: 30% DCF 2015: 21%, 11% Imminent sale 2015: 7%, 10% Industry metric 2015: 10%, 18% broker quotes 2015: 13% and 3% other 2015: 5%.
If the value of all of the investments valued under alternative methodologies moved by 5%, this would have an impact on the investment portfolio of 45 million 2015: 35 million or 3% 2015: 2%.
If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have an impact of 9 million 2015: 6 million or 0.3% 2015: 0.3%.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 115 Overview Strategic report Corporate Governance Audited financial statements Portfolio and other information 13 Carried interest and performance fees Accounting policy: Carried interest and performance fees receivable The Group earns a share of profits carried interest and performance fees receivable from funds which it manages on behalf ofthird parties.
These profits are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management funds and is measured at fair value.
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable is made once the performance conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value.
Fair value is determined using the Groups valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date.
An accrual is made equal to the Groups share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iNs most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and a high water mark.
Carried interest and performance fees payable The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments.
Carried interest and performance fees payable is the term used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions and is measured at fair value.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest plans.
Carried interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in that plans were realised at fair value.
An accrual is made equal to the executives share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place in the carried interest plan, discounted to reect the likely actual cash payment date, which may be materially later than the time of the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued when the Group becomes contractually liable to make payments to the team.
Under IFRS 10, where carried interest payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2016, an additional 299 million of carried interest payable was recognised in the Statement of financial position of these investment entity subsidiaries 2015: 142 million.
As detailed in Note 11, the net assets of the Investment Entity subsidiaries were adjusted to reect 142 million of carry payable in FY2015.
No such adjustment was required in FY2016.

The duration of the Plans dened benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 20 years.
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2016 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables allowing for improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% unchanged from 31 March 2015.
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2036 2015: 2035 is projected to be 33.6 2015: 33.4 years compared to 31.3 2015: 31.1 years for someone reaching 60 in 2016.
The sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on retirement benefit surplus Change in assumption 2016 2015 Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 10 million Decrease by 12 million Retail Price Index RPI ination Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 7 million Decrease by 11 million Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Decrease by 15 million Decrease by 16 million The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its dened benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plans assets may reduce the value of the dened benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements.
To reduce the volatility of the Plans assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plans equity holdings by switching them to bonds over time.
The Plans assets are also diversied across different asset classes.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plans IAS 19 dened benefit obligation.
However, the Plan holds a proportion of its assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the dened benefit obligation would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plans assets.
Ination risk The Plans dened benefit obligations are linked to ination, and higher ination will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the Plans assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with ination, meaning that an increase in ination could reduce or eliminate the dened benefit surplus.
Life expectancy The Plans obligations are to provide benets for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plans dened benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benets by members with effect from 5 April 2011, the Group ceased to make regular contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The Group does not intend to make contributions in the next year.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 was completed in March 2014.
The results of that valuation showed that the Plan had an actuarial surplus of 1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group was not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of that valuation.
The contingent asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 25, remains in place.
It is expected that the next triennial actuarial funding valuation exercise will be based on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 June 2016.
During the year, the Group launched a programme to offer the Plans members exibility in how they take their pension benets following the Governments Freedom and choice in pensions changes announced in April 2014.
This included the provision of independent financial advice and a range of options for deferred and pensioner members.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 126 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 27 Share-based payments Accounting policy: The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees.
Equity-settled schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the period that employees provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting date of the shares.
The number of share options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services conditions included in the terms of the award will be met.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option if any, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant factors.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the priceof the shares of 3i Group plc.
The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the year.
The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised inthe Statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
They are fair valued at each reporting date.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payment transactions isadjusted for the forfeitures of the participants rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments.
The cost of the share-based payments is allocated either to operating expenses bonuses or carried interest depending on the original driver ofthe award.
Executive Director Long-Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is shown below: 2016 2015 m m 1,2 Share awards included as operating expenses 10 15 1 Share awards included as carried interest 5 4 3 Cash-settled share awards 4 3 19 22 1 Credited to equity.

3 Recognised in operating expenses and or carried interest.
The features of the Groups share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Report of the Board on Directors remuneration on pages 87 and 88.
To ensure that employees interests are aligned with shareholders, a significant amount of variable compensation paid to higher earning employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years.
For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may be granted phantom awards under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of ashare award without entitling the participant to acquire shares.
The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2016 is 4 million 2015: 5 million.
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2016 was 457 pence 2015: 323 pence.
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised: Expected Share price Exercise Expected option life Risk free Valuation methodology at issue price volatility in years Dividend yield interest rate Binomial and Monte Carlo models 564p 32% 34 1.01% Black Scholes 542p 24% 3 3.6% 1.00% Expected volatility was determined by reviewing share price volatility for the expected life of each option up to the date of grant.

28 Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section on pages 27 to 35.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specic financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share the same financial risks.
Financial risks Concentration risk 3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well as through the maturity prole of its investment portfolio.
Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have a maximum exposure limit.
This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 63 in the Corporate Governance section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in the Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 25 large investments table on pages 146 and 147. Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, derivatives, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with 86% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated money market funds and 4% held in deposit accounts with an initial notice period of greater than 90 days.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with banks with a credit rating of Aor higher.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is reected through fair value movements.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Further detail can be found in the Price risk market uctuations disclosure in this Note and the sensitivity disclosure to changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of Note 12.
Liquidity risk The liquidity outlook is monitored weekly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews of the balance sheet.
The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage control policy.
These are noted in the risk mitigation section on page 33 of the Risk section.
The table on the next page analyses the maturity ofthe Groups gross contractual liabilities.

The Company disclosures are the same as those for the Group with the following exceptions: carried interest and performance fees payable within one year is nil 2015: nil and trade and other payables within one year is 417 million restated 2015: 319 million.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market uctuations.
The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate risk has primarily been managed through a reduction in gross debt since 2012.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small as the Groups outstanding debt is xed rate.
The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest receivable on cash and deposit.
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate increase in total comprehensive income of 10 million 2015: 9 million increase for the Group and 9 million income 2015: 8 million for the Company.
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and valuation of portfolio companies and valuation of debt management investments caused by interest rate uctuations.
ii Currency risk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee and all other currencies combined are shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange risk is not materially different from the Group.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 129 Overview Strategic report Corporate Governance Audited financial statements Portfolio and other information 28 Financial risk management continued The Group considers currency risk on specic investment and realisation transactions and has reduced hedging on a consolidated basis over time.
Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided on page 32.

The Investment Committees role in risk management is discussed further in the Risk section.
A 15% change in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on the Statement of comprehensive income: Quoted Unquoted investment investment Total Group m m m At 31 March 2016 45 186 231 At 31 March 2015 60 191 251 Quoted Unquoted investment investment Total Company m m m At 31 March 2016 45 165 210 At 31 March 2015 restated 50 162 212 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 130 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 29 Related parties and interests in other entities The Group has various related parties stemming from relationships with limited partnerships managed by the Group, its investment portfolio including unconsolidated subsidiaries, its advisory arrangements and its key management personnel.
In addition, the Company has related parties in respect of its subsidiaries.
Some of these subsidiaries are held at fair value unconsolidated subsidiaries due to the treatment prescribed in IFRS 10.
Related parties Limited partnerships The Group manages a number of external funds which invest through limited partnerships.
Group companies act as the general partners of these limited partnerships and exert significant inuence over them.
The following amounts have been included in respect of these limited partnerships: Group Group Company Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 Statement of comprehensive income m m m m Carried interest receivable 53 28 53 28 Fees receivable from external funds 28 31 Group Group Company Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 Statement of financial position m m m m Carried interest receivable 87 33 87 33 In addition, the Group has invested in the 3i Global Income Fund.
At 31 March 2016, the value of the investment was 52 million.
The Group received management fees of less than 1 million in the year 2015: nil.
Investments The Group makes investments in the equity of unquoted and quoted investments where it does not have control but may be able to participate in the financial and operating policies of that company.
It is presumed that it is possible to exert significant inuence when the equity holding is greater than 20%.
The Group has taken the investment entity exception as permitted by IFRS 10 and has not equity accounted for these investments, in accordance with IAS 28, but they are related parties.
The total amounts included for investments where the Group has significant inuence but not control are as follows: Company Group Group Company 2015 2016 2015 2016 restated Statement of comprehensive income m m m m Realised profit over value on the disposal of investments 4 13 4 1 Unrealised profits on the revaluation of investments 42 3 15 14 Portfolio income 37 26 12 17 Company Group Group Company 2015 2016 2015 2016 restated Statement of financial position m m m m Unquoted investments 480 560 341 416 From time to time, transactions occur between related parties within the investment portfolio that the Group inuences to facilitate the reorganisation or renancing of an investee company.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 132 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 29 Related parties and interests in other entities continued Unconsolidated structured entities The application of IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure on the Groups exposure to unconsolidated structured entities.
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines.
These structured entities fall into four categories, namely CLOs, debt management warehouses, closed end limited partnerships Private Equity and Infrastructure funds and investments in certain portfolioinvestments.
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities andthe maximum exposure to loss.
CLO structured entities The Group manages CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business.
These funds predominantly invest in senior secured loans and are nanced by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns.
The Group manages these funds in return for a management fee.
The Group also typically invests into the equity tranche of these funds.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and performance fees are accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Groups involvement with these entities are summarised below: Carrying amount Maximum loss Assets Liabilities Net exposure Balance sheet line item of asset or liability m m m m Unquoted investments 154 154 154 Fee income receivable 7 77 Total 161 161 161 At 31 March 2015, the carrying amount of assets and maximum loss exposure of unquoted investments and fee income receivable was119 million and 7 million respectively.
The carrying amount of liabilities was nil.
At 31 March 2016, the total CLO assets under management were 7.1 billion 2015: 6.5 billion.
The Group earned distributions of31 million 2015: 16 million and fee income of 33 million 2015: 30 million during the year from CLO structured entities.
Warehouse structured entities Ahead of future CLO fund launches, warehouse facilities are usually established to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios.
These entities are nanced by the Group along with the bank appointed to operate the warehouse facility.
The Group makes a commitment to the warehouse, typically taking the first loss position and is at risk for margin calls if the portfolio underperforms.
The Groups attributable stakes in these warehouses are held at fair value.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Groups involvement with these entities are summarised below: Carrying amount Maximum loss Assets Liabilities Net exposure Balance sheet line item of asset or liability m m m m Unquoted investments 17 17 17 Total 17 1717 At 31 March 2015, the carrying amount of assets and the maximum loss exposure of unquoted investments was 43 million.
The Group earned interest income of 4 million 2015: 6 million during the year from warehouse structured entities.
Closed end limited partnerships The Group manages a number of closed end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return for a management fee.
The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital appreciation.
Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, finance these entities by committing capital to them andcash is drawn down or distributed for nancing investment activity.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried interest is accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.

The Group earned fee income of 28 million 2015: 31 million and carried interest of 53 million 2015: 28 million in the year.
Investments that are structured entities The Group makes investments on behalf of itself and third-party funds that it manages, for capital appreciation purposes.
In a small number of cases, these investments fall under the classication of a structured entity as they are funds managed by the General Partner under a limited partnership agreement.
The Groups attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value.
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Groups involvement with these entities are summarised below: Carrying amount Maximum loss Assets Liabilities Net exposure Balance sheet line item of asset or liability m m m m Unquoted investments 2 22 Total 2 22 At 31 March 2015, the carrying amount of assets and the maximum loss exposure of unquoted investments was 2 million.

TheGroup recognised an unrealised movement of nil 2015: 1 million loss from investments that are structured entities.
Regulatory information relating to fees: Under AIFMD, 3i Investments plc acts as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager AIFM to 3i Group plc.
In performing the activities and functions of the AIFM, the AIFM or another 3i company may pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary benets to or from third parties of the following nature: Transaction fees: 3i companies receive monitoring and Directors fees from portfolio companies.
The amount is agreed with the portfolio company at the time of the investment but may be re-negotiated.
Where applicable, 3i may also receive fees on the completion of transactions such as acquisitions, renancings or syndications either from the portfolio company or a co-investor.
Transaction fees paid to 3i are included in portfolio income.
Payments for third-party services: 3i companies may retain the services of third-party consultants: for example, for an independent director or other investment management specialist expertise.
The amount paid varies in accordance with the nature of the service and the length of the service period and is usually, but not always, paid reimbursed by the portfolio companies.
The payment may involve a at fee, retainer or success fee.
Such payments, where borne by 3i companies, are usually included in portfolio income.
Payments for services from 3i companies: One 3i company may provide investment advisory services to another 3i company and receive payment for such service.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 134 Financial statements Notes to the accounts 30 Subsidiaries and related undertakings IFRS 10 has reduced the requirements for an entity to be classied as an accounting subsidiary and deems wider control, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries.
Under IFRS 10, if the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee, then it has control and hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary.
This is inconsistent with the UK Companies Act where voting rights are the key determinant when identifying accounting subsidiaries, with a larger than 50% holding of voting rights resulting in an entity being classied as a subsidiary.
