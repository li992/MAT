FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 30 September 2016 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Countryside Properties PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded on the LondonStock Exchange.
The Companys registered office is Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex CM13 3AT.
The Groups principal activities are building new homes and regeneration of public sector land.
The parent company financial statements are on pages 117 to 124.
Initial Public Offering IPO The Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 17 February 2016.
These are the first full set of consolidated financial statements of Countryside Properties PLC following the reorganisation of the Group to facilitate the IPO.
The reorganisation is described below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the merger method of accounting because the transaction under which the Company became the holding company of OCM Luxembourg Coppice Midco S. r. l. Midco was a Group reconstruction with no change in the ultimate ownership of the Group.
All the shareholdings in Midco were exchanged via a shareforshare transfer on 11 February 2016.
The Company did not actively trade at the time.
The result of the application of the capital reorganisation is to present the financial statements as if the Company had always owned the Group the financial statements, including comparatives, have been presented as a continuation of Midco.
The prior year financial statements for Midco are available in the Prospectus, prepared for the purpose of the IPO, which is available on the Groups website: investors.
Group reorganisation The principal steps of the Group reorganisation were as follows: The Company was incorporated on 18 November 2015 as a public company limited by shares in the United Kingdom, with share capital of 1, consisting of one ordinary share with a 1 nominal value.
On 19 November 2015, the Company issued a further nine ordinary shares and 50,000 redeemable preference shares, each of 1.
The Company became the ultimate holding company of the Group with Midco becoming the Companys direct subsidiary on 11 February 2016 by way of a shareforshare exchange.
The insertion of the Company as a new holding company constitutes a Group reorganisation and the transaction is accounted for as a capital reorganisation and merger relief applied in accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
The balance of outstanding mandatory redeemable preference shares of 287m and the associated accrued return of 111m as of 16 February 2016 was transferred from the holders being OCM Luxembourg Coppice Topco S. r. l. being an entity controlled by Oaktree Capital Management L. P. and certain members of the Groups management to the Company in exchange for 392 million ordinary shares in the Company, each of 1.
Under merger relief the shares issued in this transaction were recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position at the nominal value of the shares issued plus the fair value of any additional consideration, which was recorded as a merger reserve in the Group financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are consolidated at book value in the Group financial statements and the consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and merger reserve of the Company as if it had always existed.
On 17 February 2016 the Company issued 57,777,778 additional shares, each of 1, for consideration of 130m, the balance being recorded as share premium, in an IPO.
As permitted by Section 610 2b of the Companies Act 2006, 4.6m of the IPO costs have been charged to the share premium account.
Themandatory redeemable preference shares were redeemed on IPO.
On 9 March 2016, the Company undertook a courtapproved capital reduction, in which the nominal value of the ordinary shares was reduced to 0.01 each, which had the effect of reducing the merger reserve and share premium arising on IPO to Nil.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the Groups financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates andassumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have asignificant impact on the financial statements, apart from those involving estimates which are described below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and underlying assumptions affecting the financial statements are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on anongoing basis.
This approach forms the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value ofassets and liabilities are described below.
Estimation of site profitability In order to determine the profit or loss that the Group recognises on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period, the Group allocates the total cost of each development, and construction contract between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period.
The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation due to the longterm nature of the Groups activities and because actual costs are subject to market fluctuations.
Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual contract basis.
com NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 30 September 2016 2.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES CONTINUED Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Carrying value of inventory Inventory generated through the normal course of business is recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
A financial appraisal is prepared and updated monthly for each development, which records an estimate of future revenues and expenditure.
As both future cost and sales prices fluctuate in line with local market conditions, significant adverse variances in either costs or sales prices estimates could lead to an impairment of inventory.
In circumstances where forecast revenues are lower than anticipated expenditure, an inventory provision is made.
This inventory provision may be reversed in future periods when there is evidence of improved selling prices or reduced expenditure forecast on a development.
Available-for-sale financial assets Availableforsale financial assets comprise loans that have been advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under historical shared equity schemes.
The loans are secured by either a first or second charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from thefifth year onwards.
The loans are held at fair value, which is based on an estimate of the future cash flows from the loans.
The estimate considers the value of the property based upon market conditions, including potential future house price increases, and possible borrower default.
The loans are discounted at an interest rate equivalent to that which would be payable for loans made against property by a third party.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation These financial statements for the year to 30 September 2016 are those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.
It has been prepared in accordance with the IFRS as endorsed by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in Sterling and rounded to the nearest thousand pounds under the historical cost convention, except for availableforsale financial assets and sharebased payments.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 39.
Thefinancial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report.
Furtherdisclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 23.
As described in the Viability Statement, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a threeyear period to September 2019.
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those risks that would threaten Countrysides business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Having considered these forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct itsbusiness and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months.
Accordingly these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
New standards, amendments and interpretations With the exception of the above, no new standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2015 have had a material impact on the financial statements.
During the IFRS period the Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify an issue related to IAS 32: Financial Statements: Presentation in connection with whether particular cash pooling arrangements meet the requirement for offsetting in accordance with IAS 32.
Following the observations published by the Interpretations Committee the Group has reassessed the treatment of its cash pooling arrangements and concluded that the comparative financial information should be represented compared to the financial information for the year ended 30 September 2015 and 30 September 2014 as disclosed in the Prospectus.
This also had the impact of increasing the amount of cash and cash equivalents reported inthe cash flow statement from 354,000 to 80,835,000.
There was no impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
84 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED New standards, amendments and interpretations continued The following amendments to standards and interpretations which will be relevant to the preparation of the Groups financial statements have been issued, but are not effective and have not been early adopted for the financial year beginning 1 October 2016: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, on Classification and Measurement effective 1 October 2018.
This is the first part of a new standard on classification and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
Otherwise it is at fair value through profit or loss.
Amortised cost accounting will also be applicable for most financial liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives.
The main change is that in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part ofa fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 October 2018.
This standard will replace both IAS 18, which covers contracts forgoods and services, and IAS 11, which covers construction contracts.
The basis for IFRS 15 is revenue is now recognised when control of a good orservice is transferred toa customer, which replaces the existing treatment of risks and rewards.
Under the new standard, revenue is also allocated toseparate performance obligations under a contract and revenue is recognised once the performance obligations are met.
IFRS 16 'Leases' effective 1 October 2019 redefines how an entity will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard requires lessees to recognise all leases as assets, unless the underlying asset has a low value, or the lease term is one year or less.
Amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 12 effective 1 October 2018.
These amendments require additional disclosures in the statement of cash flows andrecognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses respectively.
Amendment to IFRS 2 effective 1 October 2018.
This amendment clarifies the measurement for cashsettled, sharebased payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash settled to equity settled.
It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 thatwillrequire an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's taxobligations associated with a sharebased payment and pay that amount to the tax authority.
Amendment to IFRS 15 effective 1 October 2018.
These amendments comprise clarifications of the guidance on identifying performance obligations, accounting forlicences of intellectual property and the principal versus agent assessment gross versus net revenue presentation.
There are no IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group for the financial year beginning 1 October 2016.
The Group has not applied the following amendments to standards which are EU endorsed but not yet effective: Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements on the Equity Method Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 Cycle The Group is currently considering the impact of these amendments on the Group: however, it is anticipated they will be minimal and effects will principally relate to the amendment of current disclosures.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities which the Group has the power to control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting from the date on which control is obtained up until the date that control ceases.
Noncontrolling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the income statement, the statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position.
Where the accounting policies of a subsidiary or equityaccounted investee do not conform in all material respects to those of the Group, adjustments aremade on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the financial statements.
Gains arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
com NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 30 September 2016 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Associate and joint ventures An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.
Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in the associate and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the postacquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associate and joint ventures are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence ofan impairment of the asset transferred.
The Group funds its associate and joint ventures through a combination of equity investment and shareholder loans.
The Directors review the recoverability of investments and shareholder loans for impairment annually.
Where an investment is held in an associate which has net liabilities, the investment is held at Nil and other longterm interests, such as shareholder loans, are reduced by the value equal to the net liabilities, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of its associate or joint ventures.
Business combinations All acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value ofthe asset or liability resulting from a deferred and contingent consideration arrangement.
Costs directly relating to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement.
The identified assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the aggregate fair value of the Groups share of the net identified assets plus identified intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary over the interest in net fair value of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
If the total consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly inthe income statement.
An impairment review is carried out annually or when circumstances arise that may indicate an impairment is likely.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units CGUs, or groups ofCGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Brands The Group carries assets on the balance sheet for brands that have been acquired.
Internally generated brands are not recognised.
Cost is determined at acquisition as being directly attributable cost or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation method.
Acquired brands are tested for impairment when a triggering event is identified.
Acquired brands are amortised over a period of 20 years.
Software Computer software that generates an economic benefit of greater than one year is recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Computer software costs that are recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their economic useful life of four years.
These are reviewed for impairment at such time as there is a change in circumstances by which the carrying value may no longer be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any applicable impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged at rates to write off the cost of the asset on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The applicable annual rates are: Plant and machinery 20per cent to 25per cent Fixtures and fittings 10per cent The Group does not own any land or buildings considered to be nontrade related.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables: and available for sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Financial assets continued Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included incurrent assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as noncurrent assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Available-for-sale financial assets Availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Equity share scheme loans are classified as availableforsale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs.
Fair value is assessed annually with gains and losses being recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income until the loan is repaid.
The loans are discounted at an interest rate equivalent to market rate.
On repayment the accumulated fair value, which had been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, is recognised in the Income Statement.
If a loan is determined to be impaired, any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Increases in the fair value of availableforsale assets are initially deferred and recorded within reserves.
Reductions in the fair value of availableforsale assets are recorded as a reduction in reserves, to the extent available, with any additional reduction recorded in the Income Statement.
The net deferral of increases in fair value are disclosed in the availableforsale reserve.
Inventories Inventories are normally stated at cost or fair value if acquired as part of a business combination and held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials, applicable direct labour and those overheads incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition.
Netrealisable value represents estimated selling price less all estimated costs to sell, including sales and marketing costs.
Land options purchased are initially stated at cost.
Option costs are written off over the remaining life of the option and are also subject to impairment review.
Impairment reviews are performed when circumstances arise which indicate an impairment is likely, such as a refusal of planning permission.
Any impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Land inventory is recognised when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the Group after unconditional exchange of contracts.
Whereland is purchased with deferred payment terms, a corresponding liability is recognised within trade and other payables.
Precontract expenditure is capitalised where it is probable that a contract will be signed or otherwise is recognised as an expense within costs of sales inthe Income Statement.
Provisions for inventories are made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when the carrying value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
The carrying value of the receivable is reduced and any impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
If collection is expected in one year orless or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer, receivables are classified as current assets.
If not, they are classified as noncurrent assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other shortterm deposits held by the Group with maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at their fair value and subsequently amortised cost.
Where land is purchased on deferred settlement terms the land and associated liability are discounted to their fair value.
The discount to fair value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Changes in estimates of the final payment due are capitalised into inventory and, in due course, to cost of sales in the Income Statement.
Trade payables also include liabilities in respect of land overage where the Group is committed to make contractual payments to land vendors related to theperformance of the development in the future.
Land overage is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation to relevant developments and, where payment will take place in more than one year, is discounted.
Deposits received from customers relating to sales of new properties are classified within current trade payables.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are classified as noncurrent liabilities.
Borrowings Interestbearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value and bank loans are reported net of direct transaction costs to the extent that borrowings areavailable for offset.
Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement orredemption, are amortised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
The excess of unamortised borrowing costs is disclosed within prepayments.
Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position.
Overdrafts are classified as current liabilities.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted at the pretax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the foreseeable net cash outflows on a lease exceed the benefits derived from the lease which has more than one year before expiring or option to exercise a break.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.
Where any Group company holds shares in the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Mandatory redeemable preference shares Mandatory redeemable preferred shares were interestbearing financial liabilities which were recorded at their fair value.
Such instruments are carried at their amortised cost with returns recognised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
The Mandatory Redeemable Preference Shares were all settled as part of the preIPO reorganisation as described in Note 1.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of applicable value added tax, Stamp Duty Land Tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue and profit are recognised as set out below.
Private housing Revenue is recognised in the income statement on legal completion at the fair value of the consideration received.
Part exchange In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property.
The fair value is established by independent surveyors, reduced for cost to sell.
Net proceeds generated from the subsequent sale of partexchange properties are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.
Theoriginal sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.
Cash incentives Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction to revenue.
Land and commercial sales Revenue is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the land or commercial property transfer to the buyer, generally whenthere is an unconditional exchange of contracts.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Affordable housing contracts and design and build contracting Contract revenue and costs are recognised in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Where the outcome of a longterm contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a longterm contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it isprobable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales.
Project management services Revenue earned for the provision of project management services, typically to the Groups joint ventures and associate, are recognised on an accruals basisinline with the underlying contract.
Cost of sales For sales of private housing, the Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales based on the total budgeted cost of developing a site.
Once the total expected costs of development are established they are allocated to individual plots to achieve a build cost per plot.
These costs are recognised within cost of sales when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy.
To the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the site progresses, these are recognised over the remaining plots unless they are specific toaparticular plot, in which case they are recognised in the income statement at the point of sale.
For land and commercial property sales, cost of sales represents the carrying value of the related inventory on the Groups balance sheet and this is recognised within cost of sales when revenue is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy.
As outlined above, costs in relation to the sale of affordable housing and design and build contracts are recognised in accordance with IAS 11.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable and incentives receivable under operating leases are recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Finance costs and finance income Borrowing costs Borrowing costs in relation to the Groups debt facility are recognised on an accruals basis.
Also included in borrowing costs is the amortisation of fees associated with the arrangement of the financing.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument tothe extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group does not capitalise borrowing costs into developments.
Unwind of discounting The finance cost associated with the time value of money on discounted receivables and payables is recognised within finance costs as the discount unwinds over the life of the relevant item.
88 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Current and deferred income taxation Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Current taxation The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax ismeasured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in comprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity, or items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
Segment reporting Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments.
Segmental reporting reflects the Groups management structure and primary basis of internal reporting.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The chief operating decisionmaker CODM has been identified as the Groups Executive Committee.
The CODM reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on underlying operating profit and tangible net operating asset values TNOAV.
Pension obligations The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group provides benefits to employees including Directors of the Group in the form of equitysettled and cashsettled sharebased payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares.
For equitysettled sharebased payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions.
All share options are valued using an optionpricing model Black Scholes or Monte Carlo.
This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the sharebased payment scheme.
For cashsettled sharebased payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised through the income statement over the vesting period of the sharebased payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in accruals.
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.
Countryside Properties PLC invoices its subsidiary undertakings an amount equivalent to the fair value of the grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiaries.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Adjusted measures Certain items which do not relate to the Groups underlying performance are presented separately in the Income Statement as nonunderlying items where, in the judgement of the Directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying business performance.
As these nonunderlying items can vary significantly from year to year they create volatility inreported earnings.
In addition, the Directors believe that in discussing the performance of the Group, the results of joint ventures and associate should beproportionally consolidated, including the Groups share of revenue, operating profit and TNOAV given their importance to the Groups operations.
As such, the Directors believe that the adjusted revenue, adjusted Group operating profit and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business for shareholders.
Adjusted Group operating profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted or underlying profit measures of other companies.
Examples of material and nonrecurring items which may give rise to disclosure as nonunderlying items are: fees incurred in relation to business combinations or capital market transactions: adjustments to the statement of financial position that do not relate to trading activity such as the recognition and reversal of nontrade impairments: and accelerated writeoff of unamortised issue costs on the refinancing of borrowings.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Adjusted measures continued Sharebased payment charges in respect of the preIPO Management Incentive Plan established during the year ended 30 September 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Copthorn Holdings Limited and its subsidiary companies by Oaktree Capital Management LLC are also treated as a nonunderlying item.
This allows the underlying performance of the Group to be measured from period to period, due to that fact the full benefits of owning these shares are crystallised only following an exit event, such as the IPO.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue from the date of the IPO to 30 September 2016.
The weighted average number of shares for both the current and preceding years has been stated as if the Group reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the comparative year.
When calculating diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 0.2 million of potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees under the Groups Save As You Earn plan.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Movement in intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Copthorn Holdings Group in April 2013 19,297,000 and Millgate Developments in February 2014 18,527,000.
Both entities are considered to be cash generating units CGUs.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined as the value in use of the business assessed on the current fiveyear cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are based on achieving the Groups medium term targets of 17 per cent operating margin and 28 per cent ROCE with appropriate growth rates applied in following years.
Cash flow beyond the fiveyear period is extrapolated using a growth rate of 2per cent.
Cash flows generated by both CGUs are discounted using a pretax discount rate of 12.5per cent, approved by the Board ofDirectors.
The cash flow forecasts are also sensitised for a slowdown in sales and a reduction in selling prices.
Significant headroom exists on all sensitised forecasts given the relative size of goodwill compared to annual operating profits and cash flows.
Brand Brand relates to both the Countryside brand 13,500,000, acquired as part of the Copthorn Holdings Group in 2013, and the Millgate brand 10,700,000, acquired as part of Millgate Developments Limited in 2014.
Both brands have been valued using the income method and are considered tohave a useful economic life of 20 years.
Amortisation expense in respect of the Groups brands of 1,201,000 2015: 1,201,000 has been charged to administrative expenses.

Theloans are secured by either a first or second legal charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from the fifth year onwards or tenth year onwards, dependent upon the scheme under which the loans were issued.
The assets are held at fair value, which represents the current market value of the properties held discounted to fair value, based on the redemption date of the loan.
These loans are subject to credit risk, where loans may potentially not be repaid if the borrower defaults on repayment.
An adjustment for credit risk is built into the calculation by using a discount rate equivalent for home loans, which rank behind mortgages.
None of these financial assets are either past due or impaired.
100 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS CONTINUED The estimated value takes into consideration movements in house prices, the anticipated timing of the repayment of the asset and associated credit risk.
Asthe precise valuation and timing of the redemption of these assets remains uncertain, the Group applies assumptions based upon current market conditions and the Groups experience of actual cash flows resulting from these transactions.
These assumptions are reviewed at the end of each financial year as part of the impairment review conducted by the Directors.
The difference between the estimated future value and the initial fair value is credited tofinance income over the term of the loan.
Future house price inflation is assumed to be zero 2015: zero.
The discount rate applied is 8.5 per cent 2015: 8.5 per cent which the Directors believe approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties.
If UK house price inflation had been oneper cent higher or lower, with all other variables held constant and excluding any effect of current or deferred tax, the value of shared equity would increase or decrease by 139,000 2015: 90,000 respectively, whilst if the discount rate used had been oneper cent higher or lower, the value of these financial instruments would decrease or increase by 453,000 2015: 492,000 and 506,000 2015: 524,000, respectively.
Changes in economic conditions will change the estimates made, therefore impacting the fair value of these loans.
The inputs used are by nature estimated and the resultant fair value has been classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.

Theagreement has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and expires in May 2021, although the Group has the opportunity to extend the term of the facility by a further two years.
Subject to obtaining credit approval from the syndicate banks, the Group also has the option to extend the facility by a further 100,000,000.
This facility is subject to both financial and nonfinancial covenants and is secured by floating charges over all the Groups assets.
At 30 September 2015, the Group had a committed bank loan facility of 215,000,000 made available by Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC and SantanderUK plc.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Fair value estimation The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups assets that are measured at fair value at 30 September: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 2016 Assets Availableforsale financial assets 8,665 8,665 2015 Assets Availableforsale financial assets 10,535 10,535 There were no transfers between levels during the period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, overthecounter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entityspecific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Level 1: None of the Groups financial instruments are categorised as Level 1.
Level 2: None of the Groups financial instruments are categorised as Level 2.
Level 3: The key assumptions used in Level 3 valuations include house price movements, the expected timing of receipts, credit risk and discount rates.
The discount rate applied was 8.5 per cent 2015: 8.5 per cent which Directors believe approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties.
Techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, have been used to determine fair value for the Level 3 financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost is not shown, because the difference is not material.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The main financial risks associated with the Group have been identified as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, housing market risk and credit risk.
TheDirectors are responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity Company share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt bank loan facilities and, in 2015, mandatory redeemable preference shares.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring its existing facilities for both financial covenant and funding headroom against forecast requirements based on shortterm and longterm cash flow forecasts.

com NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 30 September 2016 29.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the market.
This risk arises from bank loans that are drawn under the Groups loan facilities with variable interest rates based upon UK LIBOR.
For the year ended 30September 2016 it is estimated that an increase by 0.5per cent ininterest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by 650,000 2015: 575,000.
The following table sets out the interest rate risk associated with the Groups financial liabilities at 30 September 2016: Noninterest Fixed rate Floating rate bearing Total 000 000 000 000 2016 Liabilities Bank loans and finance cost 26,340 26,340 Trade and other payables 32,180 182,698 214,878 Amounts due to joint ventures 310 310 32,180 26,340 183,008 241,528 2015 Liabilities Bank loans and finance cost 142,355 142,355 Mandatory redeemable preferred shares 287,329 287,329 Return on mandatory redeemable preferred shares 87,872 87,872 Trade and other payables 5,189 172,213 177,402 Amounts due to joint ventures 318 318 380,390 142,355 172,531 695,276 The financial assets of the Group amounting to 191,888,000 2015: 203,670,000 with the exception of cash and cash equivalents amounting to 38,301,000 2015: 80,835,000 are all noninterest bearing.
The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market.
These are in turn affected by the wider economic conditions such as mortgage availability and associated interest rates, employment and consumer confidence.
Whilst these risks are beyond the Groups ultimate control, risk is spread across business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographic regions in which it operates.
We have considered the sensitivity in relation to availableforsale financial assets, which is detailed in Note 15. Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited solely to the United Kingdom for housebuilding activities and by the fact that the Group receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
The Groups remaining credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans receivable from financial assets held for sale are those advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under the shared equity schemes.
The loans are secured by either a first or second charge over the property and are held at fair value.
Trade receivables on deferred terms arise from land sales.
The amount deferred is secured by a charge over the land until such time payment is received.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly the amounts receivable from the Homes and Communities Agency in relation to the HelptoBuy scheme, housing associations, joint ventures and the associate.
The Directors consider the credit rating of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are held with UK clearing banks which are either A or A rated.

The Group also aims to optimise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital with regard to the risks inherent in the business and the sector within which it operates by monitoring its actual cash flows against bank loan facilities, financial covenants and the cash flow forecasts approved by the Directors.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme continued Options granted during the year were valued using the Black Scholes optionpricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2016 Share price at date of grant p 240 Exercise price p 192 Volatility % 29 Option life years 3 Expected dividend yield % 3 Riskfree rate % 1 Fair value per option p 57 As the Company had no share price history prior to the grant of the options, the expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the share prices of other listed housebuilders for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years, on the assumption that 45 per cent of options will be cancelled over the service period as employees leave the Sharesave scheme based on the Groups experience of employee attrition rates.
