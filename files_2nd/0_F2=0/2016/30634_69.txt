Taxation This note explains how our Group tax charge arises.
The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.
Accounting policies Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability forcurrent tax is calculated using UK and foreign tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to theextent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Groups assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates and, specifically, in India these are usually resolved through the Indian legal system.
We consider each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, hold provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise.
However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Groups overall profitability and cash flows in future periods.

107 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6.
Taxation continued At 31 March 2016, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward are as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 610 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 56 44 82,630 82,730 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 278 51 18,887 19,216 334 95 101,517 101,946 At 31 March 2015, the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward were as follows: Expiring Expiring within within 5 years 610 years Unlimited Total m m m m Losses for which a deferred tax asset is recognised 104 64 87,246 87,414 Losses for which no deferred tax is recognised 1,124 543 16,084 17,751 1,228 607 103,330 105,165 Deferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg Included in the table above are losses of 64,186 million 2015: 70,576 million that have arisen in Luxembourg companies, principally as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
These losses do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of 18,931 million 2015: 20,755 million has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
The Luxembourg companies income is derived from the Groups internal financing and procurement and roaming activities.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond the forecast period under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The assessment also considered whether the structure of the Group would continue to allow the generation of taxable income.
Based on this the Group concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable income in the future.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 50 to 60 years.
A 5%10% change in the forecast income in Luxembourg would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by 26 years.
Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of losses, including the period over which the losses are utilised.
In February 2016 the Luxembourg Government announced their intention to reduce the corporate tax rate including municipal business tax to 27.1% for the year ending 31 March 2017 and 26.1% for the year ending 31 March 2018.
The announced decrease in the corporate tax rate would reduce the value of our deferred tax assets by approximately 2.1 billion.
During the current year we utilised 2,277 million of our deferred tax asset as a result of the revaluation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements at 31 March 2016 2015: recognition of an additional asset of 2,127 million.
The revaluation of investments for local GAAP purposes, which are based on the Groups value in use calculations, can give rise to impairments or the reversal of previous impairments.
These can result in a significant change to our deferred tax assets and the period over which these assets will be utilised.
During the year the Group fide-recognised a deferred tax asset of 930 million relating to losses in Luxembourg as a result of the absence of complete clarity on the tax treatment of certain revaluations of investments for Luxembourg GAAP purposes, combined with the length of time which would be likely to elapse before these losses would be utilised.
We also have 7,642 million 2015: 7,642 million of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany The Group has tax losses of 14,597 million 2015: 13,600 million in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000.
The losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of 2,260 million 2015: 2,086 million has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the German business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the German business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 22 to 28.
In the period beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the German business we believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 10 to 15 years.
A 5%10% change in the forecast profits of the German business would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by one year.
Deferred tax assets on losses in Spain During the 2015 year end, the Group acquired Grupo Corporativo Ono S. A. which had tax losses of 2,375 million in Spain and which are available to offset against the future profits of the Spanish business.
A deferred tax asset of 673 million 2015: 603 million has been recognised in respect of Onos losses as we conclude it is probable that the Spanish business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Spanish business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business see pages 22to 28.
In the period beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the value in use calculations and based on these and ourexpectations for the Spanish business we believe it is probable the losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 8 to 10 years.
A 5%10% change in the forecast profits of the Spanish business would not significantly alter the utilisation period.
