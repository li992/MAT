However, as BHP Billiton controls the Navajo mine until full consideration is received from the buyer, the financial results of the Navajo mine are consolidated by the Group.
The divestment of Navajo Coal completed on 29 July 2016 and will be recognised in FY2017.
BHP Billiton will continue to manage Navajo Coal in accordance with the Mine Management Agreement until 31 December 2016. b As the Group has the ability to direct the relevant activities at Minera Escondida Limitada, it has control over the entity.
The assessment of the most relevant activity in this contractual arrangement is subject to judgement.
The Group establishes the mine plan and the operating budget and has the ability to appoint the key management personnel, demonstrating that the Group has the existing rights to direct the relevant activities of Minera Escondida Limitada.
c The Group has an effective interest of 92.5 per cent in BHP Iron Ore Jimblebar Pty Ltd: however, by virtue of the shareholder agreement with ITOCHU Minerals & Energy of Australia Pty Ltd and Mitsui & Co. Iron Ore Exploration & Mining Pty Ltd, the Groups interest in the Jimblebar mining operation is 85 per cent, which is consistent with the other respective contractual arrangements at Western Australia Iron Ore. 28 Investments accounted for using the equity method The Groups interests in equity accounted investments with the most significant contribution to the Groups net profit or net assets are listed below.
For a complete list of the Groups associates and joint ventures refer to section 5.2.

Samarco Brazil Joint venture Iron ore mining 31 December 50.00 50.00 Voting in relation to relevant activities in Antamina and Cerrejn, determined to be the approval of the operating and capital budgets, does not require unanimous consent of all participants to the arrangement, therefore joint control does not exist.
Instead, because the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee, these investments are accounted for as associates.
Samarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda BHP Billiton Brasil and Vale S. A. Vale.
As the Samarco entity has the rights to the assets and obligations to the liabilities relating to the joint arrangement and not its owners, this investment is accounted for as a joint venture.
The Group is restricted in its ability to make dividend payments from its investments in associates and joint ventures as any such payments require the approval of all investors in the associates and joint ventures.
The ownership interest at the Groups and the associates or joint ventures reporting dates are the same.
When the annual financial reporting date is different to the Groups, financial information is obtained as at 30 June in order to report on an annual basis consistent with the Groups reporting date.
