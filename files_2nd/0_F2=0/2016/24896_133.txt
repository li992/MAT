Financial instruments Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows: cash and cash equivalents bank overdrafts, revolving credit facilities, bank loans and Private Placements trade receivables other receivables trade payables contingent and deferred consideration other creditors investments All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost, with the exception of contingent and deferred consideration and investments which are held at fair value.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to Level 1 or Level 2 and there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels during the period.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
The Group held the following Level 3 financial instruments at fair value.

Financial instruments continued Capital risk management continued Certain of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements from the Financial Conduct Authority.
Where such requirements exist, the Group manages the risk through the close monitoring of performance and distributable capital within the entities impacted by the regulations.
The Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank and other loans, overdrafts and cash and cash equivalents.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with objectives, targets and policies set by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Classification of financial instruments In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities set out above in Principal financial instruments, the Group also has financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 19, 22 and 23.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to the Groups long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows before discounting.
The actual payment profile of Other creditors is principally dependent upon the collection of the corresponding Other receivables from policyholders.
These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection.
Therefore, the actual cash flows may differ from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 20 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to reduce liquidity risk further.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, the revolving credit facilities, a loan in the USA and the Private Placements, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
