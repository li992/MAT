111 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2016 continued 8 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as described below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
The assets of the scheme are held in trust separate from the assets of the Group.
The trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continued to accrue benefits for service until the scheme was closed to future accrual on 28 February 2015.
The contributions paid during the year were 15.5m 2015: 24.7m which included contributions of 15.5m 2015: 15.1m to fund thepast service deficit.
Going forward, contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2013 valuation date.
TheGroupexpects to make contributions of 15.5m for funding the past service deficit in the year to 30 June 2017.
The Pension Protection Fund levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Other defined benefit schemes Acquired with the May Gurney group The May Gurney and TransLinc defined benefit schemes were acquired with May Gurney in the year to 30 June 2014.
Both of these definedbenefit schemes have closed to future accrual and the sum of the deficit contributions to both plans payable in the period to 30June 2016 amounted to 1.8m 2015: 0.3m.
Thetrustees are responsible fordecisions and holding the assets, and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investmentmanagers.
The TransLinc defined benefit scheme is associated with Kier FPS Limited, which was sold during the financial year see note 19.
The assets and liabilities of the TransLinc defined benefit scheme were transferred out of the pension liability and into assets liabilities held for sale at the end of the prior year.
An actuarial valuation of the May Gurney scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 31 March 2014 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 62.0m which represented approximately 83%of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in pensionable salaries.
Deficit contributions for the financial year to 30 June 2017 of 1.8m have been agreed with the trustees.
In total, the scheme currently has 372 deferred members and 278 retirees.
Acquired with the Mouchel Group The Group acquired a number of defined benefit pension schemes with the Mouchel Group.
At acquisition, the aggregate liability of theschemes was 68.6m.
The trustees are responsible for decisions and holding the assets, and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001.
The public sector comparable parts of the schemes are still open to future accrual, but the remainder was closed to future accrual in 2010.
There is a deficit recovery plan in place, requiring deficit contributions of7.8m in the year to 30 June 2017.
In total, the schemes currently have 58 active members, 2,903 deferred members and 1,361 retirees.
The Mouchel schemes were formally valued by the trustees independent actuaries as at 31 March 2013 and will need to be valued again in 2016.
Other defined contribution schemes Contributions are also made to a number of other defined contribution arrangements.
The Group paid contributions of 32.8m 2015:29.2m during the year to these arrangements.
The Group also makes contributions to local government defined benefit pension schemes in respect of certain employees who have transferred to the Group under TUPE transfer arrangements.
The Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis and consequently the pension costs for these schemes are treated asif they were defined contribution schemes.
IAS19 Employee Benefits disclosures The Group recognises any actuarial gains or losses through the statement of comprehensive income as required under IAS19.

When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the same method used to calculate theliability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared with the previous period.

The tax charge before non-underlying items and amortisation of contract rights of 22.5m 2015: 16.9m shown in the table above equates to an effective tax rate of 18% 2015: 20% on adjusted profit before tax of 125.3m 2015: 86.2m.
This effective rate islower than the standard rate of corporation tax of 20.0% 2015: 20.75% due to a number of items shown in the table above.
Thenon-deductible expenses mainly relate to acquisition costs on Mouchel and permanent differences on provisions.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, capital gains arising on disposal of certain investments, including some of the joint ventures disposed of during the year, are not subject to tax.
Tax relief on expenses not recognised in the income statement includes the impact ofthe tax deduction received in respect of the cost ofshares exercised under the Groups employee Save As You Earn Scheme and LTIP.
The net credit adjustment of 1.4m in respect of prior years results arises from differences between the estimates of taxation included inthe previous years financial statements and the actual tax liabilities calculated in the tax returns submitted to and agreed by HMRC.

c Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 2016 2015 m m Deferred tax expense including effect of change in tax rate Share of fair value movements on joint venture cash flow hedging instruments 0.2 Fair value movements on cash flow hedging instruments 0.2 Actuarial gains losses on defined benefit pension schemes 9.1 6.8 Total tax charge credit in the statement of comprehensive income 9.3 6.6 d Factors that may affect future tax charges Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were announced in the Chancellors Budget on 16 March 2016.
The change announced is to reduce the main rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 had already been substantially enacted on 26 October 2015.
As the change to 17% had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date their effects are not included in these financial statements.
The overall effect of that change, if it had applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by an additional 0.2m with 0.7m being credited to the income statement and 0.9m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
The deferred tax balance as at the year end has been recognised at 18%.
e Tax losses At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of 172.5m 2015: 177.3m available for offset against future profits.
Adeferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 23.3m 2015: 43.2m of income tax losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Thedividend totalling circa 40.7m will be paid on 2 December 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close ofbusiness on 30September 2016.
A scrip dividend alternative will be offered.

These balances have been subject to an annual impairment review based upon the projected profits of each cash generating unit CGU.
The cost of contract rights primarily relates to: The acquisition of the businesses and assets of the construction and business services operations of Sheffield City Council 21.3m, Harlow Council 0.8m, Stoke-on-Trent City Council 1.9m and North Tyneside Council 7.2m.

2 Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the reallocation of Mouchel Consulting from the Services division to the Construction division.
For impairment testing purposes the goodwill has been allocated to the above four CGUs.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill andintangibles has been determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow projections based on the Groups forecasts, approved by management, covering a three-year period.
The resulting cash flows are discounted to present value, with the discount rate used in the value in use calculations based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the assets being tested.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the forecast revenues and gross margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
Cash flows for periods beyond those forecast have a terminal growth rate assumption applied.
Significant headroom exists in all CGUs and management considers that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not lead to an impairment being recognised.
Services CGU A revenue growth rate of 2% and a fixed operating margin of 5% have been applied to the Services CGU cash flows into perpetuity.
These assumptions are in line with current trading and current forecasts of UK GDP growth rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.3% 2015: 10.0%.
Based on the value in use calculation, these assumptions derived a recoverable amount for the Services CGU that is 401m above the carrying value of CGU assets.
The Services CGU impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions: discount rate, revenue growth rate and the operating margin, although management do not consider that any reasonable possible change in any single assumption would give rise to an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
The assumptions would have to change as follows for any single assumption change to bring headroom down to nil: Discount rate increase from 9.3% to 13.0%: Growth rate reduce from positive 2% to negative 3.9%: and Underlying operating margin reduce from 5% to 2.6%.

The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are market conditions under IFRS2 Share-based Payment.
The performance conditions of the EPS element are non-market conditions under IFRS2.
The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded.
Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a true-up for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UKGovernment bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

131 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2016 continued 26 Guarantees and contingent liabilities There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including joint operations and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business.
Following recent changes in sentencing guidelines relating to breaches of safety, health and environmental legislation and regulation, the Directors considered whether it would be appropriate to include an additional provision in the financial statements relating to such breaches.
However, the Directors concluded that it was not currently possible to estimate with reasonable accuracy the amount of such a provision.
27 Financial instruments Capital risk management The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: to optimise the capital structure in order to minimise the cost of capital: and to maintain a strong balance sheet to support business development and tender qualification.
The four operating divisions of the Group have complementary capital characteristics, with the Construction division, and to a lesser extent the Services division, generating a net cash surplus, whilst the Property and Residential divisions require net capital to fund developments.
The Groups capital management strategy is to use a blend of capital types with different risk, return and maturity profiles to support the operating divisions and deliver the Groups capital management objectives.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2015.
The capital structure of the Group comprises: equity, consisting of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity: and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 20 and described further below.
The Group forecasts and monitors short, medium and longer-term capital needs on a regular basis and adjusts its capital structure as required through the payment of dividends to shareholders, the issue of new share capital and the increase or repayment of borrowings.
All investment decisions are made with regard to the Groups weighted average cost of capital and typically apre-tax annualised return of at least 15% is required to ensure such investments are value enhancing for shareholders.
Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise anypotential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury team manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating limits approved by the Board.
The treasury function isnot a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure tofluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
The Groups most significant clients are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the client.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to anyone counterparty are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts.
There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below: 1 2016 2015 m m Provision as at 1 July 14.3 2.3 Acquired in the year 11.9 Charged to the income statement 5.7 0.1 Provision as at 30 June 20.0 14.3 1 Restated for impact of revision to the acquisition accounting of the Mouchel Group, see note 30b to the financial statements.
There were 88.4m 2015: 109.1m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 43.2m 2015: 64.2m had been received by the end of August 2016.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2016 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.
The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2016 that were overdue for payment was 41.7% 2015:45.1%.
Credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: Construction 19 days 2015: 22 days Services 12 days 2015: 23 days Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to significant credit risk.
132 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report 145 Governance Report 4688 Financial Statements 89148 Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements and term loans to finance medium-term capital requirements, which carry interest at floating rates, at a margin over LIBOR.
The Groups borrowings, after the effect of derivatives, can be analysed as follows: 2016 2015 m m Fixed rate 276.2 182.7 Variable rate 30.0 214.9 Cost of raising finance 3.0 2.8 303.2 394.8 In addition, a number of the Groups joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps where there is significant interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where significant foreign currency exposures are identified, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts or swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a syndicate of relationship banks inthe form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The amount of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Derivative financial instruments During 2013 Kier Group plc entered into three cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on aUS dollar denominated loan, nominal value US$28m.
During 2014 Kier Group plc entered into four cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a US dollar denominated loan, nominal value US$116m.
During 2016 Kier Group plc entered into two cross-currency swaps to hedge the currency risk on a Euro denominated loan, nominal value 20m, and three interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on a GBP denominated loan, nominal value 58.5m.
These swaps continue to meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, how those cash flows will impact the income statement and the fair value of the related hedging instruments: Expected cash flows More than Fair value Total 01 years 12 years 25 years 5 years Continuing operations m m m m m m Cross-currency swaps: asset Gross settled inflows 163.0 5.2 5.2 15.2 137.4 Gross settled outflows 140.3 4.6 4.6 13.5 117.6 18.1 22.7 0.6 0.6 1.7 19.8 Interest rate swaps: liability Net settled 1.1 0.9 0.2 0.3 0.4 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI and property joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have atypical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2016 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 121.9m 2015: 123.4m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2016 amounted to 8.0m 2015: 22.0m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 1.4m 2015: 4.4m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting.
These derivatives are classified as level 2.
The prices of derivative transactions have been derived from proprietary models used by the joint ventures bank counterparties using mid-market mark to market valuations for trades between the joint ventures and those counterparties at the close of business on 30 June 2016.
