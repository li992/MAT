OVERVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17.
Asset lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
During the year borrowing costs of 7.3 million 2015 21.1 million have been capitalised on qualifying assets, at an average borrowing rate of 4.1%.
IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when any indicators of impairment are identified.
Most of the individual assets do not generate independent cash flows and as a result, for the purposes of impairment reviews, the assets are grouped into cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs of the waste management segment comprise individual assets which together constitute the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
The carrying value of these individual assets is compared to the recoverable amount of the CGUs, which is based predominantly on value-in-use.
Valueinuse calculations use the same base cash flow projections used for testing goodwill note 15 and are derived by adjusting the Groups detailed budget and strategic plan which cover a period of seven years and are approved by the Board annually.
The key assumptions are the same as for the impairment testing of goodwill note 15.
To reflect changes in the waste market, including the structural decline of landfill, and the prominence of recycling and recovering value from waste, together with the reorientation of Viridors operations towards ERFs, the allocation of CGUs has been refreshed.
The updated allocations ensure CGUs reflect the lowest level of independent cash inflows.
Non-strategic landfill assets are considered separate CGUs as are landfill gas assets, with other remaining assets allocated to regional CGUs.
The result of this change in CGUs is an impairment of non-strategic landfill sites of 60.9 million and a 60.9 million reversal of assets, including strategic landfill sites and recycling assets, allocated to regional CGUs.
For certain CGUs the recoverable amount is determined by reference to the fair value less costs to sell of the underlying assets using external and internal valuations of property and equipment and managements estimate of disposal costs.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED For the purposes of disclosing the results of the impairment review the CGUs have been grouped together by asset class of non-strategic landfill CGUs or regional CGUs.
The key assumptions in the Groups detailed budget and strategic plan are the same as those used for testing goodwill note 15.
The assumptions applied to these cash flow projections are: Assumption Basis for assumption Discount rates have been determined based on an estimate of the waste Discount rate management segments weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the The pretax discount rate used for landfill is 9% different risk profiles of the segments business activities to the extent The pre-tax discount rate used for regional CGUs ranges from 7% - 10% that the cash flows have not already been adjusted.
Longterm growth rates 0.5% applied to overheads beyond the period of the detailed Ongoing efficiencies and benefits from economies of scale.
2.5% applied to other cash flows beyond the strategic plan period up to Based on forecasts of growth in waste management markets and the the end of the life of the assets on projected volumes.
Using management cash flow projections, a 1.5% increase in real longterm growth rate of overheads, or a 0.5% increase in discount rate, or a 0.5% reduction in the longterm growth rate of other cash flows, or a 5% reduction in overall net cash flows, with all other variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the impairment charge or impairment reversal in the year.
