Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance 127 Material completion of the business separation All four businesses operating independently of the Group at the completion of the managed separation.
There may be some cross-ownership, but such stakes would be purely as an investment e. g. 20% or less or as part of a clear process to separation.
In addition, the material completion of the managed separation includes the elimination of the plc costs.
Appropriate capitalisation The managed separation shall set the businesses up for success, including being appropriately capitalised in relation to both regulatory requirements and local market competitiveness.
Quality of transaction execution Quality assessment will reflect the balance of the key components of time, cost, risk and value: The time criteria will be considered with respect to certain transactions being critical to the future managed separation of other businesses.
Also, the current Group structure contains inherent risks which will be mitigated once separation is achieved and therefore it is important to prioritise speed of execution The cost criteria will be assessed against both the expected reduction of continuing plc costs at the completion of the managed separation and the management of transaction costs advisers, etc.
Lastly, these cost criteria also include the reduction in plc debt costs through the cost-effective management of plc debt The risk criteria include consideration of regulatory, reputational, investor and other non-financial impacts In addition, value will be considered in terms of whether the transaction was completed in a manner consistent with creating shareholder value over time.
Value enhancement will be captured through the Alignment with Shareholder Value measure.
The committee recognises that due to the complex, multi-faceted and interrelated nature of the managed separation objectives and criteria, to assess them it will need to track and report progress as the managed separation is executed, but ultimately reserve a final judgement regarding assessment of achievement of this objective until it is determined that the managed separation has been completed.
Performance of the underlying businesses 25% This performance condition is directly aligned with the strategic objective to deliver competitive financial performance in each of the businesses while they are part of the Group, in order to maximise the value creation opportunity on separation.
Each businesss performance will be measured against stretching profit growth and Return on Equity RoE measures for the period up to its separation from the Group OM Asset Management will be measured against profit growth only, with RoE measured in accordance with the methodology disclosed for each business in the Companys 2015 Annual Report The businesses are weighted in accordance with their relative value to the Group at the commencement of the managed separation objective see note below on business weighting Profit growth thresholds have been based on the principal three-year macroeconomic growth assumptions for each market Nominal GDP for South Africa and equity markets for the UK and US to ensure that management only realise value from this part of the plan if the businesses outperform these benchmarks For the South African businesses, the profit metric is established as a relative outperformance target to actual nominal GDP over the performance period to account for the economic uncertainty and align to market practice in the region The committee believes that these targets are stretching, taking consideration of the economic outlook and the relatively short period of time the businesses have had to realise returns on recent investments such as UAP and Quilter Cheviot.
They have been carefully constructed to ensure that value will only be realised from this element of the plan if business performance warrants it by generating real value over the period If the committee considers it necessary to review the financial targets under the discretion afforded in the New Policy, for reasons linked to the macroeconomic environment, the phasing of three-year growth plans relative to the timeframe taken to complete the separation of a business, or the reallocation of the Groups assets, it will do so with complete transparency and in a way that ensures that the targets are as equally relevant and stretching as originally intended.
Alignment with shareholder value 35% This performance condition is directly aligned with the strategic objective to unlock and create significant long-term value for shareholders through the managed separation and will be measured through relative total shareholder return TSR.
TSR for Old Mutual plc shareholders will be measured against a bespoke index derived from a peer group constructed from relevant peers of each of the businesses in their local markets Each individual business peer group will be weighted in accordance with the relative value of each business to the Group at the commencement of the managed separation see note below on business weighting TSR will be measured from the date of the strategy announcement using the 30-day average up to and including 1 1 March 2016 until the managed separation is completed When a transaction is completed for a business, its peer group will be down-weighted or removed from the index and the other peer groups will be re-weighted proportionately.
In the event of a demerger of a business, its TSR will be tracked relative to its peer group for a period of 180 days to align any short-term volatility in the demerged businesss share price to the outcome of the TSR metric Threshold has been set in line with the TSR of the bespoke peer group, ensuring that vesting can only be achieved for matching or exceeding the performance of the peers.
For achieving the threshold level of performance 25% vesting will be realised, recognising the performance required to meet or exceed the TSR of the peer groups.
Maximum vesting on this component will occur when TSR has outperformed the bespoke peer group by 7% per annum There will be maximum transparency through annual updates of performance and adjustments made to the index in the annual Directors Remuneration Report.
Business weighting The basis for calculating the weighting of the businesses was to use their relative estimated value on 1 1 March 2016 to the Group, using the market value of the listed businesses Nedbank and OM Asset Management and an average of comparable one-year forward price earnings multiples for the unlisted businesses OMEM and OMW.
The weighting ignored debt, plc costs and other plc assets.
