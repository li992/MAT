1 Board oversight and the Remuneration Committee The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Groups remuneration arrangements are equitable and aligned with the long-term interests of BHP Billiton and its shareholders.
In performing this function, it is critical that the Board is independent of management when making decisions affecting remuneration of the CEO, other members of the OMC and the Groups employees.
The Board has therefore established a Remuneration Committee to assist it in making such decisions.
The Committee is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors all of whom are independent.
To ensure that it is fully informed, the Committee regularly invites members of management to attend meetings to provide reports and updates.
The Committee can draw on services from a range of external sources, including remuneration consultants.

The use of remuneration consultants The Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate.
Remuneration consultants are engaged by and report directly to the Committee.
Potential conflicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration consultants are selected and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to and require their independence from BHP Billitons management.
The advice and recommendations of external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Director.

6 FY2016 STI performance outcomes The Board and Remuneration Committee have reviewed the Groups performance in FY2016 for the purposes of determining the CEOs STI outcome.
The dam failure at Samarco a non-operated joint venture in Brazil in November 2015 was a key consideration, along with the ongoing decline in commodity markets and its associated impact on our performance.
The Board and Remuneration Committee considered the STI scorecard set for the CEO and his performance against the KPIs, and also weighed up the events and external factors impacting the Groups performance as set out above.
Having considered all these elements holistically, the Board and Committee determined that the STI outcome for the CEO for FY2016 should be zero and exercised discretion to approve that outcome.
This outcome accorded with an indication the CEO had previously provided to the Remuneration Committee that he thought a zero STI outcome for FY2016 would be an appropriate alignment of his short-term remuneration outcome for FY2016 with the shareholder experience and the interests of the Groups other stakeholders.

A narrative description of each performance measure and the CEOs level of achievement, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, prior to the approval of a zero STI outcome, is shown below the table.

HSEC The HSEC targets in the original scorecard for the CEO are aligned to the Groups suite of HSEC five-year public targets as set out in BHP Billitons Sustainability Report.
As it has done for several years, the Remuneration Committee seeks guidance each year from the Sustainability Committee when assessing HSEC performance against the original scorecard targets.
The Sustainability Committee also offers its guidance on any matters outside the original scorecard targets which it considers the Remuneration Committee should take into account when finalising the outcomes.
Consistent with prior years, the Remuneration Committee then took a holistic view of how the Group had performed in critical areas, including considering the guidance provided by the Sustainability Committee.
The performance commentary below is provided against the original scorecard targets which were set on the basis of operated assets only.
While this commentary therefore does not include the impact of the dam failure at Samarco, this should not be read to diminish the significance of that event, which has clearly been a key consideration in the determination of the overall zero STI outcome for the CEO as described above.
Original Scorecard Targets Performance against the Original Scorecard Targets Fatalities, environmental and community incidents: Nil fatalities and The Sustainability Committee first considered HSEC performance against nil actual significant environmental and community incidents at operated the original STI scorecard KPIs, with the following observations: assets.

positive outcomes on the numbers of occupational illnesses being experienced.
Risk management: All commodity segments completed reviews of critical control designs and test plans for all material HSEC risks.
In addition, all commodity segments met critical control execution and critical control verification tasks targets.
There were no potential material risk events in which all critical controls were absent or failed in FY2016.
Health, environment and community initiatives: Greenhouse gas reduction targets set at the commencement of the year were exceeded in all commodity segments.
Water management projects were completed consistent with targets in most assets.
All occupational exposure and community targets were achieved by the assets.
Notwithstanding the performance against the original scorecard targets as set out above, the guidance offered by the Sustainability Committee to the Remuneration Committee was that the CEOs FY2016 STI HSEC component should be zero as a consequence of the Samarco dam failure.
In the absence of this, and of the Board and Committees approval of a zero STI outcome for the CEO for FY2016 as described above, it was considered that the performance against the HSEC KPI would have warranted an outcome for FY2016 of 23 per cent against the target of 25 per cent.
Underlying attributable profit UAP Underlying profit after taxation attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group UAP is the key KPI against which short-term incentive outcomes for our senior executives are measured and, in our view, is the most relevant measure to assess the financial performance of the Group for this purpose.
UAP is profit after taxation attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group which in past periods we have reported as a key KPI, excluding discontinued operations and exceptional items.
At the commencement of the financial year when the target is approved, attributable profit is equal to UAP as there are no exceptional items.
A description of UAP and how it reconciles to IFRS measures can be found in section 1.13.2.
When we are assessing managements performance we make adjustments to the UAP result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange movements and other material items to ensure that the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that are within the control and influence of the Group and its executives.
Of these, changes in commodity prices has historically been the most material due to volatility in prices and the impact on Group revenue.
Notwithstanding that UAP excludes exceptional items, the Remuneration Committee reviews each exceptional item to assess if it should be included in the result for the purposes of deriving the UAP STI outcome.

Adjusted for with a Threshold of US$1.6 billion and a Stretch of US$4.7 billion.

The adjustments made to ensure the outcomes The range between Threshold and Target is greater than that between Target appropriately reflect the performance of management for the year were: and Stretch for two main reasons.
Firstly, the Target figure is based on the Adjustments for movements in prices of commodities and exchange rates Groups approved annual budget, and it is the Groups practice to build an element of stretch performance into the budget.
Secondly, the Groups assets for operated assets: an addition to UAP of US$2.1 billion.

US$0.3 billion, mainly being the exclusion of the commodity price impacts of non-controlled equity accounted investments.
Having reviewed all FY2016 exceptional items as described in section 5.1.
6 note 2 Exceptional items, the Committee determined that the exceptional item in relation to the Samarco dam failure should be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining the UAP outcome.
This reduced UAP by US$2.2 billion.
The key driver of the UAP performance being below Threshold at US$1.4 billion was the financial impact of the Samarco dam failure.
Other factors impacting UAP during FY2016 included variable production performance across the different commodity segments, with overall volumes below target, mainly in iron ore.
Cost performance during the year was positive against the targets set for the Group, with most commodity segments exceeding or meeting expectations in this regard.
There was improvement in our fundamental productivity drivers, although this will remain a key focus for FY2017.
The performance against the financial KPI resulted in an outcome for FY2016 of zero per cent against the target of 40 per cent regardless of the Board and Committees approval of a zero STI outcome for the CEO for FY2016 as described above.
Capital project management Capital project management measures based on the cost and the schedule outcomes for major capital projects in execution are considered to be effective measures of the delivery of our project pipeline, and consistent with other companies in our sector.
To ensure that we appropriately measure outcomes that are within the control and influence of the Group and its executives, relief is provided for exchange rate impacts on non-US$ project costs.
Consistent with last year, the Committee also considers qualitative factors such as performance on commodity segment-level projects, post commissioning performance, capital expenditure efficiency, progress to plan of development projects, relative capital performance against competitors and variations to prior Board approvals.
Original Scorecard Targets Performance against the Original Scorecard Targets In respect of FY2016, the Board determined a Target cost of US$8.6 billion, The outcome of US$8.0 billion on cost which, when adjusted for foreign exchange with a Threshold of US$9.5 billion and a Stretch of US$8.0 billion.
A Target movements, equated to US$8.6 billion, and the outcome on schedule of 41.7 months, was determined for schedule of 42.3 months, with a Threshold of were both largely in line with Target.

Favourable The ranges between Threshold and Target are greater than those between progress against schedule was observed on some projects in Copper and Petroleum.
Target and Stretch, as cost and schedule have a greater opportunity for overspend and or overrun to occur, than the lesser and finite probability of outcomes ahead of Target.
In the absence of the Board and Committees approval of a zero STI outcome for the CEO for FY2016 as described above, it was considered that the performance against the capital project management KPI would have warranted an outcome for FY2016 of 10 per cent against the target of 10 per cent.
Individual performance measures for the CEO Individual measures for the CEO are determined at the commencement of the financial year.
The application of personal, qualitative measures remains an important element of effective performance management.
These measures seek to provide a balance between the financial and non-financial performance requirements that maintain our position as a leader in our industry.
Original Scorecard Targets Performance against the Original Scorecard Targets The CEOs individual measures for FY2016 comprised contribution to FY2016 represented the completion of the third full financial year in the role BHP Billitons overall performance and the management team, and the by the CEO.
During FY2016, the CEO has contributed positively to the delivery of projects and initiatives within the scope of the CEO role as set performance of the Group and the OMC in a challenging year, implemented out by the Board, including strategy implementation, consolidation of a new simplified organisation structure following last years demerger of South32, relationships with key stakeholders, improvement in leadership capabilities delivered significant further productivity and capital expenditure improvements, and employee engagement throughout the Group, delivery of productivity strengthened our relationships with key stakeholders through successful initiatives and OMC member development and succession.
communication and collaboration, achieved uplifts in engagement, leading change, development and inclusion measures in the annual employee perception survey, and implemented the new Inclusion and Diversity Council to accelerate achievements in this critical area.
The CEO also has ensured there is a well-established talent management process with a strong slate of internal successors to OMC roles, with plans in place to provide additional experience and development.
Accordingly, the Committee is of the view the CEOs performance has been in line with the targets for individual measures set at the commencement of the year, as set out above.
In the absence of the Board and Committees approval of a zero STI outcome for the CEO for FY2016 as described above, it was considered that the performance against individual measures would have warranted an outcome for FY2016 of 25 per cent against the target of 25 per cent.

However, to ensure CONSOL Energy the CEO did not receive a larger number of awards as a result of the lower BHP Billiton share price since the Samarco dam failure in Brazil on 5 November Fortescue Metals 2015, the award size was determined by the Remuneration Committee by maintaining the share price and exchange rate of 5 November 2015 Freeport-McMoRan throughout the period from 6 November 2015 to the grant date.
This resulted 3 Glencore in a lower number of awards being allocated than would otherwise be the case.
The calculation therefore uses the actual daily close price for each MMC Norilsk Nickel trading day in the period from 4 December 2014 to 4 November 2015 and uses A$23.28 as the daily close price for each trading day from 5 November 2015 Peabody Energy to 3 December 2015.
This results in a 12-month average share price of A$26.38.

6 for a description of STI for FY2016, including the performance measures.
The performance measures set out in the table below have been set by the Remuneration Committee for the CEO in FY2017.
Performance measure Weighting Target performance HSEC 25% Fatalities, environmental and community incidents: Nil fatalities and nil actual significant environmental and community incidents.
Year-on-year improvement in trends for events with potential for such outcomes.
TRIF and occupational illness: Improved performance compared with FY2016 results, with severity and trends to be considered as a moderating influence on the overall HSEC assessment.
Risk management: Assets to have identified risks with material safety impacts, evaluated and recorded these risks in a system with controls in place and verified as part of Field Leadership activities.
Achieve 85% compliance for Critical Control Verification and Execution tasks.
Health, environment and community initiatives: All assets to achieve 100% of planned targets in respect of occupational exposure reduction, water and greenhouse gas, social investment, quality of life, community perceptions and community complaints.
UAP 45% UAP is profit after taxation attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group, excluding discontinued operations and exceptional items.
When we are assessing managements performance, we make adjustments to the UAP result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange movements and other material items to ensure that the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that are within the control and influence of the Group and its executives.
For reasons of commercial sensitivity, the target for UAP will not be disclosed in advance: however, we plan to disclose targets and outcomes retrospectively in our next Remuneration Report, following the end of each performance year.
In the rare instances where this may not be prudent on grounds of commercial sensitivity, we will explain why and give an indication of when they will be disclosed.
Individual performance 30% The CEOs individual measures for FY2017 comprise contribution to BHP Billitons overall performance and the management team and the delivery of projects and initiatives within the scope of the CEO role as set out by the Board, including strategy implementation, execution of growth aspirations as communicated externally, enhanced reputation of the Company, achievement of culture initiatives improvement in Company-wide leadership capabilities, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, delivery of productivity initiatives, delivery of latent capacity enhancement projects, positive progress on the Samarco Framework Agreement and OMC member development and succession.

13 Non-executive Directors remuneration in FY2017 In FY2017, the remuneration for the Non-executive Directors will be paid in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGMs.
Fee levels for the Non-executive Directors and the Chairman are reviewed annually.
The review includes benchmarking, with the assistance of external advisers, against peer companies.
Based on the most recent review, a decision has been made to hold fee levels constant for FY2017.
Fee levels will therefore remain at the reduced levels that took effect from 1 July 2015, when: the Chairmans fee was reduced by approximately 13 per cent from US$1.100 million to US$0.960 million per annum: and the Non-executive Director base fee was reduced by approximately six per cent from US$0.170 million to US$0.160 million per annum.
This years review also considered the benefits provided to Non-executive Directors and the Chairman.
A decision was made to disapply one of the benefits in the shareholder-approved remuneration policy.
For FY2017, the spouse partner travel benefit will not be used by Non-executive Directors or the Chairman, and the intention is to exclude it from the revised policy to be put to shareholders for approval in 2017.

20 OMC remuneration table The table below has been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting standards.
Where applicable, remuneration data for members of the OMC are pro-rated for the periods of FY2015 and FY2016 that they were KMP.
Steve Pastor joined the OMC and became KMP during FY2016 and there is no relevant FY2015 comparison.
Tony Cudmore, Tim Cutt, Dean Dalla Valle and Jimmy Wilson ceased being KMP during FY2016.
More information on the policy and operation of each element of remuneration is provided in prior sections of this Report.
Share-based payments The figures included in the shaded columns of the statutory table below for share-based payments were not actually provided to the KMP during FY2015 or FY2016.
These amounts are calculated in accordance with accounting standards and are the amortised IFRS fair values of equity and equity-related instruments that have been granted to the executives for FY2015 and FY2016 performance or that of prior financial years.
21 for information on awards allocated during FY2015 and FY2016.
A further explanation of the share-based payments terms used in the table is provided in the relevant footnotes.
No changes to salaries occurred during FY2016 except for Steve Pastor who was appointed to the OMC during the year on a base salary of US$0.800 million.
15 for base salary policy and operation.
2 Annual cash incentive is the cash portion of STI awards earned in respect of performance during each financial year for each executive or for the relevant period that they were KMP as set out above the table.
15 for STI policy and operation and FY2016 STI outcomes.
STI is provided half in cash and half in deferred equity which are included in the share-based payments columns of the table.
The minimum possible value awarded to each individual is nil.
The maximum STI is 240 per cent of base salary 120 per cent in cash and 120 per cent in deferred equity.
For FY2016, OMC members earned the following STI awards as a percentage of the maximum the remaining portion has not been earned i. e. has been forfeited : Andrew Mackenzie 0 per cent, Peter Beaven 17 per cent, Tony Cudmore 13 per cent, Tim Cutt 17 per cent, Dean Dalla Valle 16 per cent, Geoff Healy 15 per cent, Mike Henry 15 per cent, Daniel Malchuk 15 per cent, Steve Pastor 16 per cent, Athalie Williams 16 per cent and Jimmy Wilson 13 per cent.
3 Non-monetary benefits are non-pensionable and include such items as health and other insurances and fees for tax return preparation if required in multiple jurisdictions.
This item also includes the cost of domestic flights for Geoff Healy as part of approved commuting arrangements and travel for Mrs Mackenzie to accompany the CEO on business-related travel.
4 Other benefits are non-pensionable and included one-off international relocation allowances with no trailing entitlements provided to Peter Beaven and Athalie Williams in FY2015 and Danny Malchuk in FY2016.

BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 143 3 Remuneration Reportcontinued 3.4.
20 OMC remuneration table continued 6 The value of STI awards includes the estimated IFRS fair value of STI awards provided as deferred equity or cash-settled share-based payments under the GIS, GSTIP and STIP.
Awards may be paid in the form of cash where the individual ceases employment prior to the scheduled allocation date of the STI awards in December 2015 for FY2016 awards.
These share-based payments may also be forfeited after allocation in specific circumstances as described in section 3.3.
8 and therefore the minimum possible value of the awards is nil.
The maximum possible value cannot be determined as it depends on future share price movements, but is estimated by the IFRS fair value used for accounting purposes in this table.
The IFRS fair value of the STI awards is estimated at grant date by discounting the total value of the shares that will be issued in the future using the risk-free interest rate for the period to the date of award.
Participants who are provided with awards under the GIS and STIP are entitled to a DEP in lieu of the dividends that would have been payable on ordinary BHP Billiton shares over the period from the allocation date to the time they receive ordinary shares in BHP Billiton.
Prior to FY2011 awards, a similar DEP entitlement applied to GSTIP awards.
This is not the case with awards allocated since October 2011.
From FY2011, there was a change in accounting policy to account for the DEP from cash-settled to equity-settled.
STI awards are granted to OMC participants following the relevant AGMs awards to the CEO are subject to shareholder approval.
If employment ceases prior to that scheduled allocation of equity awards, the value of the awards may be provided in cash, but would still be included in this column of the table.
Once awarded, there is a vesting condition that requires participants to remain in employment for a further two years.
Accordingly, the number of securities if any that will ultimately vest cannot be determined until the service period has been completed.
The IFRS fair value of STI awards is apportioned to annual remuneration based on the expected future service period, which is normally three years being the performance year in which the STI is earned and the subsequent two-year service period.
The vesting of STI awards may be accelerated in the event of leaving the Group, in which case the expected future service period is amended.
The value of Shareplus awards includes the estimated IFRS fair value of rights to Matched Shares acquired during each share purchase period under the Shareplus program.
These rights are acquired on each of the quarterly share purchase dates under the program grant dates and the IFRS fair value is apportioned to annual remuneration based on the future service period required for the Matched Shares to be allocated i. e. the vesting date of the rights.
Where entitlements to the Matched Shares are accelerated on leaving the Group, the expected future service period is amended.
21 for the actual numbers of awards allocated to and held by members of the OMC.
7 The value of LTI awards includes the estimated IFRS fair value of awards provided under the LTIP, MAP and as Transitional OMC awards which are defined as equity-settled share-based payments.
The amount in respect of each award under the LTIP is the estimated IFRS fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology taking account of the performance condition, the term of the award, the share price at grant date, the expected price volatility of the underlying share, the risk-free interest rate for the term of the award and the value of the DEP that will be received on exercise of the award.
The IFRS fair value of each award is apportioned to annual remuneration in equal amounts to each of the years in the expected future service period, which is normally five years.
Where entitlements to LTI awards are preserved on leaving the Group, the expected future service period is amended.
This column also includes an amount allocated to remuneration in FY2015 and in FY2016 in respect of cash-settled share-based awards received by Mr Mackenzie on commencement of employment with BHP Billiton, which vested during FY2013.
The final value of the awards will be determined at the time that Mr Mackenzie chooses to redeem the award and this column will incorporate an annual true-up amount until that time.
For FY2016, the true-up value of Mr Mackenzies cash-settled share-based award is negative US$0.217 million and the equity-settled share-based awards are US$3.009 million.
Full details of the award and the relevant terms and conditions were provided in the FY2013 Annual Report.

The GSTIP has applied for the non-OMC management of BHP Billiton since the awards allocated in FY2009 for FY2008 performance.
The terms and conditions of the GSTIP awards are essentially the same as those provided under the STIP and the GIS.
Under each plan, participants must satisfy applicable STl performance conditions to be eligible for any award.
No DEP is payable on the GSTIP awards.
LTI awards under the MAP LTI awards that were held by the executives at the time that they were appointed to the OMC were allocated under the MAP which has applied for non-OMC management since FY2009.
As the primary purpose of the MAP is the retention of key senior management employees, the plan has no performance conditions after awards are granted and the vesting of MAP awards is subject to continued employment with the Group through to the vesting date as shown in the table.
Where a participant resigns or is terminated for cause prior to the vesting date, their unvested MAP awards are forfeited.
If a participants employment ends due to redundancy, retirement, death, illness or injury, a pro rata number of unvested awards will vest based on the portion of the relevant vesting period served.
No DEP is payable on the MAP awards.
Where awards lapse, the lapse date is shown.
If the vesting conditions are met, awards will vest on, or as soon as practicable after, the first non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June of the preceding year of vest.
The year of vest is the second STIP, GIS and GSTIP, third Transitional tranche one and MAP, fourth Transitional tranche two or fifth LTIP financial year after grant.
If the vesting conditions are not met then the awards will lapse.
All awards are conditional awards except for the GIS awards granted prior to December 2013 and all LTIP awards.
Conditional awards have no exercise period or expiry date: instead ordinary fully paid shares are automatically delivered upon the vesting conditions being met.
Where vesting conditions are not met, the conditional awards will immediately lapse.
The remaining awards are non-conditional awards which have an exercise period and an expiry date as follows: GIS awards granted prior to December 2013 the day prior to the third anniversary of the vesting date: LTIP awards the day prior to the fifth anniversary of the vesting date.
2 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the relevant date of grant.
No price is payable by the individual to receive a grant of awards.
The grant date IFRS fair value of the awards is estimated as at the start of the vesting period, being 1 July 2015 for awards granted during FY2016, and is as follows: STIP A$26.65: LTIP A$12.49: Transitional tranche one A$23.47: Transitional tranche two A$22.49: GSTIP A$24.48: MAP vesting date Aug 18 A$23.47: MAP vesting date Aug 19 A$22.49 and MAP vesting date Aug 20 A$21.56.
3 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the relevant date of vest.
4 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP Billiton shares on the date that the individual exercised their award.
No price is payable by the individual to exercise awards except for GIS awards granted in December 2010 where the individual elected to receive options.
5 The gain on awards is calculated using the market price on date of vesting or exercise as applicable less any exercise price payable.
6 Under the GIS each employee could nominate to receive a portion of their award in the form of options with a market-based exercise price.
The exercise price was determined by the weighted average price at which BHP Billiton shares were traded over the one week up to and including the date of grant.
The awards granted in December 2010 had an exercise price of 23.71 but were not exercised by Mr Mackenzie and lapsed on the scheduled expiry date.
7 Awards shown as held by Tony Cudmore, Tim Cutt, Dean Dalla Valle and Jimmy Wilson at 30 June 2016 are their balances held at 30 June 2016 and at the date they ceased being KMP.

22 Estimated value range of equity awards The current face value of STI and LTI awards allocated during FY2016 and yet to vest to be disclosed under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 is the number of awards as set out in the previous table multiplied by the current share price of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc as applicable.
The actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on and therefore fluctuates with the share prices of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc at the date that any particular award vests or is exercised.
