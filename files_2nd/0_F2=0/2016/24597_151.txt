Financial instruments, capital management and related disclosures continued At fair value The table below analyses financial assets carried at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy set out in Note 2.
Debtsecurities are valued by reference to the most recent observable market trade unless there is evidence of impairment.
Where such trades are not sufficiently regular for the sales to be classified as an open market, these are classified as level 2.
Investment funds relate to investments in a portfolio of assets that are valued in line with the valuation policies of the fund manager.
These comprise both level 1 and level 2 financial assets, and are therefore classified at level 2.

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial risks The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets and liabilities.
The most important components of financial risk for the Group are credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
129 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26.
Financial instruments, capital management and related disclosures continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full as they fall due.
The Group is exposed to credit riskthrough reinsurance assets, financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.
The Group manages its exposure to credit risk on high liquidity investments by pursuing a strategy whereby all investments in money market funds have credit ratings of AA or above.
The credit ratings of the Groups banks are monitored on a regular basis and, where there is adverse movement, appropriate action would be determined by the Boards Risk Committee.
Investment funds and debt securities are assessed by management to ensure that the level of credit risk is acceptable, credit ratings are sufficiently strong and that the investment is in line with the Groups investment policy.
The Standard & Poors or equivalent credit rating of the investment managers and banks with which the Group has significant credit risk, in relation to its investments in cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value, were as follows: Debt Investment Cash and cash securities funds equivalents Total m m m m As at 31 December 2016 AAA 69.0 6.0 119.9 194.9 AA 75.8 8.9 84.7 A 106.2 19.1 37.2 162.5 BBB 104.1 4.9 10.9 119.9 Less than BBB or unrated 9.6 9.6 Total 355.1 48.5 168.0 571.6 As at 31 December 2015 AAA 64.1 4.1 104.7 172.9 AA 68.3 8.6 24.3 101.2 A 42.3 33.1 23.2 98.6 BBB 89.9 1.2 88.7 Less than BBB or unrated 7.3 7.3 Total 264.6 51.9 152.2 468.7 The Standard & Poors or equivalent credit ratings of the Groups reinsurers are analysed below: As at 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m AA 512.6 337.2 A 308.5 210.3 BBB 0.9 Total reinsurance assets 822.0 547.5 The Group has investment guidelines that restrict the amount of the investment portfolio that can be placed with a single counterparty.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2016 is 1,750.1m 2015: 1,277.8m, being the carrying value of insurance and other receivables, reinsurance assets, financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.
Insurance receivables are monitored closely with a view to minimising the collection period of those items.
The Groups insurance receivables are an aggregation of small receivables and the Group uses multiple reinsurance providers to ensure that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Since other assets such as cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value are well diversified, the Directors believe that the Group does not hold any significant concentrations of risk.
Financial instruments, capital management and related disclosures continued Market risk The only significant market risk the Group is exposed to is interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is defined by the Group as the impact of unfavourable movements in market interest rates which consequently could adversely affect the values of financial assets and liabilities, or reduce future cash flows arising from them.
Cash and cash equivalents are held in current accounts or in short term money market instruments.
These are generally less than 60 days in duration, considerably reducing sensitivity to significant movements in interest rates compared to longer duration assets.
The Directors consider that the exposure to interest rate risk of cash and cash equivalents balances is immaterial for the purposes of sensitivity analysis.
The carrying value of the Groups financial assets at fair value are more susceptible to movements in interest rates.
Loans and borrowings are also exposed to movements in interest rates, incurring interest at rates pegged to LIBOR.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have reduced profit after tax and equity as follows: As at 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Equity 9.1 6.8 Profit after tax 1.8 1.0 The Group does not use derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure therefore a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would not further affect profit or loss.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to meet obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains significant holdings in liquid funds to mitigate this risk.
The Group makes use of regular forecasts to monitor and control its cash flow andworking capital requirements.
Financial liabilities are settled in line with agreed payment terms and managed in accordance with cash availability and inflow expectations.
All financial liabilities except loans and borrowings and an amount due to a reinsurer within insurance and other payables see Note 28 are due within 12 months.
Loans and borrowings are secured for a five year term and are due for repayment in 2020.
The assets backing insurance contract and other short-term liabilities held by the Group are considered to be more liquid than the related liabilities, and the Group is in a net current asset position.
The following table indicates the expected timing of net cash outflows resulting from insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets at the year end: 0-1 year 1-2 years Over 2 years Total m m m m As at 31 December 2016 Gross claims liabilities 545.4 293.3 368.1 1,206.8 Less reinsurance assets 344.8 197.1 243.4 785.3 Net cash outflows 200.6 96.2 124.7 421.5 As at 31 December 2015 Gross claims liabilities 296.6 166.8 448.7 912.1 Less reinsurance assets 145.7 83.1 318.7 547.5 Net cash outflows 150.9 83.7 130.0 364.6 131
