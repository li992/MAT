We have no significant concentration of credit risk, as our exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
We charge interest at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, we obtain a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then we set credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
We review credit limits regularly, and adjust them if circumstances change.
In the case of one-off customers, our policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
