Financial information Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group and Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for the Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in November 2014 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis compliant with the SORP.
As further described in the Strategic report on page 3, in the current period the Company agreed to transfer all but one of its investments to HarbourVest, and following this transfer it is the intention of the Board to distribute proceeds, once liabilities have been settled, to investors and put the Group into liquidation.
Therefore these accounts have been prepared on a liquidation basis rather than on a going concern basis.
Assets have been stated at their recoverable amounts and liabilities have been stated at their settlement values.
All non-current items have been reclassified as current items, and all expected liquidation expenses have been accrued at the period end.
In addition, and in order to safeguard the investment trust status of SVG Capital plc, the period end was changed from 31 January to 9 December, a date which coincides with the unconditional agreement to transfer the first tranche of investment assets to HarbourVest and the crystallisation of associated realised gains.
As a result of this reporting date change, performance for the current period is measured over a period of less than 12 months, compared to the 12 month period for the prior year results, and therefore amounts provided in these financial statements are not entirely comparable.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Presentation of income statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Groups contractual right to the cash flow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Groups business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction which would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
44 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 SVG Capital plc Interim Report 2016 Financial information 1 Accounting policies continued With the exception of one directly held unquoted investment, all of the Groups portfolio fund investments held at 9 December 2016 were sold and transferred to HarbourVest subsequent to the balance sheet date.
These fund investments are valued at 9 December 2016 at their recoverable amounts in line with the signed asset transfer deed with HarbourVest, which is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Investments in subsidiaries In line with IFRS 10, the Group consolidates subsidiaries that are not an investment entity and whose main purpose and activities are providing services that relate to the investment entitys investment activities.
Therefore, SVGC Managers Limited has been consolidated.
All other subsidiaries are measured at fair value in both the Groups and Companys accounts.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The liability component is accounted for as a borrowing.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans issued are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, areaccounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares Own shares represent SVG Capital plc shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts EBT to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans.
The EBTs are accounted for as extensions of the parent company.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments issued to employees of the investment manager are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts received or receivable for services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established and is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Revenue that has been earned, but the receipt of which is contingent on the occurrence of a future event, such as investors receiving a return of value, is only recognised when management judges the realisation of that income to be virtually certain.
The Groups revenue and realised capital gains are derived primarily from distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
Realised gains on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds, and on sale of investments are credited to the income statement and taken to the capital reserve.
Income distributions are credited to the income statement and taken to the revenue reserve.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 45 Financial information Notes to the accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued Administrative expenses Administrative expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Group and Company is pounds sterling, as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group and Company operate.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of thetransactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities and those carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated atthe rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement and are allocated either to revenue or capital, as appropriate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 1158 Income and Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capitalgains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthe financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using thebalance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from theinitial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, andinterests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable thatthe temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent thatit is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or theasset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with inother comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
Assets are classified as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Group has classified short-term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.
46 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 SVG Capital plc Interim Report 2016 Financial information 2 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group and Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of profits and net assets at the end of the reporting period.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that have a material impact on net assets in future periods.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to net assets within the next financial year are discussed below.
Other areas of uncertainty and risk are discussed in note 26.
Assessment as an investment entity Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to measure their subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss rather than consolidate them, except for subsidiaries that are not an investment entity and that provide services that relate to the investment entitys investment activities.
The criteria which define an investment entity are, as follows: an entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services: an entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and an entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
SVG Capital plc is an international private equity investor listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Previously the Companys objective was achieving capital appreciation and investment income by investing in a portfolio of private equity and private equity related assets.
During the period, following the agreement to transfer the assets to HarbourVest, the Companys investment objective was amended to conduct an orderly realisation of its assets and to progressively return cash to investors.
The Company reports to its investors via quarterly investor information, and to its management, via internal management reports, on a fair value basis.
Substantially all investments are reported at fair value to the extent allowed by IFRS in the Funds annual and interim reports.
The Board has also concluded that the Company meets the additional characteristics of an investment entity, in that it has more than one investment: the investments are predominantly in the form of private equity and similar securities: it has more than one investor: and its investors are not related parties.
The Board has concluded that the Company meets the definition of an investment entity.
These conclusions will be reassessed on an annual basis, if any of these criteria or characteristics change.
Whilst the Company has been deemed an investment entity as detailed above, the wholly-owned subsidiary SVGCM acts as the investment manager of the Company and is not an investment entity itself, thus in line with IFRS 10 it has been consolidated into the Group financial statements.
All remaining subsidiaries in the Group have been measured at fair value through profit and loss.
Fair value of financial instruments The Group primarily invests in private equity limited partnerships Funds that in turn invest in companies that are typically unquoted.
Valuing unquoted investments involves a significant degree of judgement.
Fair values of the invested Funds is generally considered to be the Groups share of the net asset value of the Fund, as determined by the general partner GP of such funds, adjusted as considered necessary by the Board, and approved by the Board.
Further details of the valuation techniques and related analyses of sensitivities are given in note 13.
The Group values its investment portfolio in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines which is considered to be industry standard.
However, amounts ultimately realised on disposal of an investee company can differ materially from the previous carrying value and therefore have a significant impact on the Groups profits and net assets.
Assessment of fund investments as structured entities The Group has assessed whether the Funds in which it invests should be classified as structured entities.
The Group has considered the voting rights and other similar rights afforded to investors in these Funds, including the rights to remove the fund manager or liquidate the fund.
The Group has concluded on whether these rights are the dominant factor in controlling the Funds, or whether the contractual agreement with the fund manager is the dominant factor in controlling the Funds.
The Group has concluded that some of its fund investments are unconsolidated structured entities: further details can be found in note 12.

As the Group and Company invest primarily through partnership structures, excess management expenses relating to the private equity funds portfolio incurred by those partnerships are available to set off against any taxable income of the Group and Company.
These excess management expenses are not capitalised but unutilised expenses are carried forward to future periods.

Income distributions are taken directly to the income statement.
With the exception of a directly held unquoted investment valued at 17.2 million, all of the Groups portfolio investments held at 9 December 2016 were sold and transferred to HarbourVest subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The net gain on investments shown above of 112,677,000 included realised gains of 54,259,000 relating to assets disposed on in the period, while net gains of investments for the year ending 31 January 2016 of 83,757,000 includes realised gains of distributions of 146,433,000.
The gain of 72,928,000 shown in the Group and Company income statements for the prior period ending 31 January 2016 includes a fair value loss on associate during the period of 10,829,000.
The investment in associate was disposed in the year ending 31 January 2016.
Significant interests in investment funds Details of investments in which the Group or Company has an interest of 10% or more of any class of share units are detailed in the list of investments on page 6.
Unconsolidated structured entities The Group invests in several investment funds which meet the definition of unconsolidated structured entities in accordance with IFRS12.
The investment funds are closed ended private equity limited partnerships or investment companies which invest in underlying companies for the purposes of capital appreciation.
These entities are generally financed through committed capital from limited partners or shareholders, with cash being drawn down for financing investment activity.
As the investment portfolio has been sold to HarbourVest post period-end, any loss exposure has been mitigated.
However for disclosure purposes, based on the latest available information relating to these funds, the total size of the unconsolidated structured entities at 9 December 2016 is 3,056.8 million 31 January 2016: 5,785.9 million.
As at 9 December 2016, the Groups maximum exposure to loss attributable to these entities comprises the current carrying value ofthe assets, along with the uncalled committed capital relating to those investments, as summarised below: Carrying Value at 9 December 2016 Uncalled Maximum Assets Liabilities commitments loss exposure Balance sheet line item of asset 000 000 000 000 Investments designated as fair value through profit and loss 115,668 249,402 365,070 Carrying Value at 31 January 2016 Uncalled Maximum Assets Liabilities commitments loss exposure Balance sheet line item of asset 000 000 000 000 Investments designated as fair value through profit and loss 280,491 219,141 499,632 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 53 Financial information Notes to the accounts Continued 13 Fair values Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 13 requires disclosures relating to fair value measurement using a three-level fair value hierarchy.
The level within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
Thefollowing table shows financial instruments recognised at fair value, analysed between those whose fair value is based on: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : those involving inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices Level 2 : and those with inputs for the instrument that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3.

The Valuation Team of the Investment Manager perform a review of the valuations to identify and understand any significant changes to valuation inputs or techniques.
The valuations are then discussed with the Investment Team of the Investment Manager, to ensure valuation movements are in line with expectations based on the performance of the investment.
The Investment Teams expectations are established based on the results of their continuous investment monitoring process.
The Valuation and Investment Teams hold quarterly calls with the GPs of the Fund investments to discuss updates on the Fund investments performance, position and outlook and, where considered appropriate, hold further meetings to understand and challenge valuation inputs.
On a quarterly basis, after the checks above have been performed the Valuation Team presents the valuation results to the Board.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with fair value changes.
The valuations are reviewed and, if considered appropriate, approved by the Board.
Valuations consist of listed equities and unlisted managed funds.
Listed equities Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
When fair values of publicly traded equities are based on quoted market prices in an active market without any adjustments, the investments are included within Level 1 of the hierarchy.
Unlisted managed funds, equity co-investments and direct investments The Group primarily invests in private equity via limited partnerships or other fund structures.
Such vehicles are typically unquoted and in turn invest primarily in unquoted securities.
The Companys investment portfolio is recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines and IFRS.
Fair value is based on the Groups share of the Net Asset Value of the Fund, as determined by the GP of such funds.
Updated Net Asset Values are received for each fund on a quarterly basis.
The Net Asset Value of a fund is calculated after determining the fair value of a funds investment in any investee companies.
This value is generally obtained by calculating the Enterprise Value EV of the investee company and then deducting financial instruments, such as external debt, ranking ahead of the Funds highest ranking instrument in the entity.
The Groups participation in the remaining instruments is then calculated to assess the fair value of the Groups investment.
These valuations are then adjusted for material cash flows that have taken place between the date of the valuation as determined by the GP and the reporting date.
54 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 SVG Capital plc Interim Report 2016 Financial information 13 Fair values continued A common method of determining the EV is to apply a market-based multiple e. g. an average multiple based on a selection of comparable quoted companies to the maintainable earnings of the investee company.
This market-based approach presumes that the comparator companies are correctly valued by the market.
A discount is sometimes applied to market based multiples to adjust for points of difference between the comparators and the company being valued.
If the Valuation Team consider that an adjustment to the Net Asset Value is appropriate to better reflect fair value for market participants, the valuation is referred to the Pricing Committee of the Investment Manager.
The Pricing Committee reviews, and if considered appropriate, approves the Valuation Teams pricing adjustment recommendation.
Adjustments to net asset value may be considered, for example, where: there has been significant elapsed time between the Net Asset Value calculation date and the Groups balance sheet date: there has been material movements in quoted prices between the Net Asset Value calculation date and the Groups balance sheet date: the Group has agreed a sale of its holding in a fund interest at a price other than the Net Asset Value: valuations do not include a provision for carried interest: Net Asset Value is not derived from the fair value of underlying portfolio companies.
The Group has agreed the sale of its entire fund investments portfolio held at 9 December 2016 to HarbourVest and therefore the value at the period end has been adjusted to the selling price as per the asset transfer deed, which is deemed the recoverable amount.
The one remaining investment in the portfolio is the direct investment in WSI.
This is held at cost, which is deemed by management to be the recoverable amount.
Significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 valuations As described above, in arriving at the fair value of the unlisted managed funds, the key inputs are the net asset values as determined by the GP of the funds and any approved pricing adjustments recommended by the Valuation Team.
In prior periods, the approved pricing adjustments to the GP valuations relate to carried interest provisions.
Quoted companies within the managed funds portfolio were valued using quoted prices and foreign exchange rates as at the reporting date.
For unquoted investments, however, significant judgement was applied when calculating fair value.
The range of possible adjustments could be broad and would vary based on the circumstances driving the adjustment.
In the past, the Board has adjusted the valuation of unquoted companies by between 0% and 100% of the GPs proposed valuation.
In the current period however, as noted above, the Group had agreed the sale of its fund investment portfolio held at 9 December 2016 and therefore the current period end value had been adjusted to the agreed selling price.
This amount has been received subsequent to period end.
Level 3 reconciliation The following table shows a reconciliation of all movements in the fair value of the investment portfolio including investment in associates held and disposed in the year ended 31 January 2016 categorised within Level 3 between the beginning and the end of the reporting period: For the For the period ended year ended 9 December 31 January 2016 2016 Level 3 Level 3 Group and Company 000 000 Valuation of investment portfolio brought forward 752,114 1,084,058 Calls and purchases 155,500 93,640 Distributions and sales 726,975 466,708 Fair value gains and losses on investment portfolio 112,201 82,124 Disposal of investment in associates 41,000 Valuation carried forward 292,840 752,114 Derivative contracts During the current period, in order to hedge against the foreign exchange risk on interest receipts and principal redemption on some co-investments in debt securities, the Group entered into multiple forward currency agreements to effectively swap US dollars into sterling.
The exchange contracts were settled during the period at a cost of 8.7 million.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 55 Financial information Notes to the accounts Continued 13 Fair values continued Fair value of financial instruments not held at fair value The Groups debt instruments held during the period, such as the loan facility and convertible loan notes, were not held at fair value.
Indicative fair values of these instruments are shown below along with their carrying value in the balance sheet see note 18.
The fair value of the convertible loan notes as at 31 January 2016 is based on the offer price of the notes on that date.
Whilst this offer price is obtainable from the market, the instrument is considered illiquid and would therefore fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

14 Geographical analysis of investments The Groups fund investment portfolio as at 9 December 2016 is valued at its recoverable amount, deemed to be fair value, as it has agreed the sale of its entire fund investments portfolio to HarbourVest.
The direct investment in WSI is based in Europe.
Therefore an extensive geographical analysis of fund investment valuation is not deemed applicable for the current period.
As at the prior period reporting date of 31 January 2016, allocations were based on the expected geographical focus of the funds, as detailed in the table below.
A further analysis of the estimated currency exposure of assets is provided in note 26.

During the period, SVG North America Inc. and SVG Advisors Inc. were liquidated.
The remaining subsidiaries in the Group detailed in the table below as at 9 December 2016 have been written down to nil, which is considered to be the fair value, ahead of the anticipated liquidation of the Company and all its subsidiaries.

As at 9 December 2016, 0.3 million performance shares were still in issue it is expected that employees will exercise these options subsequent to the period end but prior to the anticipated liquidation of the company.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted under both plans is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The model incorporates six inputs, namely: share price on issue: exercise price: vesting period: risk-free interest rate: expected dividend yield: and expected volatility.
The expected lives of the options under both plans are based on historical data and are not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily bethe actual outcome.
No other features of options granted under either plan were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

The Group and Company diluted net asset value per share assumes that share options, performance shares and deferred shares note 20 with a strike price lower than the undiluted net asset value per share are exercised at the balance sheet date.
This would result in the issue of 279,509 ordinary shares 31 January 2016: 781,383 for consideration of nil 31 January 2016: nil.
The convertible loan notes 2016 were exercisable at a strike price of 640p, less than the undiluted net asset value per share, and were therefore dilutive at 31January 2016.
Assuming the conversion was exercised at the previous balance sheet date, this would have resulted in the issue of 6,109,375 ordinary shares and an increase in Group and Company net assets of 38,732,000 which was the carrying value of the convertible loan notes as at 31 January 2016.
The convertible loan notes were redeemed in full in June 2016 and are therefore not dilutive as at 9 December 2016.
Therefore, the calculation of the diluted net asset value per share is based on Group net assets attributable to equity shareholders of 1,124,703,000, Company net assets of 1,124,630,000 31 January 2016: 1,090,500,000 and 1,090,620,000, and on 156,366,159 31 January 2016:166,869,738 ordinary shares in issue at the period end.

64 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 SVG Capital plc Interim Report 2016 Financial information 26 Risk Financial instruments and risk profile SVG Capitals investment objective is to conduct an orderly realisation of its assets and to progressively return cash to shareholders.
This has been achieved as the large majority of the investment portfolio has been sold to HarbourVest post-period end.
The primary investment objective was changed during the period.
Previously the objective was to achieve capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of private equity and private equity-related assets.
These investments were typically illiquid.
In addition, the Group holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Group are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to this objective involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available fordividend.

Floating rate financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term deposits and AAA-rated money market funds.
Fixed rate financial assets include interest-bearing investments.
All financial assets are included at their recoverable amounts, and this carrying value is deemed to approximate fair value.
During the period ending 9 December 2016, the Group had cancelled its 300.0 million loan facility with Lloyds Bank plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and State Street Bank and Trust Company, which was undrawn throughout the current and prior periods.
The Group repaid its subordinated convertible loan notes in June 2016.
The Group was unlevered at the balance sheet date.
The Group also has uncalled fund commitments note 19 as at 9 December 2016 of 338.9 million 31 January 2016: 331.9 million, which are discussed below as part of borrowing and funding risks.
It should also be noted that fund investments and underlying investee companies may also utilise borrowings to varying degrees.
This isparticularly the case with respect to CLO funds and structured private equity funds of funds, which are highly leveraged vehicles.

These commitments have been transferred to HarbourVest as part of the agreed portfolio sales subsequent to the balance sheet date.
For the purposes of the maturity analysis it has been assumed that all financial assets will be realised at their carrying value, which is primarily based on the agreed disposal proceeds of the portfolio transfers to HarbourVest.
The amounts receivable within three months are based on expected cash flows.
During the period ended 9 December 2016, the Groups 300.0 million loan facility was cancelled and the convertible loan notes were repaid.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash flow forecasts and available funding options.
Valuation market price risk As at 9 December 2016, the Groups exposure to valuation risk is mitigated by the agreed sale of its portfolio interests to HarbourVest.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies, all underlying investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the current IPEV Valuation Guidelines and IFRS 13.
The IPEV Valuation Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments and involves exercising judgement.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Group, it benefited from fair value gains on its investment portfolio of 140.0 million during the period 31 January 2016: gains of 83.8 million.
However, as previously reported the disposal price for the majority of the Groups portfolio investments has been agreed.
In the prior period, the Groups sensitivity to valuation risk was affected by changes in the Groups levels of borrowing and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
It was also affected by leverage in the underlying companies in which we invest in and the local currency denomination of such investments.
At 9 December 2016, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss would result in a 2.6% 31 January 2016: 7.3% change in Shareholders funds.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Group may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In the majority of the funds in which the Group will invest, the GP, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by the board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
GP consents have been received for the asset transfers agreed with HarbourVest and the transfers have now been successfully executed.
Concentration risk The Groups portfolio has previously been fairly concentrated but this no longer represents a risk as most of it has now been realised for cash, subsequent to the balance sheet date.
As at the prior period reporting date of 31 January 2016, the value of the 15 largest core underlying investee holdings represented 66.9% of the core portfolio.
Interest rate risk The Groups revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since a portion of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest see note 4.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments held at 9 December 2016 has minimal impact on the Groups financial position as the sale price has been agreed with HarbourVest and the transfers have now been executed.
Previously, the Groups primary objective was to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate risk was indirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it was not possible to quantify such effects.
Interest rates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specific level, interest rates and credit spreads also have an important role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly financed by debt.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately.
At 9 December 2016, the Group held investments in AAA-rated money market funds valued at 308.0 million 31 January 2016: 311.6 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds are redeemable on less than 24hours notice.
Based on the money market funds held at 9 December 2016 and the interest rates as at that date, a 0.25% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would generate additional annual interest income of 770,000 and similarly a decrease in interest rates of 0.25% would lead to a reduction in annual interest income of 770,000.
Other floating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
Based on the bank balances held at 9 December 2016 and interest rates as at that date, a 0.25% increase or decrease in interest rates of 0.25% would have minimal impact on annual interest income as the current interest earnings are negligible.
At 9 December 2016, the Group had repaid it convertible loan notes 31 January 2016: 38.7 million.
Interest rate risk on the Bonds was mitigated in prior period as they paid a fixed coupon.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 67 Financial information Notes to the accounts Continued 26 Risk continued Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group unless otherwise disclosed.
The Group is subject to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties.
Cash equivalents at the balance sheet date comprised money market funds with a variety of counterparties, each fund having a credit rating of AAA.
As at 9 December 2016, there was a receivable amounting to 523.2 million, representing the consideration due from HarbourVest for the first tranche of assets transferred in the period.
HarbourVest were bound by the signed asset transfer deed and the amount was received in full subsequent to the period end.
Currency risk The Group has historically been exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities were denominated in foreign currency andtheir sterling value could be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
However, foreign exchange rate changes currently have a minimal impact on the Groups investments as the sale price has been agreed with HarbourVest and the transfers of the portfolio have been executed subsequent to the period end.
Only one remaining investment is now held, and this is denominated and valued in sterling.
In addition, cash and cash equivalents are currently almost entirely denominated in sterling.
Given the minimal impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Groups position as at 9 December 2016, hypothetical increases or decreases are deemed insignificant to the Groups results.
For the year ending 31 January 2016, a hypothetical 10% value depreciation of sterling would have a 7.6% on Shareholders funds, and a hypothetical 10% value appreciation of sterling would have a -6.2% on Shareholders funds.
Capital risk management SVG Capitals investment objective is toconduct an orderly realisation of its assets and to progressively return cash to shareholders.
Cash flow forecasts are reviewed in depth which allows management to plan for liabilities and the overall liquidation of the Company.
General risks associated with investment in private equity Investment in private equity involves a high degree of risk.
The Group invests in private equity through its exposure to private equity funds and co-investments.
Such investments are illiquid and as such may be difficult to realise, although this is no longer of significance as the asset transfers to HarbourVest have now been executed.
Default risk This is no longer relevant as the asset transfers to HarbourVest have now been executed.
Investment holding period risk This is not as relevant compared to prior periods as the asset transfers to HarbourVest have now been executed.
Investment in private equity requires a long-term commitment with no certainty of return.
Most of the investments made by the Group are illiquid holdings in private equity funds and, in some cases, may not be capable of being realised in a timely manner or at all, dependent on prevailing market conditions.
The timing of cash distributions, if any, made by the private equity funds is uncertain and unpredictable.
Prevailing market conditions may significantly influence a GPs ability to achieve exits.
Subdued market conditions may result in GPs delaying the sale of portfolio companies until conditions improve.
Moreover, certain exit routes may be more challenged in these conditions, such as the IPO route.
A GPs ability to realise its interest in certain portfolio companies in whole or in part may be subject to contractual restrictions such as shareholder lock-up arrangements.
It may therefore be the case that the Group decides to pay calls with debt finance rather than relying upon receiving distributions from investments which it has made which may therefore increase the Groups borrowings and, in turn, risk and volatility for shareholders.
Disposals of a fund interest could have a long lead time since there is only a limited market for secondary sales of private equity investments.
Further, sales or other transfers of interests in private equity funds sometimes require the written consent of the GP of the fund, the granting of which is at its discretion.
Accordingly, the Group may not be able to sell its investments in private equity funds at their net asset value.
The Groups portfolio is fairly concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers as explained previously and this may impact the ability to place a large holding of a single fund on the secondary market at any one time.
These factors relating to investment holding contribute to the overall liquidity and funding risks faced by the Group, which the Board manages by regularly and reviewing cash flow forecasts and the funding options available.
68 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 SVG Capital plc Interim Report 2016 Financial information 26 Risk continued Portfolio company risks This is no longer of significance as the asset transfers to HarbourVest have now been executed.
In prior periods, portfolio company risks were relatively important, since the Group invests through private equity funds in portfolio companies, and thus the risks experienced by the portfolio companies will closely affect the returns earned by the Group and the trading price and value of its ordinary shares.
The risks which the portfolio companies may experience, and the risks posed by an investment in such companies, include: these companies may be highly leveraged and subject to significant debt service obligations, stringent operating and financial covenants and a higher risk of default under financing and other contractual arrangements, which would lead to severe adverse consequences for the relevant portfolio company and the value of the Groups investment in such company if a default were to occur: the valuations of highly leveraged companies are typically more sensitive to changes in value in public company comparable earnings multiples, declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.
The risk of loss associated with a highly leveraged company is generally far greater than for companies with comparatively less debt: they may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt facilities, or to refinance debt facilities when they fall due, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities in which the Group is ultimately invested: they may require significant additional capital investment or operational or management support to improve their operations, finance expansions or maintain their competitive positions.
Such investment and support may not be forthcoming: often, little public information exists about these companies and investors in these companies generally must rely on information obtained by the GP, or other manager, of the relevant fund which holds the portfolio company: reliance is placed on the GP as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during any due diligence exercise conducted prior to an investment being made.
The GP, or relevant manager, of the fund in question may have made judgements concerning the materiality of contingent or actual risks or liabilities identified during due diligence that may not in practice turn out to have been accurate: general operating risks arising from or being, amongst other matters, the cost of goods and services, difficulty in obtaining customers, losses arising from customer failure, market developments, competition risk, key man risk, foreign exchange risk, financing risks, an increase in costs and the legal and regulatory framework within which the portfolio company operates: there are likely to be prior claims on the assets of portfolio companies from debt providers which would reduce the amounts earned by the equity holders including, indirectly, the Group: and lenders to portfolio companies may take actions which are adverse to the interests of the holders of equity interests in the portfolio company including, indirectly, the Group.
The value of the portfolio companies held by the funds in which the Group holds interests may be affected by uncertainties, such as political developments, changes in government policies, regulations, laws, taxation, currency fluctuations, currency repatriation and other restrictions, in some of the countries in which the funds may invest.
The Group, directly or indirectly through the funds in which the Group holds interests, may also be exposed to these risks.
Passive investor with limited recourse This is no longer relevant as the asset transfers to HarbourVest have already been executed subsequent to the period end date.
In prior periods, it was considered that the Group is generally a passive investor and has limited powers under the governing documents of the funds in which it holds interests.
The funds concerned are, within certain broad parameters, generally authorised to follow broad investment guidelines and, subject thereto, are able to invest in geographies, industries and investment opportunities at their discretion.
The Group does not review each proposed investment and is, subject to certain limited exceptions, unable to refuse to meet a call without suffering the consequences of a default.
There can be no assurance that the strategies adopted by GPs or managers of the funds in which the Group holds interests will be successful or that the portfolio companies of such funds, or the Groups investments generally, will appreciate in value.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 69 Financial information Notes to the accounts Continued 26 Risk continued Regulatory risks The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is increasingly complex and the Group faces a number of regulatory risks.
Breaches of regulations such as the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and damage theGroups reputation.
Breaches of controls by service providers could also lead to reputational damage or loss.
Key regulatory risks havebeen identified and appropriate monitoring of such risks is undertaken regularly on behalf of the Board.
SVGCM, the investment manager and a Group subsidiary, was authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority during the period.
Taxation risk Any change in the taxation legislation or practice could affect the value of the Groups investments and as a result, its performance.
Abreach of Section 1158 of the United Kingdom Corporation Tax Act 2010 could result in the Group or Company being subject to corporation tax on realised gains on the sale of portfolio investments which would have a material adverse effect on the net returns earned by SVG Capital.
The Company has complied with Section 1158 during the current accounting period but there is a risk that it could be deemed non-compliant during the subsequent wind-down process.
However, the Group has significant tax losses available to mitigate against the impact of a loss of investment trust status.
