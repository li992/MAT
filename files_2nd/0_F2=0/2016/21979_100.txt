Derivatives continued Otherderivatives The companys policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
