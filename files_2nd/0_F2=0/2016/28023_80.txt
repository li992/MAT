CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Guarantees: Borrowing facilities of subsidiary undertakings 421.1 386.6 Performance bonds 159.7 169.8 159.7 169.8 Other 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 163.7 173.8 584.8 560.4 Guarantees in respect of performance bonds are entered into in the normal course of business.
No liability is expected to arise in respect of the guarantees.
Other contingent liabilities relate to a possible obligation to pay further consideration in respect of a previously acquired business when the outcome of planning applications is known.
In connection with the application of the audit exemption under Section 479A of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has guaranteed all the outstanding liabilities as at 31 March 2016 of certain of its subsidiaries: Peninsula Leasing Limited, Pennon Power Limited, Exe Continental and Viridor Waste 2 Limited since these companies qualify for the exemption.
The Group is subject to litigation from time to time as a result of its activities.
The Group establishes provisions in connection with litigation where it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Significant management judgement is required to estimate the tax provisions relating to uncertain tax items that remain to be agreed with HMRC.
It is reasonably possible that the outcomes and settlements may differ from the estimated current tax liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible that at a future date, on conclusion of the open matters, the final outcome may vary significantly.
Whilst a range of outcomes is reasonably possible, the extent of the range is additional liabilities of up to 20 million to a reduction in liabilities of up to 52 million.
Any such variations will affect the tax financial results in the year in which such a determination is made.
In addition to provisions established for uncertain items, the Group has paid in full the tax HMRC interpret as due, and therefore would benefit by up to 70 million should such tax positions be concluded in the Groups favour.
