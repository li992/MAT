Revenue in Air Handling, which is the largest pure-play specialist air handling distributor in Europe, grew by 66.0% as it benefited from good LFL growth of 8.5%, acquisitions and foreign exchange movements.
The air handling market continues to grow at a faster rate than the wider construction sector due to strong demand drivers including higher energy efficiency and air quality standards.
Gross margin also improved as the business grew its higher value whole system solution, which encompasses design to supply.

Basis of preparation The Groups financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and on a basis consistent with that adopted in the previous year.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments which are stated at their fair value.
Whilst the financial information included in this Preliminary Results Announcement has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of IFRS, this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS.
The Preliminary Results Announcement does not constitute the Companys statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006 but is derived from those statutory accounts.
The Group's statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies, and those for 2016 will be delivered following the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The Auditor has reported on the statutory accounts for 2016 and 2015, and their reports, which included no matters to which the Auditor drew attention by way of emphasis, were unqualified and did not contain statements under Sections 498 2 or 498 3 of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the financial statements.
The following standards were amended in the current period: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle Annual improvements 2012-2014 cycle Disclosure Initiative amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Adoption of the above standards has not had a material impact on the Accounts of the Group.
In March 2016, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued an agenda decision which clarified the circumstances in which certain Balance Sheet items can be offset in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
It was determined that where a Group does not expect to settle subsidiaries bank balances on a net basis, these balances cannot be offset.
In response to this, the Group has reviewed its cash pooling arrangements which has resulted in changes to the amounts that can be offset.
Comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2015 has been restated.
The impact of this change on 2015 is to increase both cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet by 57.2m.
In addition, the Group has also reviewed the presentation of its supplier rebates receivable: in particular supplier rebates where there is no right to offset against trade payable balances.
As a result comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2015 has been restated.
The impact of this change is an increase in respect of both prepayments and accrued income and trade payables of 53.2m.
There was no overall impact on net debt or net assets from either restatement.
At the date of authorisation of this financial information, there are a number of new standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective some of which are pending endorsement by the EU, which the Group has not applied in this financial information.
These are detailed in the Groups Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016.

There is no material difference between the basis of preparation of the information reported above and the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Income tax The income tax expense comprises: 2016 2015 m m Current tax UK corporation tax: - on losses profits for the year 0.1 - - adjustments in respect of previous years - - 0.1 - Overseas tax: - on losses profits for the year 11.4 10.8 - adjustments in respect of previous years 0.6 0.4 Total current tax 10.9 10.4 Deferred tax Current year 1.8 5.7 Adjustments in respect of previous years 0.3 1.0 Deferred tax charge in respect of pension schemes 0.2 0.2 0.3 Effect of change in rate 0.3 Total deferred tax 1.4 4.6 Total income tax expense 12.3 15.0 Includes a charge of 0.1m 2015: credit of 0.5m in respect of the change in rate.
Income tax continued The total tax charge for the year differs from that resulting from applying the standard rate of corporate tax in the UK at 31 December 2016 of 20.0% 31 December 2015: 20.0%.
Due to the effect of Other items presented of the Consolidated Income Statement and their impact on a Group blend rate of tax, the reconciliation of total income tax expenses has been presented against the UK standard rate of tax, reflecting the tax residency of SIG plc.
The differences are explained in the following reconciliation: 2016 2015 m % m % Loss profit on ordinary activities before tax 106.3 51.3 21.3 20.0 Tax at 20.0% 2015: 20.0% thereon 10.3 20.0 Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: non-deductible and non-taxable items 3.4 3.2 4.8 9.4 impairment charges 25.6 24.1 - - losses arising in the year not recognised for deferred tax purposes 1.4 1.3 - - losses utilised not previously recognised - - 0.3 0.6 other adjustments in respect of previous years 1.1 1.0 1.4 2.7 effect of overseas tax rates 4.5 4.2 2.4 4.7 effect of change in rate on deferred tax 0.2 0.2 0.8 1.6 Total income tax expense 12.3 11.6 15.0 29.2 The effective tax rate for the Group on the total loss before tax of 106.3m is negative 11.6% 2015: positive 29.2%.
The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before Other items of 77.5m is 25.2% 2015: 24.2%, which comprises a tax charge of 25.9% 2015: 25.0% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 0.7% 2015: 0.8% in respect of prior years.
The current tax charge in the UK is minimal due to the use of 20.4m of brought forward non-trade tax losses.
There is a corresponding tax charge within the current year deferred tax movement relating to the utilisation of these losses.
The factors that will affect the Group's future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium the Netherlands corporate tax rates greater than the rate in the UK and Ireland Poland corporate tax rates less than the rate in the UK.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: the agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with a corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with the exception of deferred tax on share options which has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

Acquisitions During the period the Group acquired the following: % of ordinary share Acquisition Country of Acquisition name Principal activity capital acquired date incorporation Manufacturer and supplier of facade Metall Architektur Limited 100% 5 January 2016 United Kingdom panel systems Profant Lufttechnik Developer and fabricator of specialist 100% 11 January 2016 Austria HandelsgmbH air handling systems Manufacturer and supplier of metal Maury SAS 100% 20 January 2016 France roofing and facades Designer and manufacturer of offsite Metechno Limited 100% 1 March 2016 United Kingdom products SAS Direct & Partitioning Distributor of partitioning systems and 100% 5 March 2016 United Kingdom Limited associated products BLH - Bauelemente fr Fabricator and distributor of specialist Lftungstechnik Hennen 100% 4 July 2016 Germany air handling systems GmbH Includes acquisition of the trade and certain assets of KME Yorkshire Limited.
The provisional fair value of the net assets of these businesses at acquisition in aggregation were as follows: m Property, plant and equipment 2.0 3.2 Inventories Trade and other receivables 6.4 Cash acquired 1.1 Debt acquired 1.6 Trade and other payables 5.5 Net corporation tax and deferred tax liability 0.3 Net assets acquired 5.3 Intangible assets customer relationships 6.8 Intangible assets non-compete clauses 0.1 1.5 Deferred tax liability on acquired intangible assets Goodwill 10.8 Total consideration 21.5 Consideration is represented by: Cash 21.1 Contingent consideration 0.4 Total consideration 21.5 Cash per above 21.1 Cash acquired 1.1 Settlement of loan notes and contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions 5.3 Settlement of amounts payable for purchase of businesses 25.3 In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, acquisition expenses of 0.8m in relation to the above acquisitions have been recognised within the Consolidated Income Statement and have been presented within Other items.
Dependent upon future profits, a further 15.5m may be paid to the vendors of recent acquisitions who are employed by the Group.
These payments are contingent upon the vendors remaining within the business and, as required by IFRS 3, this will be treated as remuneration and will be charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as earned.
The related accrual of potential consideration in the year to 31 December 2016 is a credit of 0.3m 31 December 2015: charge of 10.2m.
Added to the 0.8m acquisition expenses is a 5.1m net decrease in contingent consideration based solely on a reassessment of post-acquisition performance of the acquired businesses: this has led to a net credit within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement of 4.6m in respect of acquisitions.
In addition, 0.5m of deferred and contingent consideration not subject to the vendors remaining within the business has been recognised within goodwill and intangible assets in the year.
The Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2017.
These fair value adjustments may relate primarily to: a the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their fair value: b the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group: and c an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Group's policies.
The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of 6.0m and a gross contractual value of 6.1m.
The best estimate at the date of acquisition of the contractual cash flows not able to be collected is 0.1m.
Acquisitions continued Included within goodwill is the benefit of staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
The goodwill of 10.8m arising from the acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Post-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 for all 2016 acquisitions amounted to 34.8m and 1.3m respectively.
The Directors estimate that the combined pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2016 acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2016 to the acquisition dates was 4.9m and 0.3m respectively.
Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and have therefore not been disclosed.
SIG has a shareholding of less than 0.1% in a German purchasing co-operative.
Net purchases from this co-operative on commercial terms totalled 284m in 2016 2015: 251m.
At the balance sheet date net trade payables in respect of the co-operative amounted to 12m 2015: 1m.

Viability Statement In accordance with the requirements of the 2014 amendments to the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code, the Directors confirm that they have performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Board has determined that a three year period to 31 December 2019 is the most appropriate time period for its viability review.
This period has been selected since it gives the Board sufficient visibility into the future, due to industry characteristics and business cycle, to make a realistic viability assessment.
As part of the Groups strategic planning process a three year business model was produced covering the period to 31 December 2019.
In order to assess the resilience of the Group to threats to its viability posed by those risks in severe but plausible scenarios, this model was subjected to thorough multi-variant stress and sensitivity analysis together with an assessment of potential mitigating actions.
This multi-variant stress and sensitivity analysis included scenarios arising from combinations of the following: the implications of both a challenging economic environment and a growing market on the Groups revenues both pricing and volume impacts : the impact of the competitive environment within which the Groups businesses operate and the interaction with the Groups gross margin: global inflation and the impact on the Groups operating cost base: working capital requirements from investment and trading activities, taking into account normal seasonality trends and short term working capital management: and timing, delivery and efficiency of the Groups strategic growth priorities.
The resulting impact on key metrics, such as debt headroom and covenants, was considered.
After conducting their viability review, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment to 31 December 2019.
Going concern basis In determining whether the Groups 2016 financial information can be prepared on a going concern basis, the Directors considered all factors likely to affect the Groups future development, performance and its financial position, including cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and the risks and uncertainties relating to its business activities.
The key factors considered by the Directors were as follows: the implications of the challenging economic environment and the continuing weak levels of market demand in the building and construction markets on the Groups revenues and profits projections of working capital requirements taking into account normal seasonality trends and short term working capital management: the impact of the competitive environment within which the Groups businesses operate: the availability and market prices of the goods that the Group sells: the credit risk associated with the Groups trade receivable balances: the potential actions that could be taken in the event that revenues are worse than expected, to ensure that operating profit and cash flows are protected: and the committed finance facilities available to the Group.
Having considered all the factors above, including downside sensitivities, the Directors are satisfied that the Group will be able to operate within the terms and conditions of the Groups financing facilities, and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups 2016 financial information.
Principal risks and uncertainties Risk management involves the identification and evaluation of risks and is the responsibility of the Group Board.
The Groups ability to manage risk is continually improving through the focus on risk management capability to ensure that it remains robust and that emerging risks are identified, assessed and managed effectively.
The risk management process incorporates both top-down and bottom-up elements to the identification, evaluation and management of risks, and all risks evaluated are referenced to the achievement of the Groups Strategic Initiatives.
Risks are continually evaluated using consistent measurement criteria.
Mitigating controls are identified and opportunities for the enhancement of the Groups control environment are implemented.
Principal risks and uncertainties continued Throughout the year the risks that SIG faces have been critically reviewed and evaluated.
The assessment of the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact SIGs long-term performance are outlined below.
These risks are not set out in order of priority and they do not comprise all the risks and the uncertainties that SIG faces.
This list has the potential to change as some risks assume greater importance than others during the course of the year.
Risk Key mitigation activities Include: Market conditions Maintain a broad spread of markets, products and customers to limit risks and act as a natural hedge within any given territory.

Government policy and expenditure plans, private investor decisions, the general economic climate Continual review of all available indicators of market activity and regular communication with key and both business and to a lesser extent consumer confidence are all factors which can influence suppliers and customers to ensure that any change in market demand is anticipated as early as the level of building activity and therefore the demand for many of the Groups products.
Ensure the Group remains structured in a way that enables it to take prompt action in the event of a material change in the trading environment.
Ensure the Group maintains a strong balance sheet and financial position.
Competitors and margin management Strong trading presence and positions in the majority of the markets in which the Group trades.
