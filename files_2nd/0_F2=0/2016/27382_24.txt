For dividends payable see Note 8.
Other financial liabilities include interest rate swaps carried at fair value Note 19 and, in the prior year, amounts payable under the Companys closed season buyback arrangements for the Companys own shares Note 19 which subsequently expired unfulfilled.
Share Capital, ESOT and Other Reserves Details of the Companys share capital and share buybacks are given in Note 23.
ESOT transactions are detailed in Note 26.
Other reserves in the Company balance sheet of 985.2m 2015: 985.2m represent the difference between the market price and the nominal value of shares issued as part of the capital reconstruction in 2002 on acquisition of NEXT Group plc which was subject to section 131 Companies Act 1985 merger relief.
Profit and Loss Account and Distributable Reserves The profit and loss account of the Parent Company does not include any unrealised profits, however the amount available for distribution under the Companies Act 2006 by reference to these accounts is effectively reduced by the ESOT reserve of 208.7m.
At January 2016, therefore, the amount available for distribution by reference to these accounts is 433.1m.
The Group also has substantial retained profits in its subsidiary companies which are expected to flow up to the Parent Company in due course, such that surplus cash generated can continue to be returned to our external shareholders.
During the year to January 2016, the directors became aware that certain dividends paid in 2014 and 2015 were made otherwise than in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 because interim accounts had not been filed at Companies House prior to payment.
At a General Meeting of the Companys shareholders held on 10 February 2016, a resolution was passed which authorised the appropriation of distributable profits to the payment of the relevant dividends and removed any right for the Company to pursue shareholders or directors for repayment.
The overall effect of this resolution being passed was to return all parties to the position they would have been in had the relevant dividends been made in full compliance with the Companies Act 2006.
