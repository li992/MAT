Post employment benefits We operate a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees.
The Groups largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK.
For further details see Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in note 1 Basis of preparation to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position.
Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date.
Assets are valued at market value.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, is also taken to other comprehensive income.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements.
The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Groups share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised in the statement of financial position.
The Group contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Background At 31 March 2016 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The Groups pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.
Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK and the United States.
Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Australia, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, SouthAfrica, Spain and the UK.

Post employment benefits continued Defined benefit schemes The Groups main defined benefit scheme is in the UK, being the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme Vodafone UK plan.
There are two segregated sections of the Vodafone UK plan, the pre-existing assets and liabilities of the Vodafone UK plan in the Vodafone Section and the former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CWWRP assets and liabilities, which were transferred into the Vodafone UK plan on 6 June 2014, in the CWW Section, with the CWWRP then being wound up.
The pre-existing Vodafone UK plan and the former CWWRP plan closed to future accrual on 31 March 2010 and 30 November 2013 respectively.
Until 30 November 2013 the CWWRP allowed employees to accrue a pension at a rate of 1 85th of their final salary for each year of service until the retirement age of 60 with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary.
Employees contributed 5% of their salary into the scheme.
The defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee Boards that are legally separated from the Group.
The Trustee Board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company.
The Boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and the governance of the fund.
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of members, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the plans.
The UK pensions environment is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives are set out in legislation and include promoting and improving understanding of the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits and regulating occupational defined benefit and contribution schemes.
The Pensions Regulator is a non-departmental public body established under the Pensions Act 2004 and sponsored by the Department for Work And Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory framework set by the UK Parliament.
The Pensions Regulators statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website at thepensionsregulator.
The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation and oversight from the Pensions Regulator.
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years.
Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.
Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.
The publication by the International Accounting Standards Board in June 2015 of its Exposure Draft of amendments to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, has provided additional clarity on the role of trustees rights in an assessment of the recoverability of a surplus in an employee pension fund.
The trustees of the Vodafone UK plan have neither a unilateral right to wind up the plan and purchase annuities nor a unilateral right to improve members benefits and consequently the Exposure Draft as currently proposed is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups results.
The most recent valuations for the Vodafone and CWWRP sections of the Vodafone UK plan were carried out as at 31 March 2013 by independent actuaries appointed by the plan trustees.
These valuations revealed a total deficit of 437 million on the schemes funding basis.
Following the valuation, the Group paid special one-off contributions totalling 365 million in April 2014 325 million into the Vodafone Section and 40 million into the CWW Section.
These lump sum contributions represented accelerated funding amounts that would otherwise have been due over the period to 31 March 2020.
No further contributions were therefore due to the Vodafone UK plan for the period to 31 March 2016.
The next valuation, which is being performed as at 31 March 2016, will be completed during the 2017 financial year after which the position of the scheme will be reassessed.
Funding plans are individually agreed for each of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes with the respective trustees, taking into account local regulatory requirements.
It is expected that ordinary contributions relating to future service of 39 million will be paid into the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during the year ending 31 March 2017.
The main UK defined benefit scheme will be carrying out a Pension Increase Exchange PIE exercise between May and August 2016.
All eligible pensioners will be given the opportunity to exchange future increases on part or all of their pension and receive a higher pension immediately.
If they accept the offer after taking financial advice, they will no longer receive future increases on that part of their pension.
It is expected that this exercise will reduce the future liabilities of the scheme which will be reflected in next years accounts The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan: further details are provided in note 30 Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements.
Actuarial assumptions The Groups scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below: 2016 2015 2014 % % % 1 Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March : 2 Rate of inflation 2.8 3.0 3.2 Rate of increase in salaries 2.6 2.8 3.1 Discount rate 3.2 3.0 4.2 Notes: 1 Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual schemes.
2 The rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred payment is the rate of inflation.
Mortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual scheme actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the Group where appropriate.
The Groups largest scheme is the Vodafone UK plan.
Further life expectancies assumed for the UK schemes are 24.0 25.3 years 2015: 24.5 25.8 years: 2014: 23.3 24.7 years for a male female pensioner currently aged 65 and 26.6 28.1 years 2015: 27.1 28.7years: 2014: 25.9 27.5 years from age 65 for a male female non-pensioner member currently aged 40.

3 Pension assets are deemed to be recoverable and there are no adjustments in respect of minimum funding requirements as future economic benefits are available to the Company either in the form of future refunds or, for plans still open to benefit accrual, in the form of possible reductions in future contributions.
Duration of the benefit obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2016 is 22.3 years 2015: 22.7 years: 2014: 21.7 years.
Fair value of pension assets 2016 2015 m m Cash and cash equivalents 87 97 Equity investments: With quoted prices in an active market 1,487 1,489 Without quoted prices in an active market 157 154 Debt instruments: With quoted prices in an active market 2,747 2,567 Property: With quoted prices in an active market 8 7 Without quoted prices in an active market 15 12 1 Derivatives: With quoted prices in an active market 292 99 Without quoted prices in an active market Investment fund 231 Annuity policies Without quoted prices in an active market 485 531 Total 4,925 4,956 Note: 1 Derivatives include collateral held in the form of cash.
The schemes have no direct investments in the Groups equity securities or in property currently used by the Group.
Each of the plans manages risks through a variety of methods and strategies including equity protection, to limit downside risk in falls in equity markets, inflation and interest rate hedging and, in the CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, a substantial insured pensioner buy-in policy.
The actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2016 was a loss of 2 million 2015: 897 million return.
Sensitivity analysis Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2016.
Rate of inflation Rate of increase in salaries Discount rate Life expectancy Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 0.5% Increase by 1 year Decrease by 1 year m m m m m m m m Decrease increase in present value of defined obligation 395 448 4 4 597 511 126 126 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
