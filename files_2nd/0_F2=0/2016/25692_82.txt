In addition, a revenue share agreement was entered into by Johnson Matthey Plc.
This agreement and the requirement for unanimous board decisions ensure that the group has a significant influence in CECC and so it is accounted for as an investment in associate.
In the parent company, the revenue share agreement is accounted for as a non-current available-for-sale investment.

There is no active market for the unquoted investments since they are investments in a company that is in the start up phase and in investment vehicles that invest in start up companies and are categorised as level 3 note 27.
The investment vehicles now hold some investments in quoted companies and so the fair value technique has now changed from cost to being based on the percentage ownership of the value of the underlying assets.
Movements in the unquoted investments in the year are shown below but, given their size, it would be overly onerous to provide additional detail.
