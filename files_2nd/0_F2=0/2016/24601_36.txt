Hays plc | 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements 104 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 4.
Segmental information IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
Net fees and operating profit from continuing operations The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports, rather than use turnover.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in its internal management reporting.
The full detail of these items can be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 96.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 5.
