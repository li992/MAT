This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
There are no customers that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 7.1m FY15: 6.3m which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided for as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 30 days FY15: 28 days.
Trade debtors to be received from customers relating to instalments of policy premiums that are not yet due have been excluded from the average age calculation.
