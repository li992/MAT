North America 12.9 2.3 12.2 2.3 Latin America 17.0 4.7 17.6 4.7 UK and Ireland 9.5 2.3 9.3 2.3 EMEA 13.0 3.5 12.3 3.1 Asia Pacific 12.2 5.3 13.0 5.3 As indicated in note 5 a, value-in-use calculations are underpinned by financial budgets, looking forward up to five years.
Managements key assumptions in setting the financial budgets for the initial five-year period were as follows: forecast revenue growth rates were based on past experience, adjusted for the strategic opportunities within each CGU: the forecasts typically used average nominal growth rates between 3% and 9%, with Asia Pacific in the range of 8% to 20%: EBIT was forecast based on historic margins, which were expected to be broadly stable throughout the period in the mature CGUs, and improving to a low double-digit margin in EMEA and Asia Pacific: and forecast operating cash flow conversion rates were based on historic experience and performance expectations in a range of 90% to 100%.
Further details of the principles used in determining the basis of allocation by CGU and annual impairment testing are given in note 5 a. d Results of annual impairment review as at 31 March 2016 The review for the EMEA CGU indicated that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value by US$50m and that any decline in estimated value-in-use in excess of that amount would result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
The sensitivities, which result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value, can be summarised as follows: an absolute increase of 1.7 percentage points in the WACC, from 13.0% to 14.7%: or an absolute reduction of 2.5 percentage points in the long-term growth rate, from 3.5% to 1.0%: or a reduction of 2.6 percentage points in the forecast terminal profit margin.
This is forecast to improve to a low double-digit margin in the terminal period but is below managements expectations for a mature CGU.
A reduction in the annual margin improvement of approximately 0.5 percentage points per year over the five-year forecast period would also reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying value.
The Asia Pacific review confirmed that the recoverable amount of that CGU exceeded its carrying value by US$146m and that any decline in estimated value-in-use in excess of that amount would result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
The only sensitivity, which results in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value, is a reduction of 5.9 percentage points in the forecast terminal profit margin.
A reduction in the annual margin improvement of approximately 1.2 percentage points per year over the five-year forecast period would also reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the other CGUs significantly exceeded their carrying value on the basis of the assumptions set out in the table in note 19 c and any reasonably possible changes thereof.
