For the purposes of the disclosures in the loan asset credit quality section below: A loan is considered past due when the borrower has failed to make a payment when due under the terms of the loan contract.
The impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those subject to collective impairment.
Loans neither past due nor impaired and loans that are past due but not impaired consist predominantly of corporate and retail loans that are performing and whilst not individually impaired, may be subject to a collective impairment allowance.
Impaired loans that are individually assessed consist predominantly of corporate loans that are past due and for which an individual allowance has been raised.
Portfolio impaired loans, which are not included in the categories above are a subset of collectively impaired loans and consist predominantly of retail loans that are 90 days or more past due.
