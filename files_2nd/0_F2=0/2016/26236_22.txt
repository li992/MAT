192 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional financial information continued 34 Tax The tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values.
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.
Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders The total tax expense shown in the groups Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and shareholders.
This has been apportioned between that attributable to policyholders returns and equity holders profits.
This represents the fact that the groups long term business in the UK pays tax on policyholder investment return, in addition to the corporation tax charge charged on shareholder profit.
The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the group pays on the profits that it makes.
For this apportionment, the equity holders tax on long term business is estimated by applying the statutory tax rate to profits attributed to equity holders.
This is considered to approximate the corporation tax attributable to shareholders as calculated under UK tax rules.
The balance of income tax associated with UK long term business is attributed to income tax attributable to policyholders returns and approximates the corporation tax attributable to policyholders as calculated under UK tax rules.
Use of estimates Tax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
For tax this includes the determination of liabilities recoverables for uncertain tax positions and estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.
Tax rates The table below provides a summary of the standard corporate income tax rates for the year, affecting the groups current and deferred tax charges or credits.
R eductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020 have been enacted in UK law.
Enacted rates between 20% and 17% have been applied to UK temporary differences to calculate UK deferred assets and liabilities on the basis of when temporary differences are expected to reverse.

14m relates to a deferred tax asset recognised on losses crystallised in the year.
Equity holders effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the tax attributable to equity holders over profit before tax attributable to equity holders.
The UK standard tax rate is used in the above reconciliation as a significant proportion of the groups profits are earned and are taxable in the UK.
The groups standard corporate income tax rate for the year, reflecting the standard tax rates of the countries we operate in, proportionately applied to profit before tax attributable to equity holders by country, is 20.3% 2015: 20.4%.

37 Share-based payments The fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
i Description of schemes The group provides a number of equity settled share-based long term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.
The Savings related share option scheme SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the Performance Share Plan PSP, based upon individual and company performance.
Pre the 2014 award, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the groups relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
New performance conditions attached to awards from 2014 result in the number of shares being transferred being equally dependent on the groups relative TSR and Earnings per Share EPS Dividend per Share DPS growth.
In addition, the shares vest evenly over three, four and five years.
The company share option scheme CSOP, approved by HMRC, and unapproved Executive share option scheme ESOS are designed to provide a long term incentive to directors and managers of the group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers grade, salary and performance.
In order for the options to be exercisable, Legal & Generals TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.
Fair value is calculated using a binomial model, reflecting the historic exercise patterns.
The Share bonus plan SBP awards restricted shares and nil-paid options.
Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments.
198 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional financial information continued Under the Employee share plan ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first 20 of the employees contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between 20 and 150.
From time to time, the group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.

200 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional financial information continued 38 Share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any group entity purchases the companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the balance sheet.

42 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.
Various group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Office on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals.
Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies liabilities under the group pension fund and scheme.
LGAS has provided indemnities, a liquidity and expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities liquidity facility in respect of the liabilities of group companies to facilitate the groups matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.

Future developments In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for virtually all lease contracts, bringing commitments in relation to operating leases as currently defined in IAS 17, Leases onto the balance sheet.
The impact of the standard on lessor accounting is significantly smaller with the provisions remaining closely aligned to those in IAS 17 although the IASB have issued updated guidance on the definition of a lease.
An assessment of the impacts of the standard on the groups financial statements will be completed in 2017.
The group does not intend to early adopt this standard.
