The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 6 December 2016.
Basis of preparation Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU endorsed IFRS and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 36.
In addition, note 14 on financial risk management details the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks, including currency and credit risk.
The Group has significant positive cash balances and has a committed bank facility of 40m which expires in September 2017.
This facility was undrawn at 30 September 2016 and remained undrawn at 6 December 2016 when these consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors.
The Directors have performed a robust assessment, including a review of the budget for the year ended 30 September 2017 and longer-term strategic forecasts and plans including consideration of the principal risks faced by the Company, as detailed on pages 22 to 24.
Following this review the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate and meet their liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements.
Details of the Groups policy on liquidity risk and capital management are included in note 14 to the financial statements.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part oftheapproved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with endorsed IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates andassociated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewedon an ongoing basis.
Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 20.
The accounting policies set out in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financialstatements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards were effective for the financial year ending 30 September 2016, whichincluded: u Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 u Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20122014 Cycle u Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 1 None of these have had a material impact to the Groups consolidated result or financial position.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective and, accordingly, the Group has not yet adopted them.
The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not expected tobesignificant.

Income tax expense Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except totheextent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Acquisition The acquisition method is used to account for business combinations.
Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired, including intangibles, and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
In the event that this difference is negative, theamount is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that are not classified as equity are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Prior year acquisitions Acquisition of Kleiss Gears On 18 June 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Kleiss Gears, Inc a Wisconsin corporation and Kleiss Precision Tool Corp. a Wisconsin corporation for a cash consideration of $5.8m 3.8m.
In addition, debt of $0.4m 0.3m was paid on behalf ofKleiss Gears, Inc and Kleiss Precision Tool Corp, taking total consideration to $6.2m 4.1m.
The net identifiable assets on acquisition of $3.4m 2.2m included intangible assets of $0.9m 0.6m, representing the fair value of Kleiss unique computer software and customer relationships, and property, plant and equipment of $1.9m 1.2m including a building purchased from Kleiss Environmental LLC, a related party of Kleiss Gears, as part of the purchase agreement.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of $2.4m 1.6m, see note 9 is best considered as goodwill on acquisition representing employee expertise and anticipated future operating synergies.
See note 9 for further details.
All of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The measurement period concluded in the year ended 30 September 2016, with no measurement adjustments being made to the fair values in this period.
Property, plant and equipment Owned assets All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable thatfuture economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Allother repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Buildings 3050 years Plant and machinery 1030 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 510 years Computers and motor vehicles 35 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, andadjusted if appropriate.
Depreciation on assets classified as in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the incomestatement.

Details of significant projects reclassified are included in the Financial Review.
The Company has no property, plant or equipment.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payables as follows: 2016 2015 As at 30 September m m Not later than one year 1.4 1.0 Later than one year but not later than five years 1.5 2.0 Later than five years 2.3 2.5 5.2 5.5 There are no finance lease agreements for either the Group or Company.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Anyimpairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the net amount recorded previously under UK GAAP.
In prior years the amortisation element of the deemed cost at 30 September 2004 wasshown separately: in the current year this has been deducted from gross cost.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1October 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities andcontingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit CGU, discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group thatgenerates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated exceeds its value in use andare recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised is measured against discounted future cash flow projections for the relevant CGU.
Management has prepared cash flow projections for a five-year period derived from the approved budget for the 2017 financial year and the five-year strategy.
These forecasts include assumptions around volumes and sales prices, costs of manufacture, operating costs, working capital movements and capital expenditure.
1.6m of goodwill was recognised in the prior period on the acquisition of Kleiss Gears.
This element of goodwill is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of the Kleiss Gears business.
The long-term average growth rate used was 2.0% 2015: 2.0% and the risk adjusted discount rate was 11.0% 2015: 11.0%.
Based on the impairment results, it has been determined to be unlikely that any reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
The remaining goodwill comprises 10.1m in Victrex Polymer Solutions relating to acquisitions associated with the supply of our key raw material BDF in 1999 and 2005 7.4m and the residual balance of our Japanese joint venture in 2007 2.7m.
This element of goodwill is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of our Victrex Polymer Solutions business unit excluding Kleiss Gears.
The long-term average growth rate used was 2.0% 2015: 2.0% and the risk adjusted discount rate was 8.0% 2015: 8.0%.
The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment.
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Intangible assets continued Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives as follows: Computer software 57 years straight line Customer relationships 10 years systematic Amortisation on assets classified as in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, the point of which they are reclassified from assets under construction, on the same basis as other assets of that class.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, isrecognised within the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Research and development expenditure of 14.1m 2015: 13.7m was expensed to the income statement in the year within sales, marketing and .
Investments Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments are stated at cost less any impairment in the value of the investment.
In the Groups financial statements accounting for investments is driven by the level of control that can be exerted.
An investor controls aninvestee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Where there is deemed to be an ability to affect the return, investments are consolidated from the date that ability commences until the date that it ceases.
Where there is not deemed to be an ability to affect the return, investments are held at fair value.
The initial fair value is deemed to be cost where transactions are at arms length.
For investments in unquoted companies, cost will continue to be used as a proxy for fair value unless there is a clear indication for a change in value, which could be illustrated by significant performance variations to plan or the value implied by subsequent funding rounds or other equity transactions.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated inpreparing the consolidated financial statements.

Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost offinished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads allocated based on normal operating capacity.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Further details oninventory valuation and provisions are included in note 20.

Financial risk management Group Currency risk Currently, the Group exports 97% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
Currency risk is managed by the Currency Committee, which is chaired by the Group Finance Director and comprises the Chief Executive and senior finance executives.
It meets monthly to review and manage the Groups currency hedging activities, in line with the hedging policy approved by the Board.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging: a minimum of 90% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising from trading in the forthcoming six-month u period: and a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising in the following six-month period.
u Profitability can vary due to the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the unhedged portion of the transaction exposures and from revised forecasts of future trading, which can lead to an adjustment of currency cover in place.
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries.
As a result of these factors, the Groups financial statements are exposed to currency fluctuations.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on profit for 2016 is 5.0m, 3.3m and 0.7m 2015: 5.8m, 3.7m and 0.7m respectively.
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling US Dollar, Sterling Euro and Sterling Yen rates on equity for 2016 is 2.8m, 0.4m and 0.6m 2015: 2.9m, 0.5m and 0.4m respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value.
The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whetherthe derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.
TheGroupalso documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are usedinhedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the incomestatement.

Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities ofless than one year after the balance sheet date.
The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periodswhen the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time when the forecast transaction occurs, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, is recognised in the income statement.
The timing of the gain or loss impacting the income statement is aligned to the timing of the hedged transaction impacting the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected tooccur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts and swaps are as follows: As at 30 September 2016 As at 30 September 2015 Notional Carrying Notional Carrying contract amount and contract amount and amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Current assets 22.1 2.1 22.2 2.0 Current liabilities 196.9 19.5 161.1 4.4 174.8 17.4 183.3 2.4 The fair values have been calculated by applying where relevant, for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.
These are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The following table indicates the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts for which hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur: As at 30 September 2016 As at 30 September 2015 Expected Expected cash 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 cash 6 months 6 to 12 12 to 18 flows or less months months flows or less months months m m m m m m m m Forward exchange contracts: Assets 22.1 24.3 1.1 1.1 22.2 14.9 6.5 0.8 Liabilities 196.9 122.4 68.3 6.2 161.1 83.5 68.8 8.8 174.8 98.1 69.4 7.3 183.3 98.4 75.3 9.6 Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2016 will be recognised in the income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is typically 12 months prior to the cash flow occurring.
At 30 September 2016, there are a number of hedged foreign currency transactions which are expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months.
During the year, losses of 5.8m 2015: losses of 0.4m relating to forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet at 30 September 2016 were released to the income statement.
Gains and losses recognised in the income statement on contracts which are yet to settle are adjusted as a non-cash movement on the cash flow statements.
This equated to a loss of 5.4m in the year 2015: 1.0m loss.

Financial risk management continued Group continued Credit risk The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Executive Leadership Team approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate.
Internal procedures require regular due consideration of credit ratings, payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection.
All customers are assigned a credit limit which issubject to annual review.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2016 2015 As at 30 September m m Amounts neither past due nor impaired 35.2 21.4 Amounts past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days 2.3 2.9 3060 days 0.2 0.9 More than 60 days 0.1 Total past due but not impaired 2.5 3.9 Amounts impaired all more than 60 days past due 0.5 0.5 Impairment allowances 0.5 0.5 Carrying amount of impaired receivables Trade receivables net of allowances 37.7 25.3 Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
No provision has been made in respect of the amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable in full.
Movements in the allowance for impairments were: 2016 2015 m m At beginning of year 0.5 0.5 Charge in the year Release of allowance At end of year 0.5 0.5 The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are established international banks whose credit ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term deposits with original maturities typically of three months or less.
As at 30 September 2016, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 28.0m 2015: 14.3m for the Group.
As at 30September 2016, the largest mark to market exposure for gains on forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was 1.0m 2015: 1.0m.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, either in the form of the Groups cash resources or committed bank facilities.
The Group has sufficient funds available to meet its current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure.
In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the Group has a committed bank facility of 40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end.
This facility expires in September 2017.
As at 30 September 2016, the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of 64.0m.
Price risk The Groups products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas.
Any increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Groups results.
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible.
The Group has a significant degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Groups total equity.
The Groups policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth of the business.
The Board does not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2017, although there is a resolution proposed at each AGM to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number of shares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM notice.

For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.
Company The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by UK subsidiary undertakings, which are financial assets designated asloans and receivables.
Retirement benefit obligations Employee benefits Defined contribution pension schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past service costs not yet recognised.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costsand the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in profit or loss.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses through the statement of comprehensive income as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world.
Outside the UK, the Company operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which employees of UK subsidiary undertakings participate.
The scheme has two sections.
One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001.
From this date new employees have been invited to join the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

Retirement benefit obligations continued Employee benefits continued Defined benefit pension schemes continued In December 2015 we communicated a proposal to consult on the closure of Victrexs UK defined benefit scheme to future accrual.
The scheme closed on 31 March 2016, with employees in the defined benefit scheme eligible to join the defined contribution scheme.
As part of the closure, Victrex made a cash contribution of 3.6m into the defined benefit scheme.
A non-cash curtailment gain of 2.6m was recognised in the income statement, representing the one-off reduction in accounting liabilities as benefits are no longer linked to future salary increases.
This gain has beenreduced by a charge of 1.5m, for transitional benefits provided to active pension scheme members and the costs of closing the scheme.
IAS 19 disclosures relating to defined benefits are as follows: Principal actuarial assumptions As at 30 September 2016 2015 Discount rate 2.40% 4.00% RPI inflation 3.50% 3.50% CPI inflation 2.50% 2.50% Future salary increases n a 3.50% Future pension increases 3.30% 3.40% Mortality tables S2NA CMI 2015 1.25% S1NA CMI 2014 1.25% Life expectancy from age 62 of current pensioners: 1 2 Male 25.3 yrs 25.1 yrs 1 2 Female 27.5 yrs 27.7 yrs Life expectancy from age 62 of active and deferred members: 3 4 Male 26.8 yrs 26.7 yrs 3 4 Female 29.1 yrs 29.4 yrs 1 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 62 in 2016.

3 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 45 in 2016.
4 Life expectancy from age 62 for members aged 45 in 2015.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 23 years 2015: 23 years.
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant: Increase in fund deficit Increase in fund deficit Change in assumption as at 30 September 2016 as at 30 September 2015 Reduce discount rate by 1% p. a.
22.7m 15.2m Increase inflation expectations by 1% p. a.
18.6m 13.6m Increase salary inflation by 1% p. a.
3.1m Increase life expectancy by 1 year 2.7m 1.5m In reality one might expect interrelationships between the assumptions, especially between discount rate and expected salary increases thatboth depend to a certain extent on expected inflation rates.
The above analysis does not take the effect of these interrelationships intoaccount.

Share-based payments All options are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows: Victrex 2005 2015 Executive Share Option Plan ESOP All employees are eligible to participate.
The Remuneration Committee currently excludes executive Directors from participating in this plan.
Option awards are based on a percentage of basic salary, not exceeding 100% of salary in each financial year.
The exercise price of the options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
ESOP options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period and achieving the performance condition where applicable.
The level of awards vesting will vary depending on EPS growth.
In order for awards to reach the threshold level of vest, the EPS growth of the Group must exceed the Retail Prices Index by 2% per annum.
For awards over 33% of salary, the threshold increases to 3%, and then to 4% for awards over 66%.
Straight line vesting will occur to the extent that EPS growth falls between these annual EPS growth targets.
These options are exercisable from the date of vest to the ten-year anniversary of the grant date.
Victrex 2005 2015 Sharesave Plan UK resident employees and full-time Directors of the Company or any designated participating subsidiary are eligible to participate.
The exercise price of the granted Sharesave Plan options is equal to the market price of the ordinary shares less 20% on the date of grant.
Victrex 2005 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan US-based employees including executive Directors are eligible to participate.
The price payable for each ordinary share shall be a price determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of an ordinary share on the date ofgrant or the date of purchase.
Awards may be granted over a number of ordinary shares determined by the amount employees have saved by the end of a one-year savings period.
Victrex 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2009 LTIP Each year executive Directors, and senior executives by invitation, are eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 150% of basic salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such asrecruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employees annual basic salary.
Details of the 2009 LTIP can be found within the Directors Remuneration Report on page 54.

Share-based payments continued Fair value of share options and assumptions Share-based payment transactions and employee share ownership trusts ESOT The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefiting from the service of the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the Companys share price, such as earnings per share growth.
The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or total shareholder return, would not result in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when theoptions are exercised.
The Group and Company provide finance to the ESOT to purchase Company shares in the open market.
Costs of running the ESOT arecharged to the income statement.
The cost of shares held by the ESOT are deducted in arriving at equity until they are exercised byemployees.
All share-based payment costs are recharged to the trading entities.

Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Directors have made in the process of applyingthe Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Management has discussed these with the Audit Committee.
These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies provided in the notes to the financial statements.
Inventory valuation The valuation of inventory includes the absorption of manufacturing costs over a normal level of production.
Judgement is used both in identification of directly attributable costs and normal production.
The assessment of normal production considers actual, prior period andbudgeted production when concluding on the appropriate level.
Management use their detailed experience in this process.
Inventory provisions are put in place for slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory where cost is considered to be higher than net realisable value.
The level of provisioning being a judgement based on ageing, customer order profiles, alternative routes to market and the option tore-process.
Pension scheme The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy.
The valuation is prepared by independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied, investment returns and member longevity, which underpin the valuations.
Note 15 contains information about the assumptions relating toretirement benefit obligations.
Property, plant and equipment In relation to property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that could lead to a change in the useful economic life or a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets.
Historically, changes in carrying value, useful lives or residual values have not resulted in material changes to either the carrying value oftheGroups assets or the annual depreciated expense.

Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Tax provisioning The Group operates in a number of geographies and different tax jurisdictions.
There is an inherent uncertainty in some of these jurisdictions requiring judgement at period ends over the amount of taxation payable.
Management use their experience of each geographyalong with that of their advisors in estimating the tax charge for the period and any provision required for previous periods.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The nature of the Groups business is such that financial obligations can come from a range of sources.
IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets sets out strict criteria on when provisions and contingent liabilities can be recognised in a number of common scenarios: including restructuring, claims and onerous contracts.
Recognition is based on an assessment of a potential financial obligation, whether legal or constructive, when the obligation arose and its probability of arising along with the likelihood of a transfer of economic benefit.
Processes are in place to capture the potential obligations and then assess them against the criteria outlined in IAS 37.
Management use their judgement, experience and external expertise to assess the probability and magnitude of potential liabilities where appropriate.
The assessment performed covers both recognition and disclosure of potential provisions and contingent liabilities.
Research and development expenditure The Group incurs significant expenditure on research and development, both in respect of internal process improvement and product andapplication development.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets sets out strict criteria in respect of capitalising development costs, which require an element of judgement to assess if these have been made.
The nature of our business is such that new products and applications often need to go through lengthy client testing and regulatory approval, the success of which is inherently uncertain and therefore predicting theoutcome requires a significant level of judgement.
As such, until these phases are complete the expenditure is not considered to meet the IAS 38 criteria, by which point the significant majority of development expenditure has been incurred.
Accordingly no development expenditure has been capitalised in the current or prior years.
Exchange rates Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operated the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
In addition, where an exchange difference arises on an intragroup monetary item that, in substance, forms part of the entitys net investment in a foreign operation, these differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements and accumulated in equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have afunctional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: u income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates: and u all resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
