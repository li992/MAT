ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these financial statements, are set out below: a Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared under UK Company Law, UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, dated November 2014, for Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of investments at fair value and on a going concern basis, as set out on page 28.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has applied FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Ireland, for the first time.
On adopting FRS 102 there have been no changes to the Companys accounting policies nor restatements required to the Companys previously reported financial position and financial performance.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under FRS102, as it is an investment fund thats investments are substantially all highly liquid and carried at fair market value.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling, being the functional and presentational currency of the Company.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
In addition, investments held at fair value are categorised into a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has early adopted Amendments to FRS102: Fair value hierarchy disclosures March 2016 published by the FRC.
Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the SORP, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. b Investments Investments are measured initially, and at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value, and are recognised and fiderecognised at trade date where a purchase or sale is under a contract whose terms require delivery within the time frame established by the market concerned.
For quoted securities fair value is either bid price or last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Unquoted debt investments are fair valued using the bid price from a publicly available source or a broker.
Changes in fair value and gains or losses on disposal are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Worldwide Healthcare Trust PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016 52 3 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued c Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments namely put and call options and equity swaps.
All derivative instruments are valued initially, and at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position.
The equity swaps are accounted for as Fixed Assets and Options are accounted for as Current Assets or Current Liabilities.
Options are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and gains and losses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement, where the option has been entered into to generate or protect capital returns.
All of the put and call options bought and sold during the year have been capital in nature.
All gains and losses on over-the-counter OTC equity swaps are accounted for as gains or losses on investments.
Where there has been a re-positioning of the swap, gains and losses are accounted for on a realised basis.
All such gains and losses have been debited or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Cash collateral held by counterparties is included within cash, except where there is a right of offset against the overdraft facility.
d Investment income Dividends receivable are recognised on the ex-dividend date.
Where no ex-dividend date is quoted, dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
UK dividends are shown net of tax credits and foreign dividends are grossed up at the appropriate rate of withholding tax.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate.
Deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement: and expenses are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the portfolio management and AIFM fees have been charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the portfolio management and AIFM fees are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any performance fee accrued or paid is charged in full to the capital column of the Income Statement.
f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs are charged to the Income Statement in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income, from the Companys portfolio.
As a result 5% of the finance costs are charged to the revenue column of the Income Statement and 95% are charged to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Finance charges, if applicable, including interest payable and premiums on settlement or redemption, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the Statement of Financial Position date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided for at the rate of tax enacted or substantially enacted.
h Foreign currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Statement of Financial Position date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Any gains or losses on the translation of foreign currency balances, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital or the revenue column of the Income Statement, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature.
i Capital reserve The following are transferred to this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments: exchange differences of a capital nature: expenses, together with the related taxation effect, in accordance with the above policies: and changes in the fair value of investments and derivatives.
This reserve can be used to distribute realised capital profits by way of dividend.
Any gains in the fair value of investments that are not readily convertible to cash are treated as unrealised gains in the capital reserve.
j Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when ordinary shares were redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled.
When ordinary shares are redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled, an amount equal to the par value of the ordinary share capital is transferred from the ordinary share capital to the capital redemption reserve.
k Revenue reserve The revenue reserve is distributable by way of dividend.
l Dividend payments Dividends paid by the Company on its shares are recognised in the financial statements in the year in which they are paid and are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk management policies and procedures The Companys financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, derivative instruments, cash balances, loans, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on pages 5 and 6.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market risk including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk ii liquidity risk iii credit risk These risks, with the exception of liquidity risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 5 and 6 and have not changed from the previous accounting year.
The AIFM, in close co-operation with the Board and the Portfolio Manager co-ordinate the Companys risk management.
Use of derivatives As noted in the Strategic Report, on pages 5 and 6, options and equity swaps are used within the Companys portfolio.
More details on options and swaps can be found in the Glossary on pages 69 and 70.
Worldwide Healthcare Trust PLC 61 Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016 Put and call options OrbiMed employs, when appropriate, options strategies in an effort to enhance returns and to improve the risk-return profile of the Companys portfolio.
The Board monitor the use of options through a monthly report, summarising the options activity and strategic intent, provided by OrbiMed.
OrbiMed employs the following option strategies, or a combination of such: Buy calls: provides leveraged long exposure while minimising capital at risk: Buy puts: provides leveraged protection, against price falls while minimising capital at risk: Sell calls: against an existing position, provides partial protection from a decline in stock price, facilitates commitment to an exit strategy and exit price that is consistent with fundamental analysis: Sell puts: provides an effective entry price at which to add to an existing position, or provides an effective entry price at which to initiate a new position.
OTC equity swaps The Company uses OTC equity swap positions to gain access to the Indian and Chinese markets because the Company is not locally registered to trade in either market and to gain exposure to thematic baskets of stocks.
Details of funded and financed swap positions are noted in the Portfolio on pages 7 to 9.
Collateral cash of 22.9 million 2015: 9.0 million was held against the financed swap positions, of which 4.4 million 2015: 1.4 million was offset against the overdraft position.
Offsetting disclosure Swap basket trades and OTC derivatives are traded under ISDA Master Agreements.
The Company currently has such agreements in place with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
These agreements create a right of set-off that becomes enforceable only following a specified event of default, or in other circumstances not expected to arise in the normal course of business.
As a result, as the right of set-off is not unconditional, for financial reporting purposes, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities.
i Other price risk In pursuance of the Companys Investment Objective the Companys portfolio, including its derivatives, is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in market prices and foreign exchange rates.
The Board manage these risks through the use of limits and guidelines, monthly compliance reports from Frostrow and reports from Frostrow and OrbiMed presented at each Board meeting, as set out on pages 18 to 20. International Swap Dealers Association Inc. See Glossary beginning on page 69 for description of funded and financed swaps.

As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the sterling value of those items.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are shown below: 2016 2015 Current Current Current Current assets liabilities Investments assets liabilities Investments 000 000 000 000 000 000 U.
