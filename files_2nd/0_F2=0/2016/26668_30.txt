Whererequired, additional disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
c Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
The Directors consider annually whether a provision against the value of investments on an individual basis is required.
d Share capital i Share capital Share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or if it is redeemable but only at the Companys option.
Dividends on share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 121 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 27 Accounting policies continued e Pension schemes i Defined benefit scheme The Company participates in a Group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The defined benefit section ofthe scheme was closed to future service accrual in July 2006.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The defined benefit cost and contributions payable are borne by Marshalls Group Limited and, therefore, the defined benefit surplus or deficit is recorded in Marshalls Group Limited.
Full details are provided inNote 18 on pages 107 to 111. ii Defined contribution scheme Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
f Share-based payment transactions The Company enters into equity settled share-based payment transactions with its employees.
In particular, annual awards are made to employees under the Companys Management Incentive Plan MIP and, in previous years, the Performance Incentive Plan PIP and the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
These schemes allow employees to acquire shares in Marshalls plc.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Where appropriate, the fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to bemet, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Current tax relief is available as shares vest based on the value at the date of vesting.
A deferred tax asset is recognised at grant date based on the number of shares expected to be issued, at the value at which they are expected to be issued, proportioned in line with the vesting period.
g Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Group Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
h Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at nominal amount discounted if material.
i Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred taxation.
Income tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred taxation provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary difference reverses, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred taxation assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
