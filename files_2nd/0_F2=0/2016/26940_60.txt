For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate CGU: of the total balance of 4.1 million 2015: 4.1 million, 4.1 million, or 100% of the total, has been allocated to SME Invoice Finance Limited.
The recoverable amount of SME Invoice Finance Limited has been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a seven-year period and a discount rate of 10.55%.
The long-term growth rate is consistent with external sources of information reviewed by management.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of SME Invoice Finance Limited to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.
Seven years was used as the basis for discounted cash flow calculation to align with the 20162022 plan, prepared by management and approved by the Board, and used in decision-making.
The plan is reviewed and updated annually.
