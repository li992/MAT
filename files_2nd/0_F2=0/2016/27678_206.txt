It is a non-IFRS measure of profitability that reflects the Directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
The calculation of AOP adjusts basic IFRS profit for a number of items as detailed in note C1.
AOP is one of the bases by which operational performance is monitored and managed, similarly it is one of a range of measures by which management performance is assessed.
Further detail of the performance measures applied in determining management remuneration is available in the remuneration report in pages 104 to 139 of the Annual Report.
The adjusting items applied in calculating AOP seek to remove the impact of strategic activities: short-term valuation movements: IFRS accounting treatments that are not reflective of the operating activity: and non-operating items.
Due to the long-term nature of the majority of the Groups business, management believes that AOP is an appropriate alternative basis by which to assess the underlying operating results of these businesses and the Group as a whole and that it enhances the comparability and understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
The Group Audit Committee regularly reviews the use of determining AOP to confirm that it remains an appropriate basis on which to analyse the operating performance of the businesses.
The Committee assesses refinements to the policy on a case-by-case basis, however where possible the Group seeks to minimise such changes in order to maintain consistency over time.
Scope of businesses included in AOP AOP excludes the results of non-core operations, Old Mutual Bermuda, as these are not reflective of the underlying long-term operating performance of the Group.
Refer to note B1 for further information on the basis of segmentation.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the results of operating segments that were classified as held for sale and discontinued operations for IFRS reporting have been included in the determination of AOP.
This is a change in the AOP policy compared to policy applied in respect of previously disposed operating segments, such as US Life during 2010 and Nordic during 201 1.
As a result, the results of OM Asset Management plc OMAM have been included in AOP.
In the context of the current strategy, the Directors believe the inclusion of these results will assist with the comparability of year-on-year performance of the core operations as the Group implements its managed separation strategy.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 151 Adjustments to profit For all core businesses, AOP includes a number of adjustments intended to remove the impact of strategic activities.
These include the exclusion of the impairment of goodwill, the impact of accounting for intangible assets acquired in a business combination, costs related to completed acquisitions, and the profit or loss on disposal of subsidiaries note C1 b and C1 c. The definition of adjusting items was refined during 2016 to exclude the impairment of investments in associated undertakings note C1 b.
Management is of the opinion that these impairments of strategic investments are not reflective of the long-term underlying operating performance of the Group.
AOP is based on a long-term shareholder investment return for the life assurance and property & casualty businesses, which eliminates the short-term volatility movements in the value of shareholder assets note C1 d. Other short-term valuation movements excluded from AOP include fair value profits or losses on Group debt instruments note C1 h and the revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes note C1 g. The impacts of accounting treatments that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of the business are excluded from the determination of AOP.
These adjustments relate to the inclusion of dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities note C1 f, and the inclusion of returns on investments held by life funds in Group equity and debt instruments note C1 e. Costs related to the development of the new Old Mutual Wealth platform capability and outsourcing of UK business administration are excluded from AOP as management is of the view that this long-term investment in operational capability is a non-operating item note C1 i.
Adjusted Operating Profit per share Adjusted operating earnings applied in the calculation of adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated based on AOP after tax and non-controlling interests.
It is adjusted to exclude income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.
