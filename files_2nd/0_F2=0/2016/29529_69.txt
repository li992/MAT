DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Accounting policy Accounting for derivatives: Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instrument prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.
Derivatives are categorised as trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with revaluation gains recognised in profit or loss except where cash flow or net investment hedging has been achieved, in which case the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised within other comprehensive income.
Fair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate.
Where the initially recognised fair value of a derivative contract is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same initial recognition accounting policy as for other financial assets and liabilities.
All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
Certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond held, are valued as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives continue to be presented with the host contract and are not separately disclosed or included within derivatives.
Hedge accounting: The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: a hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedge b hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge c hedges of the net investment of a foreign operation net investment hedges Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way, provided certain criteria are met.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The Group may enter into economic hedges that do not qualify for IAS 39 hedge accounting treatment.
Where these economic hedges use derivative to offset risk, the derivatives are fair valued, with fair value changes recognised through profit or loss.
Fair value hedge: Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity or derecognition.
Cash flow hedge: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedge: Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the translation reserve: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.

As required by IAS 32, exposures are only presented net in these accounts where they are subject to legal right of offset and intended to be settled net in the ordinary course of business.
Details of the amounts available for offset are set out in note 13 on page 225.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange fixed rates for floating rates on funding to match floating rates received on assets, or exchange fixed rates on assets to match the floating rates paid on funding.
For qualifying hedges the fair value changes of the derivative are substantially matched by corresponding fair value changes of the hedged item, both of which are recognised in profit or loss.
All qualifying hedges were effective.

Includes amortisation of fair value adjustments in respect of hedges no longer qualifying for hedge accounting Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the variability in future cash flows on assets and liabilities that have floating rates of interest by exchanging the floating rates for fixed rates.
It also usesforeign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options to manage the variability in future exchange rates on its assets and liabilities and costs in foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges are deferred in equity until the variability on the cash flow affects profit or loss, atwhich time the gains or losses are transferred to profit and loss.
