Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The Group has two cash generating units CGU TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business For the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated toeach of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated Thevalue in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates touse to calculate present values Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired: this review is performed at a CGU level Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates The future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board approved five year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years based on the UKs long term growth rate This is discounted by the CGUs weighted average cost of capital pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU Where the net present value of future cash flows isless than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions 2016 2015 m m Opening cost and net book value 490 479 Acquisitions note 13 5 11 Closing cost and net book value 495 490 The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows: 2016 2015 m m TalkTalk Consumer 347 348 TalkTalk Business 148 142 495 490 84 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2016 11.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued a Goodwill continued Impairment review The key assumptions used in the Groups goodwill impairment review are as follows: Long term growth rates Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD The rate applied in the current year was 20% 2015: 22% Discount rate The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk ofthe CGU The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the forecast cash flows is 102% 2015: 90% The assumptions used inthe calculation of the CGUs discount rate are benchmarked to externally available data The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the similarity of risk factors and geographical location Capital expenditure Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the network and current run rate ofexpenditure, typically at 6% of revenue Customer factors The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth rates, ARPU, direct costs including acquisition costs, and changes in product mix The value assigned to each of these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group, adjusted for the impact of the cyber attack in the year and external information on expected trends of future market developments Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any reasonably possible changes inthekey assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount b Other intangible assets Accounting policy Operating intangibles Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for internal use Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be measured reliably Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred Directly attributable costs that are capitalised include employee costs specifically incurred in the development of the intangible asset Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years Acquisition intangibles Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six years on a straight line basis The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for contributory assets Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy Impairment At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows Determining whether the carrying amounts of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of impairment requires judgement Ifanindication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amounts can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates touse to calculate present values Useful economic lives The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement Amortisation is charged to theincome statement based on the useful economic life selected This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group willbenefit from the assets 85 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11.
