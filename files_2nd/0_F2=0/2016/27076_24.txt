Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC Company, a company incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2016, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2017.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland: these are presented on pages 105 to 111.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Groups positive cash position, continued growth and forecast profitability.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes: Note 12 capitalisation of software and development costs Note 13 revenue recognition Basis of consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Accounting for business combinations From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 in accounting for business combinations.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent amount payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent amount is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent amount are recognised in profit or loss.
Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it is treated as a cost of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007.
These comprised the incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon Nixons 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited from third parties.
The acquisition of Simon Nixons shares was between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction.
The acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
As a result the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages.
This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
Revenue The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer.
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Cost of Sales The Group recognises associated costs of internet lead generation in the period that the lead is generated.
Costs in respect of cashback payments to customers are included in cost of sales.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Office equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 87 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life, is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Non-compete agreement 4 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately.
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Investments in equity securities Fixed asset and short term investments in equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in IAS 38.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair values of the share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media.
Costs associated with the production of adverts are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying.
The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs Finance costs comprise of interest charged on borrowings, and the unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
The effective interest rate method is then used for subsequent re-measurement of borrowings at amortised cost.
The unwind of the discount on contingent remuneration is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an interest expense.
Operating leases Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Lease incentives and rent-free periods are amortised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the relevant lease.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 89 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which are acquired through business combinations representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
These liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 20 as a government grant.
The credit is recognised once a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.
Reserve for own shares The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based employee incentive plans.
In connection with these, shares in the Company are held by an Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
The assets and liabilities of the EBT are required to be consolidated within these accounts as it is deemed to be under fide facto control of the Group.
The assets of the EBT mainly comprise Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC shares, which are shown as a deduction from total equity at cost.
Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves where applicable, as well as unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by, where possible, depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk.
In December 2015, the Group secured a three-year revolving credit facility for an amount of 100m in committed funds provided in equal parts by Lloyds Bank PLC and Barclays Bank PLC with half-yearly covenant testing based on adjusted leverage and interest cover ratios.
The Group also has an accordion option to apply to the banks for up to an additional 100m of committed funds during the first two years of the facility.
This facility was extended to December 2019 for a fee of 175,000 in October 2016.
The Group has no amounts drawn down from the facility at 31 December 2016.
Management of capital focuses around the Groups ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted during the period The Group has adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not had a significant impact on the Groups results: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS16 and IAS38 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS1 90 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report G Gove over rn na an nc ce e F Finan inanc ci ial al S St tat ate em me ent nts s 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective IFRS 9 Financial instruments The standard was endorsed on 22 November 2016 and applies to an entitys first annual statements beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The revised standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and introduces new guidance for classification and measurement, impairment of financial instruments, and hedge accounting.
The cumulative impact on adoption of this standard is not expected to be significant.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customer The standard was endorsed on 22 September 2016 and applies to an entitys first annual statements beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
The standard introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in time or over time.
The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
We are assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and will conduct a systematic review to ensure that the impact of the new standard is fully understood in advance of the effective date.
It is not currently practicable to quantify the impact of this standard.
IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 and it is expected to apply to an entitys first annual statements beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 changes fundamentally the accounting for leases by lessees.
It eliminates the current IAS 17 dual accounting model, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases and, instead, introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting.
In preparation for the adoption of IFRS 16, in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019, management are in the process of assessing the potential impact.
Acquisitions OnTrees On 14 March 2014, the Group acquired the trade and assets of OnTrees for consideration of 1.5m paid in cash.
Accordingly 1.5m of goodwill was recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in relation to the acquisition.
OnTrees is a bank account and credit card aggregation service provider.
At 31 December 2015 the business strategy was to use OnTrees technology within MSE, however this strategy did not materialise and subsequently this goodwill has been impaired as the business has been aggregated within the mobile app and is now not expected to generate revenues for the foreseeable future.
Social Significance Limited On 22 February 2016, the Group acquired a 12.8% shareholding of Social Significance Limited for consideration of 0.5m paid in cash.
Accordingly 0.5m of investments has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in relation to the acquisition.
com MSE On 21 September 2012, the Group acquired certain trade and assets from Martin Lewis and his company MoneySavingExpert.
Additional amounts of up to 27.0m became payable on the third anniversary of the completion of the acquisition.
The amount payable depended in part upon the achievement of a number of non-financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement and was, in part, at the discretion of the Companys Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis.
The arrangement to pay these additional amounts was accounted for separately to the business combination as remuneration as their payment was linked to the employment of Martin Lewis.
The benefit payable was charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which services were provided the earnout period as an employment expense.
Management estimated the benefit payable by assessing, amongst other things, the performance of the acquired business since acquisition, against the measures specified in the purchase agreement.
Measurement was inherently subjective due to the nature of the earnout variables and the length and timing of the earnout period.
During the prior year 4.8m was charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as an employment expense.
The final payment of 20.6m was paid in November 2015.

Segmental information Business segments In applying IFRS 8 Operating segments, the Group has disclosed five reportable segments, being Money, Insurance, Travel, Home Services and MoneySavingExpert.
Money, Insurance and Home Services operate under the brand name MoneySuperMarket.
com, and Travel under the brand name TravelSupermarket.
com, however, all four segments are reported separately.
com is disclosed as a separate operating segment, with revenue generated by the shopping and vouchers channel reported within Other.
This disclosure correlates with the information which is presented to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which reviews revenue by segment.
The Groups costs, finance income, tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at a consolidated level, with the exception of MoneySavingExpert.

Taxation continued Reconciliation of the effective tax rate The tax charge for the year is lower 2015: higher than the effective standard rate of corporation tax in the UK in 2016 of 20% 2015: 20.25%.
The differences are explained below.

Further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% effective 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at the balance sheet date has been calculated based on these rates.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The Companys own shares held by employee trusts are excluded when calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the following basis: 2016 2015 Profit after taxation attributable to ordinary equity holders 000 73,531 63,434 Basic weighted average ordinary shares in issue millions 546.6 546.3 Dilutive effect of share-based instruments millions 2.2 2.6 Diluted weighted average ordinary shares in issue millions 548.8 548.9 Basic earnings per ordinary share p 13.5 11.6 Diluted earnings per ordinary share p 13.4 11.6 10.

The transfer relates to Research & Development tax credits claimed on the development cost relating to the technology related intangible assets.
As highlighted in Note 2, there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the recognition of costs incurred in developing technology related intangible assets.
This is due to the asset recognition criteria being predicated on future economic benefit flowing to that asset.
Management are confident however that any spend capitalised satisfies the criteria of IAS38 Intangible Assets and, where relevant, SIC-32 Intangible Assets Web Site Costs.
On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, see page 98 for the assessment for technology related assets.

Intangible assets continued During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.
This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for these assets.
Following the impairment in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group.
At 31 December 2016 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% 2015: more than 100%.
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units CGU that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8.
These CGUs are the five operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel, Home Services and MoneySavingExpert.
The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU level.
For the original four segments, the goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with 30.7m allocated to Insurance, 15.5m to Money, 6.6m to Travel and 2.2m to Home Services.
The balances at 31 December 2016 are in line with those at 1 January 2009.
Goodwill impairment testing for MoneySavingExpert.
com has been considered separately from the four operating segments outlined above and the Group.
Impairment review by vertical and Group For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions: Cash flows for years 13 for each CGU represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2016, and are based upon the Groups approved three year strategic plan incorporating cost of sales, advertising and an allocation of overhead costs.
The main assumptions underlying the plan relate to visitor volumes, source of visitors, revenue per transaction visitor and marketing spend, which incorporate past experience.
The forecast assumes continued growth during the course of the next three years, driven by new media campaigns, exploitation of the Groups data asset and further investments made during 2016 in the core technology underpinning the Groups key channels.
Cash flows after three years assume no growth.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% 2015: 13.5% has been used in the forecast for the Travel, Insurance, Money and Home Services segments.
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years dependent on changes to the macro-economic environment.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100% 2015: 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment.
Therefore the cash flows estimated for these segments include all of the Groups forecast revenues and an allocation of the Groups forecast costs.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous years.
In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows, which has been calculated with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Groups assets exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100% 2015: 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, no reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment 2015:same.
com and OnTrees During 2015, the intention was for OnTrees to be integrated within the strategic plans of MSE and as such the Goodwill relating to the OnTrees acquisition was allocated to the MoneySavingExpert.
These plans did not materialise during 2016 and management instead decided to operate OnTrees as a test and learn data asset rather than seeking to generate cash flows.
With this in mind, the 1.5m of Goodwill relating to OnTrees has been fully impared in the period.
com CGU and allocated Goodwill of 52.6m has therefore been tested on a stand alone basis excluding OnTrees.
Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 97 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows using the following key assumptions: Cash flows for the first three years represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2016, and are based upon the Groups approved three year strategic plan.
The main assumptions underlying the plan relate to visitor numbers, the amount of revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business.
The forecast assumes an improvement over the next three years, driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
A pre-tax discount rate of 16.2% 2015: 16.2% has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100% 2015: 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the impairment testing, no reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment 2015: same.
Impairment testing of technology related intangible assets Technology related intangible assets in use by the Group are tested for impairment if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The Group also conducts annual impairment testing of significant technology related intangible assets under development and not yet available for use.
Project Reset and Enterprise Data Warehouse EDW The Group is currently undertaking a significant investment in technology infrastructure to resolve a number of issues with legacy systems and to provide a market-leading, cloud enabled technology stack.
A supporting element to this project is the development of an Enterprise Data Warehouse EDW to act as a data repository and drive improvements in understanding the business and enriching the customer experience.
The investment programme has also included a number of other elements such as Project Reset which has transformed the front end of the MoneySuperMarket.
As the EDW is not yet fully available for use management have conducted impairment testing as at 31 December 2016.
The EDW is designed to perform synergistically with Project Reset as part of the technology stack and management have therefore performed an investment appraisal on a combination of both projects, although Project Reset is already being amortised by the Group.
The recoverable amount has been based on the present value of future cash flows using the following key assumptions: Cash flows over the three year useful economic life of the asset represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2016, and are based upon the Groups approved three year strategic plan for 2017 2019.
The main assumptions underlying the cash flows relate to improvements in conversion and cross buying and changes in costs for data hosting facilities and service maintenance contracts and will be driven by exploitation of the Groups data asset and further investments to be made.
The cash flows are flexed to account for unexpected delays.
No impact of the reduction in existing cash flows due to obsolescence of legacy systems if the Projects had not taken place is included due to the difficulty in quantifying and attributing this value.
Cash flows into perpetuity have not been incorporated into the calculation for prudence, however the asset is expected to generate economic benefit for the Group significantly past 2019.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% has been used in the forecast, consistent with the goodwill impairment testing performed at a Group and CGU level.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value by 3.0m 2015: 1.0m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
The value in use calculations have taken into account both prudent assumptions and useful lives and exclude cash flows which although difficult to quantify would likely be significant and still no impairment exists.
It is on this basis, that management do not consider an impairment to exist at 31 December 2016.
My Suitcase When considering the impairment indicators relating to technology related assets, the Group identified that the My Suitcase functionality developed for use on the TSM website was in the process of being decommissioned due to lower usage than expected.
As the asset will not be in use during 2017, management fully impaired the remaining carrying value of 662,000.

As a result of click based revenue being recognised in the period that the lead is generated, there is an element of subjectivity in calculating a revenue accrual as a result of estimating the number of successful applications on the providers website in the period between the latest provider data available and the year end.
This revenue accrual can typically represent approximately one months revenue.
The accrued revenue is estimated by considering the volume of clicks that have passed from the Groups websites through to provider websites in the period, the historic conversion of such clicks into completed product purchases, and contracted revenue per transaction.
From historical experience and post year end confirmation, the Group expects any differences between the amounts accrued at year end and those amounts subsequently billed to be not materially different.
A - 1% difference of the 24.6m revenue accrual 2015: 18.3m would equate to approximately 0.2m 2015: 0.2m.
At 31 December 2016, trade receivables are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts of 427,375 2015: 188,000, which represents a judgement made by management of which receivables balances are unlikely to be recovered taking into consideration the ageing of the debt, evidence of poor payment history or financial position of a particular debtor.

Financial instruments Interest rate risk The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks.
Interest earned therefore closely follows movements in Bank of England base rates.
A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax profit of 446,000 2015: 167,000 based on Group cash, cash equivalents and financial instruments at 31 December 2016.
At the balance sheet date, 29.7m was invested with Lloyds Banking Group, this being the most invested with any one bank.
Effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the year end date: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Effective Effective interest rate 000 interest rate 000 Cash and cash equivalents 0.45% 44,572 0.50% 16,662 Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties as a means of mitigating risk of financial loss from default.
The Groups exposure is continuously monitored by the credit control team and finance management.
Of the top 75% of the Groups providers by revenue, approximately 41% 2015: 50% of these are UK quoted companies with the remainder being a mixture of larger UK independent companies and overseas owned or quoted companies.
At the balance sheet date, the five largest trade receivables, by provider, accounted for 15% 2015: 12% of the total trade receivables balance of 35,715,000 2015: 27,963,000 and the largest individual balance was 1,982,343 2015: 1,865,344.
The Group does not consider it has any material contracts with providers in any one channel.
Fair values The Groups financial assets and liabilities are principally short-term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially different from their carrying value.
The valuation method for the Groups financial assets and liabilities can be defined as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial assets and liabilities are valued at amortised cost.
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.
Liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risks, are set out below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 000 000 Unsecured bank loan facilities with a maturity date of 7 December 2018 amount used amount unused 100,000 Unsecured bank loan facilities with a maturity date of 7 December 2019 amount used amount unused 100,000 In December 2015, the Group secured a new three-year revolving credit facility for an amount of 100m in committed funds provided in equal parts by Lloyds Bank Plc and Barclays Bank Plc.
This replaced the previously facility provided by Lloyds.
In November 2016, the Group exercised its option to extend the three-year revolving credit facility by a further year to December 2019.
Interest would be payable on the new facility at a rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate based on the adjusted leverage of the Group.

Commitments and contingencies Along with most companies of our size, the Group is a defendant in a small number of disputes incidental to its operations and from time to time is under regulatory scrutiny.
As a leading website operator, the Group occasionally experiences operational issues due to errors in operating procedures or technology which result in incorrect or incomplete product or customer data being transferred to or from providers.
These issues can in some instances lead to customer detriment, dispute and potentially cash outflows.
During 2016, there were two such issues but the Group does not expect either of them to have a significant impact.
The Group has a Professional Indemnity Insurance Policy in order to mitigate liabilities arising out of events such as this.
In aggregate, the commitments and contingencies outlined above are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Group.
