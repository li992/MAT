Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 122 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Basis of preparation 1.1 Reporting entity Shawbrook Group plc is domiciled in the UK.
The Companys registered office is at Lutea House, Warley Hill Business Park, The Drive, Great Warley, Brentwood, Essex, CM13 3BE.
The consolidated Financial statements of Shawbrook Group plc, for the year ended 31 December 2016, comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and individually as Group entities.
1.2 Basis of accounting The Groups Financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The Financial statements are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
No individual profit or loss account or related notes are presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 4 of the Companies Act 2006.
1.3 Functional and presentation currency The consolidated Financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company and its subsidiaries functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the restatement and settlement of such transactions are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items which are assets and liabilities which do not attach to a right to receive or an obligation to pay a fixed or determinable number of units of currency denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
1.4 IPO costs Qualifying costs directly attributable to the issue of share capital were charged directly to equity and other associated costs were charged to the income statement.
1.5 Going concern The Financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for at least 12 months following the year end.
In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including the current state of the balance sheet, future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources and the longer term strategy of the business.
The Groups capital and liquidity plans, including stress tests, have been reviewed by the Directors.
The Groups forecasts and projections suggest that it will be able to operate at adequate levels of both liquidity and capital for at least 12 months following the year end, including in a range of stressed scenarios, assuming the availability of alternative sources of capital if required and appropriate management actions.
After making due enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to continue its activities for at least 12 months following the year end, and the Group has sufficient capital to enable it to continue to meet its regulatory capital requirements as set out by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
1.6 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Entities are regarded as subsidiaries where the Group has the power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to affect those returns.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns and the ability to affect these returns ceases.
A Special Purpose Entity SPE is an entity which is formed for a single, well-defined and narrow, lawful purpose.
The Group did not have any SPEs in the year.
Accounting policies are applied consistently across the Group.
These Financial statements consolidate the results of the subsidiary companies set out in Note 31.
Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 123 1.
Basis of preparation continued 1.7 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial statements in conformity with IFRS adopted in the EU requires Management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on Managements best knowledge of the amount, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial statements are disclosed within the notes to the Financial statements which the estimate or judgement relates to as follows: Note Area of significant judgement or estimate reference Effective interest rate 3 Impairment of loans and advances 14 Impairment assessment of goodwill 17 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
1.8 Other reserves Capital redemption reserve This is a statutory, non-distributable reserve into which amounts are transferred following the redemption or purchase of a companys own shares.
The provisions relating to the capital redemption reserve are set out in section 733 of the Companies Act 2006.
1.9 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of International Accounting Standards Board IASB pronouncements have been issued but are not effective for this financial year.
The standards considered most relevant to the Group are as follows: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Effective from 1 January 2018, the standard replaces IAS 39, addressing recognition, basis of valuation, income recognition methods, impairment and hedging for financial instruments.
While areas such as the amortised cost basis of valuation and the effective interest rate method of recognition are largely unchanged in the new standard, the new basis of accounting for impairments is likely to have a significant impact on the Group due to the requirement for earlier recognition of losses.
The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, loan receivables, certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
At initial recognition, an allowance or provision in the case of commitments and guarantees is required for expected credit losses ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months 12 month ECL.
In the event of a significant increase in the credit risk, allowance or provision is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument lifetime ECL.
Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be Stage 1: financial assets, which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in Stage 2: and financial assets, which there is objective evidence of impairment so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired are in Stage 3.
The assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed for each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument, rather than by considering the increase in ECL.
Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 124 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Basis of preparation continued The assessment of credit risk and estimated ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should incorporate all available information which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date.
In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.
As a result, the recognition and measurement of the impairment is intended to be more forward-looking than under IAS 39 and the resulting impairment charge will tend to be more volatile.
It will also tend to result in an increase in the total level of impairment allowances, since all financial assets will be assessed for at least 12 month ECL and the population for financial assets to which lifetime ECL applies is likely to be larger than the population for which there is objective evidence of impairment in accordance with IAS 39.
During 2016 and continuing into 2017, there has been a particular focus on the Groups preparedness for IFRS 9 which aims to ensure that the Group has the necessary systems and processes in place ahead of the effective date.
Progress has been made on developing the Expected Credit Loss models, including our Credit Grading Framework.
The IFRS 9 program, which is jointly sponsored by the CFO and CRO and managed by a dedicated management committee, includes defining the IFRS 9 methodology and accounting policies, identifying data, reconciliation and system requirements, and the development and establishment of appropriate and compliant operating models within an appropriate governance framework, is currently within its build phase with testing and implementation due to take place by the end of 2017.
The Group is on track to begin running the Expected Credit Loss models in parallel with the current risk models in Q2 of 2017.
Until such time as the Expected Credit Loss models, encompassing the Credit Grading Framework and future looking economic scenarios, have been tested, the Group does not plan to quantify the extent of the impacts of IFRS 9.
The classification and measurement categories prescribed in IFRS 9 will remain largely similar to the categorisation under IAS 39.
The Group has also decided to exercise the accounting policy choice to continue applying hedge accounting under IAS 39, which is permitted under IFRS 9.
The Group assessed the impact on the classification and measurement with reference to the solely payments of principal and interest and concluded that the current classification under IAS 39 will remain materially unchanged.
The Group is on track to successfully deliver the changes required to adopt IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 and will not early adopt any elements of the Standard.
IFRS 16 Leases Effective from 1 January 2019, the standard replaces IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27.
It applies to all leasing arrangements.
The standard introduces a new recognition model that recognises all leases on a lessees balance sheet subject to certain exemptions, reducing off-balance sheet financing and increasing balance sheet value and operating profit.
Lessor accounting is largely unchanged.
Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied.
The Group is considering the impact on its Financial statements, although the standard is not anticipated to have a material impact as the Group is mainly a lessor of assets.
The Group is however evaluating the impact this might have on a continuing basis.
The Group intends to adopt the standard on the date it becomes effective.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Effective from 1 January 2018, the standard replaces IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRIC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18 and SIC 3.
IFRIC 18, Transfer of Assets from Customers was applied on 1 July 2009.
It applies to contracts with customers but does not apply to insurance contracts, financial instruments or lease contracts, which fall under the scope of other IFRSs.
It also does not apply if two companies in the same line of business exchange non-monetary assets to facilitate sales to other parties.
IFRS 15 introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in time or over time.
The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much, and when revenue is recognised.
This is unlikely to have a material impact on the Group due to the nature of the products and services provided to clients.
All other significant accounting policies have been discussed in the corresponding notes.
Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 125 2.
Operating segments Accounting policy The Group determines operating segments according to similar economic characteristics and the nature of its products and services in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Management reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Segment performance is evaluated based on the underlying profit or loss and is measured consistently with underlying profit or loss in the consolidated Financial statements.
Segment results are regularly reviewed and reported to the Board of Directors to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board.
The Group Executive Committee has been determined to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group.
The Group has four reportable operating segments as described below which are based on the Groups three lending divisions plus a central segment which represents the savings business, central functions and shared central costs.
These segments have changed since the 2015 Annual Report, in which the Group reported six operating segments representative of five lending divisions rather than the current three.
The reduced number of operating segments in the year is an operational change that reflects the way the business is managed and reports at a operational and oversight level.
The Commercial Mortgages and Secured Lending divisions have been amalgamated to form the Groups Property Finance division.
The Asset Finance and Business Credit divisions have been amalgamated to form the Groups Business Finance division.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments: Property Finance: Provides mortgages for investors, businesses and personal customers.
It serves professional landlords and property traders in residential and commercial asset classes across long-term and shorter-term finance.
It lends to trading businesses to fund the acquisition and refinancing of business premises.
The division serves the needs of personal customers through the provision of loans secured by second charge on the main residence and increasingly through specialist areas of first charge lending.
Business Finance: Provides the following propositions: the Regional Business Centres provide finance solutions to established businesses in UK SME markets, principally through a direct product offering.
The centres primarily provide leasing finance for business-critical assets operated by established UK SME businesses, and working capital solutions in the form of invoice discounting and asset-based lending: the Structured Finance proposition includes lending to SME finance companies with security against receivables within their portfolios.
The Structured Finance product set provides wholesale finance and block discounting to smaller UK financial institutions to allow customers to release cash and grow their businesses.
Loans are secured against receivables within the customers portfolios, with the security given by the ultimate borrower taking the form of a hard asset or a pool of loan receivables: and the Specialist Sectors proposition include leasing and hire purchase finance solutions in specialist UK SME market segments such as marine and aviation, healthcare and taxis.
We distribute the majority of our Specialist Sectors products directly through our experienced and expert teams.
Leveraging the significant lending and sector experience of our sales teams, we build and develop relationships with our clients by providing specialist insight and advice.
Consumer Lending: Provides unsecured loans for a variety of purposes, primarily focused on home improvements, holiday ownership, personal loans and certain retailers.
Central: As well as common costs, Central includes the Groups Treasury function and Consumer Savings business which are responsible for raising finance on behalf of the lending segments.

Operating segments continued Information regarding the results of each reportable segment and their reconciliation to the total results of the Group is included below.
Performance is measured based on the product contribution as included in the internal management reports.
All revenue for each operating segment is earned from external customers.
Comparative numbers are recalculated to reflect the four segments.
The underlying basis is the basis on which financial information is presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which excludes certain items included in the statutory results.

Interest and similar income Accounting policy Revenue represents income derived from loans and advances to customers, operating lease rentals and fees and commissions receivable.
Interest income and expense are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIRM.
The EIRM is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the EIR, the Group takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument, for example prepayment options, but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the EIR, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Income from finance lease and instalment credit agreements is recognised over the period of the leases so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Fees and commissions which are not considered integral to the EIR are recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided or received.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Effective interest rate IAS 39 requires interest earned from loans and advances to be measured under the EIRM.
Management must therefore use judgement to estimate the expected life of each instrument and hence the expected cash flows relating to it.
Management reviews the expected lives on a segmental basis, whereby products of a similar nature are grouped into cohorts that exhibit homogenous behavioural attributes.
The key assumptions applied by management in the EIR methodology are behavioural life of the assets and the quantum of future early settlement fee income.
The expected life behaviours are subjected to changes in internal and external factors and may result in adjustments to the carrying value of loans which must be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Management has limited historical experience of customer behaviours due to the relative immaturity of the portfolios and therefore models expected behaviour based on market trends and experience.
The actual behaviour of the portfolios are compared to the modelled behaviour on a quarterly basis and the modelled behaviours are adjusted if the modelled behaviour materially deviates from actual behaviour, with adjustments recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Management continues to perform sensitivity analyses on the EIR models applied.
A decrease in the behavioural life of a loan by 10% per calendar month would result in a net income statement decrease of 1.0 million 2015: 0.6 million.
The movement in the sensitivity can be both attributed to Property Finance and Consumer Lending.
Property Finance is expected to show an income of 0.1 million mainly due to income received from early settlement fees.
Consumer Lending is expected to show an expense of 1.1 million mainly attributable to the acceleration of the amortisation of broker fees.

Administrative expenses Accounting policy Staff costs Staff costs include salaries and social security costs and are recognised over the period in which the payments relate.
Cash bonus awards are recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the payment.
The accounting policies for employee share-based payments are set out in Note 10 Employee share-based payment transactions.
Leases If a lease agreement in which the Group is a lessee transfers the risks and rewards of the asset, the lease is recorded as a finance lease and the related asset is capitalised.
At inception, the asset is recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or fair value and is depreciated over the estimated useful life.
The lease obligations are recorded as borrowings.
If the lease does not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, the lease is recorded as an operating lease.
Operating lease payments are charged to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless a different systematic basis is more appropriate.
Where an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor in compensation is charged to profit and loss in the period in which termination is made.

Employee retirement obligations Accounting policy The Group does not operate a pension scheme.
Pension contributions are paid to staff members and Directors personal pension schemes.
The costs of the Groups contributions to defined contribution pension arrangements are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
The Group made contributions of 2.2 million 2015: 1.6 million during the year.
Employee share-based payment transactions Accounting policy Where the Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain of its employees, these are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2.
The equity is in the ordinary 0.01 shares.
The grant date fair value of a share-based payment transaction is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the equity at the date of the grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related services and nonmarket vesting conditions are expected to be met such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with market performance conditions or non-vesting conditions the grant date fair value of the award is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Taxation on the amount recognised as an expense is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Tax benefits of equity-settled share-based payment transactions that exceed the tax effected cumulative remuneration expenses are considered to relate to an equity item and are recognised directly in equity.
Expected volatility is determined by reviewing the share price volatility for the expected life of each option scheme up to the date of the grant.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Critical accounting estimates and judgements have been discussed below within the various categories of share based payments.
The employee share-based payment charge comprises: 2016 2015 m m Legacy share plan 3.4 SAYE 0.1 0.1 Performance share plan 2015 1.6 0.6 Performance share plan 2016 3.1 At 31 December 4.8 4.1 Included in the 2016 Performance Share Plan are share options related to new hires as discussed below.

Employee share-based payment transactions continued Movements in the number of share-based awards are as follows: No.
The scheme provides employees with the opportunity to take part in a tax-efficient savings scheme and to acquire Shawbrook Group plc shares at a discount to market value.
The shares subject to this option have no restrictions, save those restrictions applying as a matter of law, regulation and the Companys dealing code.
The SAYE scheme is governed by the Companys Articles of Association and is deemed by Management to be an equity-settled scheme and has been accounted for as such in the Financial statements of both the Company and its subsidiary, Shawbrook Bank Limited.
The fair value of the call options was calculated as 0.71.
The awards generally require employees to remain in employment over the vesting period but are not subject to performance conditions after the grant date.
The awards vest over a period of three years.
In October 2016 a further SAYE scheme was introduced for all employees.
The schemes terms and conditions are the same as those of the 2015 scheme.
The fair value of the call options for this scheme was calculated as 0.66.
The call options were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Employee share-based payment transactions continued Performance Share Plan PSP 2016 Tranche During the year 2,181,165 share awards were granted to a set of individuals.
These individuals are entitled to acquire ordinary shares in Shawbrook Group plc, subject to performance conditions.
The scheme is deemed to be an equity-settled scheme.
This amount included a number of options related to new hires as discussed below.
The performance conditions for the 2016 tranche relate to the growth in total shareholder return TSR over the vesting period for 20% of each award, the net-promotor score NPS at the date of vesting for 20% of each award, the risk performance over the vesting period for 20% of each award and the annual compound growth in the earnings per share EPS over the vesting period for 40% of each award.
The outcome of the performance conditions, as assessed by the Remuneration Committee, will determine the vesting outcome of the awards and the shares available for exercise.
The performance condition relating to the TSR element is measured in relation to the ranking of the Groups TSR within a comparator group of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee.
The fair value of the shares in the EPS, NPS and risk performance elements of the awards is based on the share price at the date of the grant discounted for any expected dividends over the vesting period.
The dividend-adjusted fair value of these awards is 2.63.
The fair value of the shares in the TSR award is calculated using a Monte Carlo model with 100,000 simulations.
Set out below is a summary of the key data and assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the TSR award: Assumptions Share price at grant date 2.87 Volatility 30% p. a.

The fair value of the shares in the TSR award is 1.46.
Performance Share Plan PSP 2015 Tranche During 2015 a number of share awards were granted to a set of individuals other than Directors.
The individuals are entitled to receive an award to acquire a specific number of ordinary shares in Shawbrook Group plc, subject to performance conditions.
The scheme is deemed to be an equity-settled scheme and has been accounted for as such in the Financial statements of both the Company and its subsidiary, Shawbrook Bank Limited.
The share awards are subject to performance conditions, namely the Group earning a defined underlying profit before tax in 2017, and subject to the Group maintaining its threshold capital and liquidity requirements.
The fair value of the shares is based on the share price at the dates of the grant discounted for any expected dividends over the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued is 3.25.
New hires 2016 During the year a number of senior hires were, under the terms of their employment with the Group, granted options over shares of 0.01 in the Company, in accordance with the Shawbrook Performance Share Plan in order to compensate them for forfeited awards from previous employment.
A total of 897,403 options have been granted that vest over the following two years.

Taxation Accounting policy Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on an aggregation of a rate of 18% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and the additional 8% of tax suffered in relation to the banking surcharge that will unwind over the remaining life of the underlying assets with which they are associated.
Loans and advances to customers Accounting policy Loans and advances The Groups loans and advances to banks and customers are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, whose recoverability is based solely on the credit risk of the customer and where the Group has no intention of trading the loan or receivable.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
Subsequent recognition is at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment.
Assets acquired in exchange for loans Included within loans and advances to customers are assets acquired in exchange for loans, instalment credit and finance lease receivables as part of an orderly realisation.
The asset acquired is recorded at the lower of its fair value less costs to sell and the carrying amount of the lease net of impairment allowance at the date of exchange.
Any subsequent write-down of the acquired asset to fair value less costs to sell is recognised in the income statement.
Any subsequent increase in the fair value less costs to sell, to the extent this does not exceed the cumulative write-down, is also recognised in the income statement, together with any realised gains or losses on disposal.

Impairment provisions on loans and advances to customers Accounting policy On an on-going basis the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of impairment loss include, but are not limited to, the following: delinquency in contractual payments of principal or interest: cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower: initiation of bankruptcy proceedings: the customer being granted a concession that would otherwise not be considered: and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the portfolio.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on an individual financial asset has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Objective evidence of impairment of a portfolio of receivables exists if objective data indicates a decrease in expected future cash flows from a collection of receivables and the decrease can be measured reliably but cannot be identified with the individual receivables in the portfolio in which case a collective provision is applied.
When a loan or receivable is not economic to recover, it is written off against the related provision for loan impairments.
Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised directly in the income statement through the impairment line as post write-off recoveries.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the customers credit rating, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the impairment allowance.
The amount of reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group operates a forbearance policy in situations where it becomes aware that an individual customer is experiencing financial hardship.
Repayment options are discussed with the customer that are appropriate to the customers specific situation.
The Group seeks to ensure that any forbearance results in a fair customer outcome and will not repossess an asset unless all other reasonable attempts to resolve the position have failed.

Impairment provisions on loans and advances to customers continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements Individual impairment losses on loans and advances are calculated based on an assessment of the expected cash flows and the underlying collateral.
For individual provision, statistical models are used for consumer and second-charge loans, whilst provisions for first-charge loans, asset finance and business finance are assessed on a loan-by-loan basis.
Where models are used for individual provisions, score cards are used to calculate probability of default PDs based on the recent performance of the portfolios.
Loss given defaults LGDs are calculated taking into account the valuations of available collateral, and the experienced forced sale discounts when collateral has been realised.
These factors are applied to all the aged portfolios of debt at each balance sheet date to derive the individual impairment requirement.
For the purpose of collective impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics.
For some portfolios the collective impairment requirement is based on the forecast cost of risk, being the annualised percentage loss per monetary unit of loan across the loan portfolios.
These loss rates are multiplied by emergence periods, currently six months for all portfolios 2015: six months, for each class of loan to calculate the amount of loss which is incurred at the balance sheet date but not yet individually identified.
The key assumptions, being the emergence periods, forced-sale discount FSD on the residential portfolio, cost of risk and PD of the residential and consumer portfolios, are monitored regularly to ensure the impairment allowance is entirely reflective of the current portfolio.
The accuracy of the impairment calculation would therefore be affected by unanticipated changes to the economic situation and assumptions which differ from actual outcomes.
For example, for loans and advances: change of one month in the emergence period across all portfolios, would change the collective provision by 0.9 million 2015: 0.5 million : a change in the cost of risk rate of 10 basis points, would change the collective provision by 1.7 million 2015: 1.5 million : an increase in the forced sale discount on the residential portfolio of 5%, would increase the individual provisions by 0.5 million 2015: 0.4 million : and an increase in the PD on the residential and consumer portfolios of 10%, would increase the individual provisions by 1.1 million 2015: 1.0 million.
The movement in the allowances for losses in respect of loans, finance leases and instalment credit agreements during the year was as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 13.5 11.1 Charge for impairment losses 24.3 6.5 Provisions utilised 13.4 4.1 At 31 December 24.4 13.5 Analysis of impairment type Loan receivables 13.6 10.5 Finance lease receivables 8.5 2.0 Instalment credit receivables 2.3 1.0 At 31 December 24.4 13.5 A controls breach was identified in the Business Finance Division in H1 2016 following a significant investment in the Risk Management Framework during 2015 and 2016.
The upgraded quality assurance procedures detected a portfolio of facilities that did not meet the Groups strict lending criteria.
This has resulted in an impairment charge of 11.2 million and associated administrative expenses of 0.8 million in 2016.

Derivative financial instruments Accounting policy Derivatives and hedge accounting The Groups derivative activities are entered into for the purposes of matching or eliminating risk from potential movements in interest rates in the Groups assets and liabilities.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risks.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets and, where these are not available, from valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models at a benchmark interest rate, typically LIBOR or its equivalent and option pricing models.
Derivatives are measured as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative.
The Group has adopted hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 which specifies that the hedge relationship must be clearly documented at inception and the derivative must be expected to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk.
Effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
The Group does not apply a credit valuation adjustment CVA or debit valuation adjustment DVA as the Groups portfolio is fully collateralised.
The Group does not apply funding fair value adjustment FFVA to its derivative exposures as it deems the adjustment to be immaterial.
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies: consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
The Group uses derivatives to reduce exposure to market risks, and not for trading purposes.
The Group uses the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA Master Agreement to document these transactions in conjunction with a Credit Support Annex CSA.
The fair value of derivatives is set out below: Notional Fair amount value m m Interest rate swaps: Assets 485.0 5.2 Liabilities 39.0 0.4 Foreign exchange swaps: Liabilities 16.4 At 31 December 2016 540.4 4.8 Interest rate swaps: Assets 535.0 2.8 At 31 December 2015 535.0 2.8 Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 141 15.
Derivative financial instruments continued Gains and losses from derivatives and hedge accounting are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Fair value gain loss on financial instruments 2.0 0.9 Fair value loss gain on hedged risk 1.5 0.6 Fair value gain loss on financial instruments 0.5 0.3 It is the Groups policy to enter into master netting and margining agreements with all derivative counterparties.
In general, under master netting agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty that are due on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount payable by one party to the other and the agreements terminated.
Under margining agreements where the Group has a net asset position valued at current market values, in respect of its derivatives with a counterparty, then that counterparty will place collateral, usually cash, with the Group in order to cover the position.
Similarly, the Group will place collateral, usually cash, with the counterparty where it has a net liability position.
The table below illustrates the amounts that are covered by enforceable netting arrangements i. e. offsetting agreements and any related financial collateral.
The table excludes financial instruments not subject to offset and those that are subject to collateral arrangements only e. g. loans and advances.

Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies Operating leases Included within property, plant and equipment are assets leased to customers under operating leases.
The net book value of operating leases represents the original cost of the equipment less cumulative depreciation.
Rentals are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis to a residual value over the life of the associated agreement.
Depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of plant and equipment as follows: office equipment 3 5 years fixtures and fittings 5 years motor vehicles 4 years freehold property 50 years leasehold costs life of the lease 1 operating leases life of the lease 1 Operating leases are assets leased to customers.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Assets acquired in exchange for operating leases Included within property, plant and equipment are assets acquired in exchange for operating leases as part of an orderly realisation.
No depreciation is charged in respect of assets held for sale.
Any subsequent increase in the fair value less costs to sell, to the extent it does not exceed the cumulative write down, is also recognised in the income statement, together with any realised gains or losses on disposal.
Residual values The residual values of assets under operating leases are reviewed by Management for impairment, taking into account the nature and condition of the assets.
Where the residual value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are impaired and the impairment charged to the profit and loss account.

Intangible assets Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill may arise on the acquisition of companies whose businesses become integrated within the Group and reflects the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of net assets acquired.
Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment by reviewing detailed cash flow projections from the Groups latest approved forecast.
Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the greater of its value-in-use and its fair value less costs to sell.
The estimation of recoverable value is based on value in use calculations incorporating forecasts by Management of post-tax profits for the subsequent five years, and a residual value, discounted at a risk-adjusted interest rate appropriate to the CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its recoverable amount.
No impairment losses were recognised during 2016 2015: nil.
Computer software Expenditure on software development activities is capitalised if the following conditions are met: the product or process is technically and commercially feasible: the Group intends to, and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to, complete development: future economic benefits are probable: and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of direct labour and software licence costs.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised developments are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis through administrative expenses over the estimated useful life of the asset according to the following timescales: computer software and licences 3 7 years Critical accounting estimates and judgements The review of goodwill for impairment reflects Managements best estimate of future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both which are subject to uncertainty as follows: the future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to projected cash flows based on the forecasts and assumptions regarding the projected periods and the long-term pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter.
the rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their valuations and are based on the capital asset pricing model CAPM, which incorporates inputs reflecting a number of variables.
These variables are subject to fluctuations beyond Managements control, are also subject to uncertainty and require the exercise of significant judgement.

Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Groups CGUs as follows: 2016 2015 m m Property Finance 9.0 9.0 Business Finance 34.7 34.7 Consumer Lending 1.1 1.1 At 31 December 44.8 44.8 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been calculated based on their value in use VIU, determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated from the continuing use of the CGUs.
No impairment losses were recognised in 2016 2015: nil because the recoverable amounts of the CGUs were determined to be higher than their carrying values.
The key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use were as follows: Post-tax discount rate Property Finance 12.22% Business Finance 13.40% Consumer Lending 13.99% Terminal value growth rate 2.0% Cash flow period years 5 Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 146 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 17.
Intangible assets continued Following the consolidation of the business units, the goodwill has been re-allocated to three CGUs, namely Property Finance, Business Finance and Consumer Lending.
The CGUs have been identified at what management believe to be smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use and that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other groups.
Goodwill was allocated to the CGUs following an allocation and impairment review performed prior to the interim 2016 reporting.
Prior to allocation a final goodwill impairment test was performed as at 30 June 2016 which concluded that no impairment was needed.
Impairment testing has been performed based on a discounted free cash flow model in line with the accounting policy and no impairment losses were recognised because the recoverable amounts of the CGUs were determined to be higher than the carrying values.
Discount rate: The discount rate is an estimate of the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive from the asset, which is derived using CAPM.
The CAPM depends on inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk in the business being evaluated.
These variables are based on the markets assessment of the economic variables and Managements judgement.
For the 31 December 2016 test, the methodology used to determine the discount rate for the business was refined to more accurately reflect the risk profile of the Group.
In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, Management supplements this process by comparing the discount rate derived using the internally generated CAPM with costs of capital rates produced by external sources.
Terminal value growth rate: The terminal value growth rate is an estimate of the rate of growth of future cash flows beyond the cash flow period of five years.
The rate is estimated by Management, taking into account rates disclosed by comparable institutions.
Managements judgement in estimating the cash flows of CGUs: Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model, which is based on a Board approved plan.
A long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the long term compound annual profit before tax growth rate estimated by Management.
The dividend discount model DDM is used to calculate the recoverable amount of future cash flows.
The DDM discounts future cash flows post-tax profits generated by the CGUs, however the cash flows are reduced by any earnings retained to support the growth in the underlying CGUs loan books through higher regulatory capital requirements.
Forecasted post-tax profits were based on expectations of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated revenue growth.
The key assumptions described above may change as economic and market conditions change.
The Group has assessed the sensitivity of the discount rate and identified that an increase of 3.00% in each of the individual CGU discount rates will not result in any impairment of the goodwill balance.

Deferred tax Accounting policy Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets are attributable as follows: 2016 2015 m m Accelerated tax depreciation 14.9 13.5 Deferred tax on acquisition adjustments 0.1 Share Based Payments 1.1 0.1 Bad debt provision 1.8 0.5 Other 0.1 0.1 Deferred tax asset 17.9 14.1 At 1 January 14.1 9.8 Current period movement recognised in income 1.8 0.3 Prior year adjustment 0.2 0.4 Share Based Payments 0.9 0.1 Bad debt provision 1.3 0.3 Effect of tax rate changes 3.2 At 31 December 17.9 14.1 The Group had a deferred tax asset of 17.9 million at 31 December 2016 2015: 14.1 million resulting primarily from decelerated capital allowances.
The business plan projects profits in future years sufficient to recognise the 17.9 million deferred tax asset.
The tax assets will unwind over the remaining life of the underlying leased assets with which they are associated.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.

The FSCS levy consists of two parts: a management expenses levy and a compensation levy.
The management expenses levy covers the costs of running the scheme and the compensation levy covers the amount of compensation the scheme pays, net of any recoveries it makes using the rights that have been assigned to it.
The FSCS meets these current claims by way of loans received from HM Treasury.
The terms of these loans were interest only for the first three years, and the FSCS seeks to recover the interest cost, together with on-going management expenses, via annual management levies on members, including the Group, over this period.
The Groups FSCS provision reflects market participation up to the reporting date.
The above provision includes the estimated management expense levy for the scheme year 2015 16.
This amount was calculated on the basis of the Groups current share of protected deposits taking into account the FSCSs estimate of total management expense levies for the scheme year.
In addition to the management levies, the FSCS commenced charging for compensation levies over a number of scheme years commencing 1 April 2012 and an instalment of this was paid during the year.
No provision in respect of the capital compensation levy is included in the provision at 31 December 2016.

Operating leases Accounting policy Operating lease income is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term unless a different systematic basis is more appropriate.
Where an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor in compensation is charged to profit or loss in the period in which termination is made.
Leases as lessee Non-cancellable operating lease rentals on land and buildings are payable as follows: 2016 2015 m m Less than 1 year 1.5 1.0 Between 1 and 5 years 3.4 3.6 4.9 4.6 Leases as lessor Operating lease rentals receivable from agreements classified as property, plant and equipment, as disclosed in Note 16, are receivable as follows: 2016 2015 m m Less than 1 year 10.4 12.4 Between 1 and 5 years 16.0 18.3 More than 5 years 1.0 1.1 27.4 31.8 Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 151 26.
Subordinated debt Accounting policy The subordinated debt is a non-derivative financial liability with fixed or determinable payments.
The subordinated debt is recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Interest costs arising are capitalised in accordance with agreed terms and incorporated into the total debt payable and recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
Subordinated debt liability: In 2015, the Group issued 75 million fixed rate reset callable subordinated notes due 2025 with an initial semi-annual coupon of 8.5%, which was listed for trading on the London Stock Exchange on 28 October 2015.
Fees of 1 million were incurred on issuance.
On the same date, the subordinated debt dated 31 October 2013 was cancelled and repaid.

The subordinated debt ranks behind any claims against the Group from all depositors and creditors.
Share capital On 31 March 2015, the Company underwent a capital restructuring prior to its Admission to the London Stock Exchange.
This resulted in the conversion of certain A, B and C ordinary shares into deferred shares with the remaining shares being converted into ordinary shares of 1 each.
Each ordinary share of 1 was then subdivided into 100 ordinary shares.
The deferred shares were repurchased by the Company and cancelled, generating a capital redemption reserve of 183,067,856.
On 8 April 2015, upon Admission to the London Stock Exchange, the Company issued 31,034,483 0.01 shares for consideration of 90,000,000.
This generated a share premium of 89,689,655.
A further 500,000 0.01 ordinary shares were issued under a block listing in December 2015.
The market value of shares issued on 8 April 2015 was 2.90 per share.

Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 153 29.
Financial instruments Accounting policies Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss: and loan receivables.
The Groups financial liabilities are designated as other financial liabilities at amortised cost and at fair value through profit or loss.
A financial asset is measured initially at fair value plus the transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition.
A financial liability is measured initially at fair value less the transaction costs that are directly attributable to its issue.
Derivative financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group has not classified any assets or liabilities as held to maturity or as available for sale.
Loan receivables Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Loans and advances to banks and building societies are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and advances to customers include finance leases and instalment credit advances.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
The net investment in finance leases and instalment credit agreements represents the future lease rentals and instalments receivable less profit and costs allocated to future periods.
Income is recognised throughout the life of the agreement to provide a constant rate of return on the net investment in each lease or instalment credit agreement.
Where an agreement is classified as an operating lease at inception, but is subsequently reclassified as a finance lease following a change to the agreement or an extension beyond the primary term, then the agreement is accounted for as a finance lease.
Financial liabilities Customer deposits and amounts due to banks are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments.
Deposits and amounts due to banks are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Derecognition is the point at which an asset or liability is removed from the balance sheet.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or when all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled, or expired.
If the terms of the financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised.
If the net present value of the cash flows from the original financial asset is substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired.
In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and the new financial asset is recognised at fair value.
The impairment loss before an unexpected restructuring is measured as follows: if the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the estimated cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in the measurement of the existing asset based on their expected timing and amounts discounted at the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset: and if the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition.
This amount is then discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.
Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 154 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 29.
Financial instruments continued The Group determines fair value using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making measurements: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations.
The Group uses widely recognised valuation models for determining the fair value of common and simpler financial instruments, such as interest rate and currency swaps that use only observable market data and require little Management judgement and estimation.
Observable prices and model inputs are usually available in the market for simple over the counter derivatives like interest rate swaps.
Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for Management judgement and estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with the determination of fair values.
Availability of observable market prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
The consideration of factors such as the scale and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads assists in the assessment of whether a market is active.
If, in the opinion of Management, a significant proportion of an instruments carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs, the instrument in its entirety is classified as valued at Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the level at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value consensus pricing data may, for example, be used.
Cash and balances with central banks Fair value approximates to carrying value as cash and balances at central banks have minimal credit losses and are either short-term in nature or re-price frequently.
Loans and advances to banks, customer deposits, amounts due to banks and derivatives Fair value is estimated by using discounted cash flows applying either market rates where practicable or rates offered with similar characteristics by other financial institutions.
The fair value of floating rate placements, fixed rate placements with less than six months to maturity and overnight deposits is considered to approximate to their carrying amount.
Fair values of derivatives are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets and, where these are not available, from valuation techniques including discounted cash flows.
Loans and advances to customers Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date, and adjusted for future credit losses if considered material.
Subordinated debt Fair values are based on quoted prices where available or by discounting cash flows using market rates.

Risk management The main areas of risk that the business is exposed to are: credit risk: liquidity risk: market risk: capital risk and management: operational risk: and conduct risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss should borrowers or counterparties default on their contractual obligations to the Group.
These risks are managed by the Board Risk Committee and the Asset and Liability Committee.
This risk has two main components: customer risk individual and business lending : and treasury risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of its financial assets, without taking account of any underlying collateral, and contractual commitments, which represent agreements entered into but not advanced as at 31 December 2016.

Collateral held in relation to secured loans is capped at the amount outstanding on an individual loan basis.
Shawbrook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 158 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 30.
Risk management continued Credit quality of assets Loans and receivables The Group defines three classifications of credit quality low risk, medium risk and higher risk for all credit exposures.
These are based on the following criteria: Property Finance: For the residential mortgage portfolio a risk rating scale is applied to the individual loans and weighs the propensity of non-performance and write-offs.
The provisioning methodology within the residential portfolio was amended during the year to utilise credit scoring to drive loan level probability of defaults.
The combined propensity scores are scaled into low risk, medium risk and higher risk.
In the Commercial Mortgages portfolio loans are classified as low risk, medium risk and high risk on a case by case basis based on the circumstances of every case.
Business Finance: Loans are classified as low risk, medium risk and higher risk on a case by case basis.
Classification is based on managements review of the individual circumstances of every case.
Consumer Lending: Any loans that are 90 days or more past due are deemed to be impaired.
Loans that are neither past due nor impaired are considered by management to be low risk.
The credit quality of assets that are neither past due nor impaired are as follows: Property Finance Business Finance Consumer Lending Total As at 31 December 2016 m % m % m % m % Low risk 2,397.5 98.1 986.5 95.1 460.8 100.0 3,844.8 97.5 Medium risk 38.5 1.6 50.3 4.9 88.8 2.3 Higher risk 7.9 0.3 0.1 8.0 0.2 Total neither past due nor impaired 2,443.9 100.0 1,036.9 100.0 460.8 100.0 3,941.6 100.0 Property Finance Business Finance Consumer Lending Total As at 31 December 2015 m % m % m % m % Low risk 2,048.6 99.7 853.2 97.7 331.8 100.0 3,233.6 99.2 Medium risk 0.9 11.0 1.2 11.9 0.3 Higher risk 5.7 0.3 9.5 1.1 15.2 0.5 Total neither past due nor impaired 2,055.2 100.0 873.7 100.0 331.8 100.0 3,260.7 100.0 Customer risk The Group maintains a forbearance policy for the servicing and management of customers who are in financial difficulty and require some form of concession to be granted, even if this concession entails a loss for the Group.
A concession may be either of the following: a modification of the previous terms and conditions of an agreement, which the borrower is considered unable to comply with due to its financial difficulties, to allow for sufficient debt service ability, that would not have been granted had the borrower not been in financial difficulties: or a total or partial refinancing of an agreement that would not have been granted had the borrower not been in financial difficulties.
Forbearance in relation to an exposure can be temporary or permanent depending on the circumstances, progress on financial rehabilitation and the detail of the concession s agreed.
A forbearance classification can be discontinued when all of the following conditions have been met: the exposure is considered as performing, including, if it has been reclassified from the non-performing category, after an analysis of the financial condition of the borrower shows it no longer meets the conditions to be considered as non-performing: regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period: and none of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past-due at the end of the probation period.

The total carrying value of these assets was 2.1 million.
Of the six repossessions, five were disposed of by December 2016 and the sixth in January 2017.
Loans and advances to customers are reviewed regularly to determine whether there is any objective evidence of impairment and assets are categorised as detailed in the tables below: Type of impairment assessment Description Individual impairment Where specific circumstances indicate that a loss is likely to be incurred.
Collective impairment Impairment allowances are calculated for each portfolio on a collective basis, given the homogenous nature of the assets in the portfolio.
Risk categorisation Description Neither past due nor impaired Loans that are not in arrears and which do not meet the impaired asset definition.
This segment can include assets subject to forbearance solutions.
Past due but not impaired Loans past due but not impaired consist predominantly of Loans in Property Finance and Business Finance that are past due and individually assessed as not being impaired.
This definition also includes Unsecured loans in the Consumer division that are past due but not more than 90 days.
Impaired assets Loans that are in arrears or where there is objective evidence of impairment and where the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the expected recoverable amount.
This definition also includes unsecured loans in the Consumer division that are more than 90 days in arrears and carry identified impairment.

Risk management continued The Group only lends to UK high-street banks.
Deposits are placed either overnight or for a short term with a duration of less than three months.
No collateral or other credit enhancements are held against loans and advances to banks.
The Groups exposure to the Bank of England is set out below: 2016 2015 Loans and advances to central banks m m Aa1 429.9 521.9 Credit risk derived from derivative transactions is mitigated by collateralising the exposures.
Such collateral is subject to the standard industry CSA and is paid or received on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2016, cash collateral of 4.8 million had been received by the Group 2015: 3.7 million.
Liquidity risk Accounting policy Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its current and future financial obligations as they fall due, or is only able to do so at excessive cost.
The Group has, therefore, developed comprehensive funding and liquidity policies to ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid assets to be able to meet all its financial obligations and maintain public confidence.
The Groups Treasury function is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Groups liquidity and wholesale funding.
The Board sets limits over the level, composition, and maturity of liquidity and deposit funding balances, reviewing these at least annually.
Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by Finance and Risk function personnel independent of the Treasury function.
Additionally, a combined liquidity stress test is performed daily and a series of other liquidity stress tests are performed monthly by the Risk function and formally reported to ALCo and the Board to ensure that the Group maintains adequate liquidity for business purposes even under stressed conditions.
The Group reports its liquidity position against its liquidity coverage ratio, net stable funding ratio and other key regulatory ratios for regulatory purposes Funding for Lending Scheme FLS The Group is a participant in the FLS which enables it to borrow highly liquid UK Treasury bills in exchange for eligible collateral.
The Treasury bills issued are for an original maturity of nine months and if delivered back prior to their maturity date can be exchanged for further nine month Bills.
Costs of borrowing are charged directly to the income statement.
The Treasury bills are not recorded on the Groups balance sheet as ownership remains with the Bank of England.
The risks and rewards of the collateral provided remains with the Group and continue to be recognised in the Groups Financial statements.
Term Funding Scheme TFS The Term Funding Scheme TFS was announced by the Bank of England on 4 August 2016 and became effective from 19 September 2016.
The TFS is designed to reinforce the transmission of reductions in the Bank of Englands official interest rate Bank Rate to those interest rates actually faced by households and businesses by providing term funding to banks at rates close to Bank Rate.
It is a monetary policy tool of the Monetary Policy Committee and will be operated as part of the Asset Purchase Facility.
The TFS allows participants to borrow central bank reserves in exchange for eligible collateral.
The Group had drawn 118 million as at 31 December 2016 which is recorded on the balance sheet.

The average liquidity reserve throughout the year was 745.1 million 2015: 510.0 million.
Asset encumbrance The Groups assets can be used to support collateral requirements for central bank operations or third party repurchase transactions.
Assets that have been set aside for such purposes are classified as encumbered assets and cannot be used for other purposes.
All other assets are defined as unencumbered assets.
These comprise assets that are readily available to secure funding or meet collateral requirements, and assets that are not subject to any restrictions but are not readily available for use.

A comprehensive stress testing exercise is conducted at least annually and the methodology is incorporated into the Groups balance sheet risk management model to ensure that stress tests are run on a regular basis.
The output of stress testing is circulated to the Board and to the Asset and Liability Committee ALCo who use the results to decide whether to amend the Groups risk appetite and liquidity limits.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the value of, or income arising from, the Groups assets and liabilities change as a result of changes in market prices, the principal element being interest rate risk.
Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures while maintaining a market profile consistent with our risk appetite.
The Groups Treasury function is responsible for managing the Groups exposure to all aspects of market risk within the operational limits set out in the Groups treasury policies.
The ALCo approves the Groups treasury policies and receives regular reports on all aspects of market risk exposure, including interest rate risk.
The Group has minimal foreign currency exposure and does not engage in any treasury trading operations.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk arises from the loan and savings products that we offer.
This risk is managed through the use of appropriate financial instruments, including derivatives, with established risk limits, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures.
Basis risk Basis risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in the relationship between interest rates which have similar but not identical characteristics for example, LIBOR and the Bank of England base rate.
This is monitored closely and regularly reported to the ALCo.
This risk is managed by matching and where appropriate and necessary, through the use of derivatives, with established risk limits and other control procedures.
The Groups forecasts and plans take account of the risk of interest rate changes and are prepared and stressed accordingly, in line with PRA guidance.

Risk management continued Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the value of, or net income arising from, assets and liabilities changes as a result of movements in exchange rates.
The Group has low levels of foreign exchange risk which is managed by natural hedging and appropriate financial instruments including derivatives.
The table below sets out the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk: US Australian Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at Sterling carrying values Euros Dollars Dollars 2016 m m m Loans and advances to banks 0.4 0.9 Loans and advances to customers 12.9 6.6 Net position 13.3 5.7 US Australian Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at Sterling carrying values Euros Dollars Dollars 2015 m m m Loans and advances to banks 3.7 1.6 0.1 Loans and advances to customers 8.1 6.8 Amounts due to banks 8.1 3.4 Net position 3.7 1.8 0.1 Foreign exchange sensitivity The Group estimates that a 5% movement in exchange rates would have no greater impact on the 2016 profit than an increase or decrease of 1.0 million.
Interest rate sensitivity gap The Group considers a parallel 200 basis points bps movement to be appropriate for scenario testing given the current economic outlook and industry expectations.
The Group estimates that a - 200 bps movement in interest rates paid received would have impacted the economic value of equity as follows: 200 bps 9.5 million positive 2015: 8.0 million positive -200 bps 12.1 million positive 2015: 24.5 million positive In addition, the effect of the same two interest rate shocks are applied to the balance sheet at year-end, to determine how net interest income may change on an annualised basis for one year, as follows: 200 bps 20.0 million positive 2015: 19.9 million positive -200 bps 1.9 million positive 2015: 1.4 million positive In preparing the sensitivity analyses above, the Group makes certain assumptions consistent with expected and contractual re-pricing behaviour as well as behavioural repayment profiles, under the two interest scenarios, of the underlying balance sheet items.
The results also include the impact of hedge transactions.

Risk management continued Regulation unaudited CRD IV requires the Group to hold Common Equity Tier 1 capital to account for capital conservation, countercyclical and systemic risk buffers.
A capital conservation buffer of 0.625% was introduced on 1 January 2016 and will increase each year to 2019 in line with regulations.
CRD IV also introduced a new leverage ratio requirement.
The leverage calculation determines a ratio based on the relationship between Tier 1 capital and total consolidated exposure, being the sum of on-balance sheet exposures, derivative exposures, securities financing transaction exposures and off-balance sheet exposures.
This leverage ratio is a risk-based measure that is designed to act as a supplement to risk based capital requirements.
Minimum Requirements for Eligible Liabilities MREL are applicable from 1 January 2016 and will be phased in fully by 1 January 2020.
Prior to 31 December 2019, MREL will be equal to an institutions minimum regulatory capital requirements.
The Bank of England has provided MREL guidance to the Group, as well as guidance on the transitional arrangements until 1 January 2020.
Policies and processes for managing the Groups capital unaudited The Groups approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
The Groups principal objectives when managing capital are to: address the expectation of the shareholders and optimise business activities to ensure return on capital targets are achieved though efficient capital management: ensure that the Group and Bank hold sufficient risk capital.
Risk capital caters for unexpected losses that may arise, protects shareholders and depositors and thereby supports the sustainability of the Bank through the business cycles: and comply with capital supervisory requirements and related regulations.
The Prudential Regulation Authority PRA supervises the Group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the Group as a whole.
In addition, a number of subsidiaries are regulated for prudential purposes by either the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system and embed the requirements of Pillar 3 on market discipline.
Under Pillar 2, the Group completes an annual self-assessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP is reviewed by the PRA which culminates in the PRA setting Individual Capital Guidance ICG on the level of capital the Group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The Groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the Groups website.
The Group maintains a strong capital base with the aim of supporting the development of the business and to ensure it meets the Pillar 1 capital requirements and ICG at all times.
As a result, the Group maintains capital adequacy ratios above minimum regulatory requirements.
The Groups individual regulated entities complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 2016 and 2015.

Contingent liabilities and guarantees Accounting policies Financial guarantee contracts Liabilities under financial guarantee contracts which are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, which is generally the fee received or the present value of the fee receivable.
Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the initial fair value, less cumulative amortisation, and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities, which includes contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings or regulatory matters, are possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of Shawbrook Group plc: alternatively they are present obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic benefits, or because the amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote.
Financial guarantee contracts In 2015, the Group entered into a financial guarantee contract to an amount of 2.5 million.
This contract is a continuous obligation which may be terminated by the Group on giving three months written notice.
The contract is fully collateralised through a first fixed charge over a blocked deposit account to an amount of 2.5 million.
