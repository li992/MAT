The tax credit on the Groups loss before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the statutory tax rate applicable to the losses of the consolidated entities as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Loss before tax 17,198 56,797 Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK 20% 3,440 11,359 Tax effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes Listing fees 368 296 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes other 3,833 453 Adjustment in respect of prior years 926 Change in tax rates on the net deferred tax asset 280 3,010 Total tax credit 445 7,600 The Finance Bill 2016 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2015.
The Act reduced the main rate of Corporation Tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.
This supersedes the 18% rate effective in the Finance No.
In the 2016 Budget the Chancellor announced from 1 April 2017 there will be a new restriction on the amount of profit that can be offset by brought forward losses.
The use of brought forward losses against current year profits will be subject to an annual allowance of 5 million per group and above this allowance there will be a 50% restriction in the profits that can be covered by losses brought forward.
This planned legislation has not yet been substantively enacted and therefore does not impact Metro Bank at the balance sheet date.

Taxation continued Deferred tax A deferred tax asset must be regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable tax profits from which the future of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
There is no time limit on the recovery of the deferred tax asset.
Further information on the details of the judgements taken around deferred tax are discussed in note 1.
