144 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION c Impairment testing An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
Consistent with previous years, all goodwill, together with CGUs where there were indicators of impairment, was tested for impairment.
An impairment charge of 52 million 2015: 71 million has been recorded in the Income Statement as an adjusting and non-trading item within the line impairment charges in respect of three CGUs: two in GKN Aerospace and one in GKN Land Systems.
An impairment charge in Engine Products West, North America GKN Aerospace of 29 million follows loss of key business during the year.
The charge comprises goodwill only.
The remaining recoverable amount of 161 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 13% 2015: 12%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 9 million.
An impairment charge in Engine Products East, North America GKN Aerospace of 18 million follows a market change in demand for the electrochemical machining technology offered by this business.
The charge comprises goodwill of 7 million and property, plant and equipment of 11 million.
The remaining recoverable amount of 51 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 13% 2015: 12%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 5% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 3 million.
An impairment charge in Wheels China GKN Land Systems of 5 million following a significant period of market decline and loss of future orders.
The charge comprises goodwill of 2 million and property, plant and equipment of 3 million.
The remaining recoverable amount of 19 million represents its value in use, using a discount rate of 14% 2015: 13%.
The impairment charge is most sensitive to operating cash flows and a 1% change in this assumption would have impacted the impairment charge by 3 million.
Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates All CGUs recoverable amounts were measured using value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years in Automotive and GKN Land Systems CGUs, and ten years in GKN Aerospace have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
Operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years are used in GKN Aerospace as they incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of those CGUs programmes.
Assumptions and estimates In determining the value in use of CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry-relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Automotive businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain military and commercial programmes within GKN Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of maintaining capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based on long-term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates or is exposed.
A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long-term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five-year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based or has exposure.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates: GKN Aerospace: UK 3% 2015: 3%, Europe 3% 2015: 2% and North America 3% 2015: 3%.
GKN Driveline: North and South America 3%-5% 2015: 3%-6%, Europe 2%-4% 2015: 2%-4% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 2%-9% 2015: 2%-10%.
GKN Powder Metallurgy: Europe 3% 2015: 2% and North America 3% 2015: 3%.
