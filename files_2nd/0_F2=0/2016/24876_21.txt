At 31 December 2015 the Group had purchased 86,732 of its own shares, which were held in an employee benefit trust for the purposes of settling awards granted to employees under equity-settled share based payment plans.
The cost of these shares, amounting to 0.5m, was included within retained earnings at that date.
In March 2016, these shares were issued in settlement of awards to employees together with an additional 11,754 shares purchased in 2016.
A further 103,246 shares were purchased in 2016 at a cost of 1.1m and are held at 31 December 2016. www.

com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 97 Group Accounting Policies Hill & Smith Holdings PLC is a company incorporated in the UK.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 101: these are presented on pages 137 to 148.
The Accounting Policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently in all periods presented in these Group Financial Statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these Accounting Policies that have a significant effect on the Group Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 24.
Going concern and liquidity risk The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 15 to 26.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report on pages 22 to 26.
In addition, note 20 to the Group Financial Statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The businesses of the Group have long established relationships with customers and suppliers which, together with the Groups current financial strength, provide a solid foundation.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current bank facilities, of which the Groups principal debt facility is a multi-currency agreement with a value of 232.3m at 31 December 2016, expiring in April 2021.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
New IFRS standards and interpretations adopted during 2016 In 2016 the following amendments had been endorsed by the EU, became effective and therefore were adopted by the Group: Amendments to IFRS 11 - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation.
Amendments to IAS 27 - Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle.
Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 1.
The adoption of these standards and amendments has not had a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
The following standards and interpretations which are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group will be adopted in future accounting periods: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018.
The impact of IFRS 16, which was issued in January 2016, is currently being assessed.
None of the other standards or amendments above are expected to have a material impact on the Group.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 98 Group Accounting Policies continued Measurement convention The Group Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except where the measurement of balances at fair value is required as explained below.
Intangible assets IFRS3 was revised in 2010 such that acquisition costs cannot be capitalised for investments made on or after 1 January 2010.
Acquisitions prior to this date have had these costs included with the purchase consideration and as such the goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries comprises the excess of this fair value of the purchase consideration over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
On an ongoing basis the goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment of assets.
Fair value adjustments are always considered to be provisional at the first year end date after the acquisition to allow the maximum time to elapse for management to make a reliable estimate.
Goodwill prior to 1 October 1998 was written off to reserves.
Goodwill from 1 October 1998 to 31 December 2003 was amortised in line with UK GAAP.
From 1 January 2004 this goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Brands and customer lists that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment of assets.
Cost reflects managements judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Certain US brands are considered to have an indefinite life and therefore are subject to annual impairment testing see accounting policy Impairment of assets.
For other brands and customer lists, amortisation is provided equally over the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned, currently up to 20 years.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is considered to be technically and commercially viable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is provided equally over the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned, currently up to seven years.
Trade licences are amortised over the specific term granted to each individual licence.
Property, plant, equipment and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or deemed cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 5 to 50 years Leasehold buildings life of the lease Plant, machinery and vehicles 4 to 20 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The Group has chosen to take the first time adoption exemption available under IFRS1 to use a previous revaluation for certain land and buildings as its deemed cost at the transition date.
All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost unless it is felt that this value should be impaired.
Assets held for sale A non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 99 Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Groups investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available for sale financial assets.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on available for sale monetary items, are recognised directly in equity.
When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Trade receivables and trade payables are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Derivative financial instruments of the Group are used to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments, as follows: Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The unhedged gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the year end date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate such contracts at the year end date, taking into account the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.
Where derivative financial instruments are used to hedge cash flow risk, such as interest rate swaps, the effective part of any gain or loss on the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in the hedge reserve, while any ineffective part is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Amounts recorded in the hedge reserve are subsequently reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement when the interest expense is actually recognised.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, at hedge inception and on a half yearly basis, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been, and are likely to continue to be, effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Any gain or loss on translation of monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities arising from a movement in exchange rates subsequent to initial measurement is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the closing exchange rate.
Income statements and cash flows of such undertakings are translated into Sterling at weighted average rates of exchange, other than substantial transactions that are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
The adjustments to period end rates are taken to the cumulative translation reserve in equity and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
When an overseas operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in equity and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 100 Group Accounting Policies continued The principal exchange rates used were as follows: 2016 2015 Average Closing Average Closing Sterling to Euro 1 EUR 1.22 1.17 1.38 1.36 Sterling to US Dollar 1 USD 1.35 1.23 1.53 1.48 Sterling to Swedish Krona 1 SEK 11.57 11.14 12.90 12.50 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, the FIFO or average cost method is used.
Cost for work in progress and finished goods comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
In accordance with the Groups environmental policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised as an obligation arises.
The estimated cost of returning properties held under leases to their original condition in accordance with the terms of specific lease contracts is recognised as soon as such costs are able to be reliably estimated.
Impairment of assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories see accounting policy Inventories and deferred tax balances see accounting policy Deferred taxation, are reviewed at each year end date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment.
Impairment reviews are undertaken at the level of each significant cash generating unit, which are no larger than operating segments as defined in IFRS8 Segmental reporting.
If such an indication exists, the relevant assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of the asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite life, the recoverable amount is assessed at each year end date and an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Leases Leases for which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Other leases are classified as operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised as revenue in the Consolidated Income Statement on an accruals basis.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 101 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods and services represents the amount excluding value added tax invoiced to third party customers, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
In the Galvanizing Services segment this is generally considered to be on completion of the galvanizing process when products are made available for customer collection.
In the Infrastructure Products segments products are often bespoke and customer contracts more complex.
As such, there are a number of conditions which must be satisfied before revenue can be recognised.
These can include: legal, contractual ownership: passing internal quality control testing: dispatch from manufacturing sites: installation at customer sites: customer inspection both before and after installation: and or, ultimately, customer acceptance.
Given these conditions, a greater degree of consideration is given as to whether the terms of sale have been met and whether revenue can be recognised for each product.
Government grants Government grants are recognised as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and credited to operating profit over the estimated useful economic life of the relevant assets or the length of employment specified in the grant.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to not give external guarantees.
Retirement benefits The Group operates pension schemes under which contributions by employees and by the sponsoring companies are held in trust funds separated from the Groups finances.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
This benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the year end date on AA rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
Scheme assets are valued at bid price.
In the Consolidated Income Statement current and past service costs are recognised in operating profit and the interest cost on the net defined benefit obligations is included in financial expense.
All actuarial gains and losses in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes are recognised annually in reserves and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Share-based payment transactions The fair value of shares options granted is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity reserves.
The fair value is calculated at the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares options.
The BlackScholes model has been adopted as the method of evaluating the fair value of the options where vesting is based on non-market conditions, while a Monte Carlo Simulation is used where vesting is based on market conditions.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no adjustment for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of amounts payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights settled in cash is recognised as an employee expense and corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the payment.
Financial income and expense Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Financial expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, interest cost on net pension scheme obligations, unwinding of discounts, losses on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the interest expense component of finance lease payments and financial expenses related to refinancing.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method with the exception of those meeting the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 23. www.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 102 Group Accounting Policies continued Non-underlying items Non-underlying items are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Income Statement where the quantum, nature or volatility of such items would otherwise distort the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The following are included by the Group in its assessment of non-underlying items: Gains or losses arising on disposal, closure, restructuring or reorganisation of businesses that do not meet the definition of discontinued operations.
Amortisation of intangible fixed assets arising on acquisitions.
Impairment charges in respect of tangible or intangible fixed assets.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Significant past service items or curtailments and settlements relating to defined benefit pension obligations resulting from material changes in the terms of the schemes.
Net financing costs or returns on defined benefit pension obligations.
Costs incurred as part of significant refinancing activities.
The tax effect of the above is also included.
Details in respect of the non-underlying items recognised in the current and prior year are set out in note 3 to the Financial Statements.
Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items either recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full using the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position liability method and represents the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities not resulting from a business combination that affects neither accounting or taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the year end date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each year end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Ordinary dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBT are included in the Group Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

Non-underlying items Non-underlying items included in operating profit comprise the following: Business reorganisation costs of 10.5m 2015: 0.3m relating to the closure or reorganisation of three of the Groups businesses as set out below.
On 9 March 2016 the Group announced its intention to exit its non-US Pipe Supports business, involving cessation of manufacturing in the UK and Thailand, the closure of its sales office in China and the transfer of work to its facility in India.
An initial provision of 9.2m was made in respect of the estimated costs of closure.
Subsequently 1.4m of this provision has been released following the favourable settlement of certain matters resulting in a net charge to the income statement of 7.8m.
Following the acquisition of Signature Limited on 3 August 2016, the Group has commenced a reorganisation of the business as part of its integration with Mallatite Limited, the Groups existing lighting column operation.
The cost of the reorganisation and restructuring plan is 0.8m.
The plan includes a reduction in the number of operating sites of the integrated business from five to three.
In December 2016 the Group committed to the closure of Hill & Smith Infrastructure Products India Pvt.
Limited, our Roads business in India.
The cost of the closure is expected to be 1.9m, which has been provided for in full in the year to 31 December 2016.
Closure is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.
In recent years CA Traffic Limited has generated levels of profitability that are below those anticipated when the business was acquired in 2006.
The current and forecast financial performance of the business part of the Infrastructure Products Roads segment is below that assumed in the impairment reviews performed at 31 December 2015 and 30 June 2016.
As a result, a further impairment review was performed at the end of the year based on the Boards revised expectation of future profitability and cash generation.
The impairment review concluded that the carrying values of the assets of the business were less than their recoverable amount determined by reference to the Value in Use by 4.1m, representing the value of the goodwill arising on acquisition.
The basis for determining the Value in Use, including the discount rate, was consistent with that used in the annual impairment review performed as at 31 December 2015.
Amortisation of acquired intangible fixed assets of 2.6m 2015: 1.6m.
Acquisition expenses of 1.8m 2015: 1.0m principally relating to acquisitions made by the Group during the year.
A gain of 0.2m relating to the settlement of certain defined benefit pension obligations during the year see note 23.
Non-underlying items included in financial expense represent the net financing cost on pension obligations of 0.5m 2015: 0.7m and a 0.4m charge in respect of amortisation of costs associated with refinancing 2015: 0.4m.

Impairment tests on the carrying values of goodwill and certain US Galvanizing brand names of 8.2m 2015: 6.9m, which are the Groups only other indefinite life intangible assets, are performed by analysing the carrying value allocated to each significant cash generating unit against its value in use.
All goodwill is allocated to specific cash generating units which are in all cases no larger than operating segments.
Value in use is calculated for each cash generating unit as the net present value of that units discounted future cash flows.
These cash flows are based on budget cash flow information for a period of one year, strategic plans for the following two years and an average growth rate of 3% applied subsequently based on managements estimate for revenue and associated cost growth.
Budgets and strategic plans are prepared taking into account a range of factors including past experience, the forecast future trading environment and macroeconomic conditions in the Groups key markets.
The long-term growth rate assumption reflects the historical long-term growth rates of the developed economies in which the Group principally operates.
These assumptions are applied to all CGUs with the exception of the CA Traffic CGU and France Galva SA CGU, further details of which are set out below.
The calculated headroom between value in use and carrying value of each of the cash generating units with significant amounts of goodwill, together with the pre-tax discount rates applied, is set out below.
Hardstaff Barriers is excluded from this table as the CGU was acquired in May 2016 and there have been no factors arising since its acquisition that would indicate an impairment.
2016 2015 Headroom Discount Headroom Discount m rate m rate Creative Pultrusions 42.8 11.8% 21.2 12.6% France Galva SA 4.1 13.7% 2.5 14.4% Galvanizing Services - USA 233.6 12.1% 134.5 13.5% Galvanizing Services - UK 63.8 11.0% 25.7 12.2% The pre-tax discount rates detailed above equate to post-tax discount rates of between 9.5% and 10.0%, derived from a market participants cost of capital and risk adjusted for individual cash generating units circumstances.
Similar discount rates are applied in determining the recoverable amounts of other cash generating units.
The discount rates applied in determining headroom in both 2016 and 2015 are broadly consistent.
CA Traffic The 2016 financial performance of the CA Traffic CGU was below that assumed in the impairment review carried out at 31 December 2015, and below the CGUs budget for 2016, due to the deterioration in performance in the second half of 2016.
As a result the impairment review performed during the year was based on the Boards revised expectations of future profitability and cash flow forecasts, which are lower than the 2017 budget and strategic plan.
The impairment review concluded that the carrying value of the assets of the business were less than their recoverable amount determined by reference to the value in use by 4.1 million, representing the total value of the goodwill arising on acquisition.
The basis for determining the value in use, including the discount rate was consistent with that used in the annual impairment review performed as at 31 December 2015.
The review concluded that no further impairment charge in relation to the remaining assets of the CA Traffic CGU was required.
The Group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonable possible changes in assumptions could cause an impairment that would be material to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The sensitivity analyses did not identify any material impairments with the exception of the goodwill attributed to France Galva SA.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 117 10.
Intangible assets continued France Galva SA The France Galva SA impairment review was prepared based on the following key assumptions: Budgeted cash flows for 2017, which assumed a 2% reduction in galvanizing volumes compared with 2016, and were driven by market conditions in France at the time that the budget was set.
For 2018 and beyond the calculations assume future annual growth in galvanizing volumes of 1%.
This assumption is considered appropriate as, in the Groups experience, galvanizing volumes are closely linked to growth in activity in industrial markets, itself closely linked to country GDP growth.
The current GDP growth projections for France issued by the IMF exceed 1%.
This assumption results in future cash flows that are higher than the original strategic plan for 2018 and 2019 and reflects the improvement in the performance of the business in 2016 compared with the prior year.
Galvanizing volumes are the key assumption on which the goodwill impairment review is most sensitive.
A reduction of 1.7% in the 2017 budgeted volumes, assuming the same future growth rates thereafter, would reduce the headroom to zero.
In the event that budgeted volumes for 2017 are achieved but that there is no subsequent growth, a goodwill impairment charge of 18.1m would arise.
The carrying value of goodwill of 28.8m would be fully impaired if future volumes were assumed to fall by 1.2% per annum.

In the UK Budget on 8 July 2015, the UK Government proposed to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.
In the Budget on 16 March 2016 a further rate reduction to 17% was proposed from 1 April 2020, instead of the reduction to 18% as originally planned.
The deferred tax balance in respect of UK entities has therefore been calculated at 17% 2015: 18% on the basis that these balances will materially reverse after 1 April 2020.
In addition a reduction in the French corporation tax rate to 28% by 2020 was enacted in December 2016.
The deferred tax balance in respect of French entities has therefore been calculated at 28% 2015: 33.33% on the basis that these balances will materially reverse after 1 April 2020.

Primarily the issues identified relate to sites acquired through acquisitions of subsidiaries.
As a consequence of the long-term nature of the liabilities, the timescales are uncertain and the provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the associated costs.
The Group has sought expert external valuations where appropriate.
Restructuring provisions Restructuring provisions represent the cash costs of closing or rationalising operations.
The provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the liabilities arising and are expected to be settled within the next twelve months.
Other provisions Other provisions relate to various obligations including obligations in respect of onerous leases, property dilapidations and claims or disputes.
Financial instruments a Management of financial risks Overview The Group has exposure to a number of risks associated with its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of these risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
A programme of commercial, operating, financial and third party reviews is in place to assist the Group Audit Committee with its assessment of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control procedures.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
It is the Groups policy to insure a substantial part of the Groups trade receivables.
Any residual risk is spread across a significant number of customers.
As such the impairment losses are not significant.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board and are reviewed regularly.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Groups UK companies represent the majority of the trade receivable at 31 December 2016 with 57% 2015: 56% and currently the only geographical region that does not generally insure trade receivables is North America, which represents 21% 2015: 22% of the Groups trade receivables.
Subsidiaries in North America have a policy of taking out trade references before granting credit limits and selectively insuring where it is deemed necessary by management.
The Groups policy is to not provide financial guarantees.
At 31 December 2016 and 2015, no guarantees were outstanding.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
It is the Groups policy to minimise its liquidity risk in terms of limiting the amounts of borrowings maturing within the next 12 months.
As at 31 December 2016 all such debt was covered by cash and cash equivalents netting to 15.3m positive current liquidity 2015: 12.6m.
The Groups principal UK revolving credit facility is a multicurrency agreement with a maturity date of April 2021 and a value at 31 December 2016 of 232.3m 2015: 213.1m, based on year end exchange rates.
Along with various other on demand lines of credit, including bank overdrafts and finance leases, the Group has access to facilities of 247.1m 2015: 225.6m.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Counterparty risk A group of relationship banks provides the bulk of the banking services, with pre-approved credit limits set for each institution.
Financial derivatives are entered into with these core banks and the underlying credit exposure to these instruments is included when considering the credit exposure to the counterparties.
At the end of 2016 credit exposure including cash deposited did not exceed 3.6m with any single institution 2015: 1.9m.
Currency risk The Group publishes its Consolidated Financial Statements in Sterling, but conducts business in several foreign currencies, including significant operations based in Continental Europe and North America.
This results in foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the Groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign operations.
The trading currency of each operation is predominantly in the same denomination, however, the Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge the majority of exposures that do exist.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to these derivative financial instruments.
The Group has hedged its investment in US and European operations by way of financing the acquisitions through like denominations of its multi-currency banking facility.
The Groups investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged because fluctuations on translation of their assets into Sterling are not significant to the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group adopts interest rate swaps when engaging in long-term specific investments or contracts in order to more reliably assess the financial implications of these procurements.
However, the Group currently feels that using fixed interest rates for short-term day-to-day trading is not appropriate.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest rate swaps in order to fix interest rates on up to 40% of its outstanding gross borrowings.
At 31 December 2016 the proportion of gross borrowings subject to fixed interest rate swaps was 0% 2015: 26%.

Financial instruments continued Insurance The Group purchases insurance for commercial, legal and contractual reasons.
The Group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not commercially viable.
Capital management The Board maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There are financial covenants associated with the Groups borrowings, which are interest cover and EBITDA to net debt.
The Group comfortably complied with these covenants in 2016 and 2015, as set out in the Operational and Financial Review on page 23.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
b Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out the Groups accounting classification of its financial assets and liabilities and their fair values as at 31 December.
The fair values of all financial assets and liabilities are not materially different to the carrying values.

The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either as a direct price or indirectly derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Financial instruments continued At 31 December 2016 the Group did not have any liabilities classified at Level 1 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
There have been no transfers in any direction in the year.
The Groups financial assets, excluding short term receivables, consist mainly of cash and call deposit accounts.
Where cash surpluses arise in the short term, interest is earned based on a floating rate related to bank base rate or LIBOR EURIBOR US LIBOR.
Where the Groups funding requirements allow longer term investment of surplus cash, management will review available options to obtain the best possible return whilst maintaining an appropriate degree of access to the funds.
The Groups financial liabilities, excluding short term creditors, are set out below.
Fixed rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling denominated finance leases.
Floating rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling, Euro and US Dollar bank loans and overdrafts, and Sterling finance leases and hire purchase agreements.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates related to bank base rates or LIBOR EURIBOR US LIBOR.
Each subsidiary has financial assets and liabilities which are predominantly in the same denomination as that subsidiarys functional currency.
Excluding the UK Parent Company, the financial assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of these entities are insignificant to the Group.
The UK Parent Company and certain of its UK subsidiaries hold Euro 11.1m 2015: 11.4m and US Dollar 53.6m 2015: 25.2m denominated interest bearing loans, which are predominantly used to fund the Groups European and United States operations and include 64.7m 2015: 36.9m designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.
The foreign currency loss of 9.5m 2015: loss of 0.4m for the effective portion was recognised directly in equity netted against exchange differences on translation of foreign operations.
Any ineffective portion recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is insignificant.

Any ineffective portion of these hedges is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement and was insignificant.
The fair value of forward currency exchange contracts realised in the Consolidated Income Statement as part of fair value derivatives amounted to nil 2015: nil.
The fair values of the Groups other financial instruments at 31 December 2016 and 2015 were not materially different to their carrying value.
Fair values were calculated using market rates where available, otherwise cash flows were discounted at prevailing rates.
Impairment charges of 4.1m 2015: 15.7m were recognised in respect of the carrying values of non-current assets, as detailed in note 10. e Credit risk Exposure to credit risk The exposure to credit risk is substantially mitigated by the credit insurance employed by the Group.
In the absence of this insurance the maximum credit exposure on the carrying value of financial assets at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2016 2015 m m Loans and receivables 106.1 92.3 Cash at the end of the year 15.6 12.9 Total 121.7 105.2 At the reporting date the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables, ignoring credit insurance was: Carrying value of trade receivables by geography 2016 2015 m m UK 59.7 51.4 Rest of Europe 16.3 12.8 North America 21.9 20.1 Rest of World 6.4 6.8 Total 104.3 91.1 Carrying value of trade receivables by business segment 2016 2015 m m Infrastructure Products - Utilities 41.6 38.3 Infrastructure Products - Roads 33.2 26.2 Infrastructure Products - Total 74.8 64.5 Galvanizing Services 29.5 26.6 Total 104.3 91.1 www.

Financial instruments continued Impairment losses The Group maintains a substantial level of credit insurance covering the majority of its trade receivables which mitigates against possible impairment losses, therefore such impairment losses are not significant.

Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At the end of the reporting periods, the effects of hypothetical changes in interest and currency rates are as follows: Based on average month end net debt balances that are not subject to an interest rate swap, if interest rates had varied throughout the year by 1% the positive or negative variation on the years result would have been 1.4m 2015: 0.9m, which would directly impact on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Based on a 10% weakening in Sterling against all currencies throughout the year, the impact on the Consolidated Income Statement would have been a gain of 3.4m 2015: 2.7m and the impact on equity would have been a gain of 18.9m 2015: 17.9m.
Based on a 10% strengthening in Sterling against all currencies throughout the year, the impact on the Consolidated Income Statement would have been a loss of 2.8m 2015: 2.2m and the impact on equity would have been a loss of 15.5m 2015: 14.6m.

The weighted average exercise price of outstanding options exercisable at the year end was 336p.
Share-based payments The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the BlackScholes model where vesting is based on non-market conditions, or a Monte Carlo Simulation where vesting is based on market conditions.
The contractual life is the life of the option in question and the growth in dividend yield is based on the best current estimate of future yields over the contractual period.

In March 2016 the Group completed a merger of these schemes into one new scheme, the Hill & Smith 2016 Pension Scheme the Scheme.
As part of the merger, certain members of the existing schemes accepted the Groups offer to crystallise their pension entitlement by payment of a winding up lump sum.
The effect of this was to reduce defined benefit obligations by 2.4m but reduce the value of scheme assets by 2.2m, resulting in a net settlement gain of 0.2m, which is recognised as a non-underlying credit in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets of the Scheme are administered by Trustees and are kept entirely separate from those of the Group.
Independent actuarial valuations are carried out every three years.
Contribution rates are determined on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, with the objective of providing the funds required to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
There are also separate personal pension plans.
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year includes a pension charge within operating profit of 1.6m 2015: 2.1m, which includes the costs of the defined contribution and the defined benefit sections of the Scheme.

Pensions continued The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being: Risk Description Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create a plan deficit.
The Scheme holds a proportion of its assets in equities and other growth assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term.
However, returns are likely to be volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase in the defined benefit obligation recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes investments in corporate and government bonds.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation leading to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the members, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was last carried out as at 5 April 2015 and was updated to 31 December 2016 by a qualified actuary.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Pensions continued Overseas In France the Group provides certain long term benefits and operates post employment defined benefit plans which provide lump sum benefits at retirement in accordance with collective labour agreements.
Some of those plans are funded with insurance companies.
In the USA Bergen Pipe Supports, Inc. operates a defined benefit pension plan comprising current and deferred pensioners such that no future benefits accrue.
The Group also operates defined contribution plans in a number of other overseas operations.
The amount contributed to these plans during the year was 0.6m 2015: 0.6m.
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year includes a pension charge within operating profit of 0.9m 2015: 0.6m, which includes the costs of the defined contribution schemes and the defined benefit schemes.
Composition of the schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes in France and the USA.
Actuarial valuations of the schemes were carried out by independent actuaries as at 31 December 2016.

Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements The principal accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements employed in the preparation of these Consolidated Group Financial Statements which could affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the year end date are as follows: Actuarial assumptions on pension obligations In determining the valuation of the defined benefit pension deficit, certain assumptions about the scheme have been made, notably the expected return on assets, inflation, discount rates, mortality and pension increases.
The factors affecting these assumptions are largely outside the Groups control note 23.
Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets should be impaired requires the estimation of future cash flows and growth factors adopted by each cash generating unit.
Furthermore, discount rates applied to these cash flows are determined by reference to the markets in which they operate and are risk adjusted to reflect risks and opportunities existing for each cash generating unit.
These factors are all affected by prevailing market and economic factors outside the Groups control.
Further information on this issue is included in note 10.
Environmental and dilapidation provisions Estimated environmental and dilapidation costs have been derived on the basis of the most recent assessments of the likely cost.
Certain factors concerning these costs are outside the Groups control.
In making this assessment the Group has sought the aid of independent experts where appropriate.
Further information is included in note 19.
Taxation Management is required to make an estimate of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
Liabilities for tax contingencies also require management judgements and estimates in respect of tax audit issues and exposures in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Where management concludes that a tax position is uncertain, a current tax liability is held for anticipated taxes that are considered probable based on the information available.
The key judgement area for the Group is the pricing of intercompany goods and services between subsidiaries in different countries.
Included in the current tax payable is a liability of 6.1m 2015: 5.7m for uncertain tax positions.
Management engages with professional advisors in making its assessment and, if appropriate, will liaise with the relevant taxation authorities to resolve the matter.
The tax liability is reassessed in each period to reflect managements best estimate in light of the information available.
If the final outcome of these matters differs from the liability held in the Financial Statements, the difference may impact the income tax charge credit in the year in which the matter is concluded.
Further information is set out in note 7 and note 13. www.
com | Stock Code HILS Financial Statements 136 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24.
Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements continued Valuation of intangible assets Where an acquisition is of a significant size, it is reviewed by independent experts to assess the specific intangibles arising from the acquisition.
Brands, contractual arrangements and customer lists have been identified as part of this process and are disclosed in note 10.
The reasons for the residual excess of consideration over net asset value are then determined to identify the reasons for goodwill arising, which in the case of recent acquisitions, has resulted mainly from assembled workforce, technical expertise, know-how, market share and geographical advantages.
Brands have been valued based on estimated royalty rates discounted over their useful lives, which is normally 20 years, but considered indefinite for the US Voigt & Schweitzer brand which has been successfully trading for over 50 years.
Customer relationships have been valued based on discounted forecast revenues and have been deemed to have useful economic lives of between five and ten years based upon the average expected length of relationships with customers.
Other contractual arrangements have been valued based on either replacement cost or an income approach utilising with or without methodology and have been deemed to have estimated useful economic lives of between 8 and 10 years.
