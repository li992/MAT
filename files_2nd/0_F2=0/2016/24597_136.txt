Ogden discount rate impact The personal injury discount rate or Ogden rate is a rate set by the UK Governments Lord Chancellor that is used by the Courts to calculate lump sum personal injury compensation payments.
The rate was set at 2.5% in 2001 and on 7 December 2016, the Ministry of Justice announced that it was undertaking a review of the Ogden rate.
The review concluded on 27 February 2017 with the announcement that the Ogden rate will reduce from 2.5% to minus 0.75% with effect from 20 March 2017.
This will increase the value of lump sum settlements awarded.
The Group has reflected the rate change to minus 0.75% in estimating the claims liabilities at 31 December 2016, and the full impact of this change on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, which is considered to warrant separate disclosure given its significance, is shown in the table below: 31 December 2016 Underlying trading Ogden pre-Ogden discount rate Underlying Non-trading rate change impact trading items Total m m m m m Net earned premiums 334.8 334.8 334.8 Other revenue 254.9 6.6 248.3 248.3 Investment and interest income 7.2 7.2 7.2 Net revenue 596.9 6.6 590.3 590.3 Claims incurred 551.7 160.1 711.8 711.8 Reinsurers share of claims incurred 305.0 146.7 451.7 451.7 Net claims incurred 246.7 13.4 260.1 260.1 Acquisition costs 51.9 51.9 51.9 Other expenses 146.2 146.2 146.2 Adjusted operating profit 152.1 20.0 132.1 Amortisation and depreciation 5.6 5.6 22.0 27.6 Finance costs 9.6 9.6 0.6 10.2 Profit before tax 136.9 20.0 116.9 22.6 94.3 Taxation expense 22.0 2.0 20.0 4.1 15.9 Total profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent 114.9 18.0 96.9 18.5 78.4 Estimating the claims liabilities required at 31 December 2016 using an Ogden rate of minus 0.75%, announced on 27 February 2017, increased claims incurred by 160.1m as a result of the anticipated increase in the value of expected settlements of large personal injury claims.
Of the gross amount, 146.7m is expected to be recovered from our reinsurance partners and has therefore increased the reinsurers share of claims incurred and reinsurance assets.
Net claims incurred increased by 13.4m and this subsequently reduced profit commission by 6.6m, resulting in a net reduction in adjusted operating profit and profit before tax of 20.0m.
