Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report and Business review on pages 2 to 35.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described within the Business review.
In addition, note 4.4 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 4.2 to the financial statements, the Groups financing is based upon securitised debt.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
95 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 1 Basis of preparation continued Recent accounting developments The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which have been adopted by the Group in these financial statements for the first time: Accounting standard Requirement Impact on financial statements IAS 19 amendments Defined Benefit Plans: The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Defined The application of these amendments has had no impact Employee Contributions Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions for the first time in on the Groups financial statements, as the defined benefit the current period.
The amendments to IAS 19 clarify the pension scheme is closed to future accrual and hence there requirements that relate to how contributions from employees is no current service cost recognised.
or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service.
In addition, it permits a practical expedient if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service.
The amendments require the Group to account for employee contributions as follows: Discretionary employee contributions are accounted for as reduction of the service cost upon payments to the plans.
Employee contributions specified in the defined benefit plans are accounted for as reduction of the service cost, only if such contributions are linked to services.
Specifically, when the amount of such contribution depends on the number of years of service, the reduction to service cost is made by attributing the contributions to periods of service in the same manner as the benefit attribution.
On the other hand, when such contributions are determined based on a fixed percentage of salary i. e. independent of the number of years of service, the Group recognises the reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related services are rendered.
Amendments to IFRSs as part of the Annual The Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 to 2012 have made The amendments to IFRS 8 require an entity to disclose Improvements to IFRSs 2010 to 2012 Cycle a number of amendments to IFRSs.

Beyond this, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Accounting standard Effective date IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 subject to EU endorsement The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset is of low value.
The above standard reflects a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee accounting model, and as such, requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less.
Accounting requirements for lessors is substantially unchanged from IAS 17.
The impact of the standard on the Group is currently being assessed and it is not yet practicable to quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Details of the Groups critical accounting judgements and estimates are described within the accounting policy section in each of the notes to the financial statements listed below: Note 2.2 Separately disclosed items Note 3.1 Property, plant and equipment Note 4.5 Pensions 97 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 2 Results for the year 2.1 Segmental analysis Accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenue is the fair value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting sales-based taxes, coupons and staff discounts.
The majority of revenue comprises food and beverages sold in the Groups businesses.
This revenue is recognised at the point of sale to the customer.
Revenue arising from the sale of development property is recognised on legal completion of the sale.
Operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be based on the Groups internal reporting to its Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM is regarded as the Chief Executive together with other Board members.
The CODM uses EBITDA and profit before interest and adjusted items operating profit pre-adjustments as the key measures of the segment results.
Group assets are reviewed as part of this process but are not presented on a segment basis.
The retail operating business operates all of the Groups retail operating units and generates all of its external revenue.
The property business holds the Groups freehold and long leasehold property portfolio and derives all of its income from the internal rent levied against the Groups retail operating units.
At a macro level, rent is set on a market-based measure with this being reviewed on a five yearly basis.
At a micro level, the property business charges rent to the retail operating business based on the performance of the individual outlets.
The internal rent charge is eliminated at the total Group level.

This adjusted information is disclosed to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group and is consistent with the Groups internal management reporting.
Separately disclosed items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence and include movements in the valuation of the property portfolio as a result of the annual revaluation exercise, impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties, restructuring costs and effects of corporation tax rate change.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates Judgement is used to determine those items which should be separately disclosed to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
This judgement includes assessment of whether an item is of sufficient size or of a nature that is not consistent with normal trading activities.
The items identified in the current period are as follows: 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks Notes m m Adjusted items Net profit arising on property disposals a 1 7 Movement in the valuation of the property portfolio see note 3.1 : Impairment arising from the revaluation 80 54 Other impairment b 8 11 Net movement in the valuation of the property portfolio 88 65 Total adjusted items before tax 87 58 Tax credit relating to above items 18 14 Tax credit in respect of change in tax legislation note 2.4 c 14 Total adjusted items after tax 55 44 a.

b. Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties where their carrying values exceed their recoverable amount.
See note 3.1 for further details.
2 Act 2015 was enacted on 18 November 2015 and reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017.
The Finance Act 2016 was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016 and reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020.
The effect of these changes has been reflected in the closing deferred tax balance at 24 September 2016.
2.3 Operating costs Accounting policies Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging adjusted costs but before investment income and finance costs.
Supplier incentives Supplier incentives and rebates are recognised within operating costs as they are earned.
The accrued value at the reporting date is included in other receivables.
Operating leases Group as lessee Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases and sub-leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a liability and a subsequent reduction in the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Such premiums are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current prepayments, with the current portion being the element which relates to the following period.
The Groups policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts.
Operating leases Group as lessor Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Information regarding key management personnel is included in note 5.1.
Detailed information regarding Directors emoluments, pensions, long-term incentive scheme entitlements and their interests in share options is given in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 58 to 81.
Lease commitments The vast majority of the Groups leases are industry standard UK pub or commercial property leases which provide for periodic rent reviews to open market value and enjoy statutory rights to renewal on expiry.
Generally they do not contain conditions relating to rent escalation, rights to purchase, concessions, residual values or other material provisions of an unusual nature.
Where sublet arrangements are in place, future minimum lease payments and receipts are presented gross.
Operating lease commitments Group as lessee Total future minimum lease rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Due within one year 52 48 Between one and five years 194 179 After five years 448 448 694 675 100 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report 2to35 Governance 36to81 Financial statements 82to138 Shareholder information 139 Operating lease receivables Group as lessor Total future minimum lease rental receipts under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Due within one year 8 8 Between one and five years 26 24 After five years 45 47 79 79 Lease income recognised in the year was as follows: 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Standard lease income 10 9 Auditor remuneration 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Fees payable to the Groups auditor for the: audit of the consolidated Group financial statements 0.1 0.1 audit of the Companys subsidiaries financial statements 0.3 0.3 Total audit fees 0.4 0.4 Other fees to auditors: audit related assurance services 0.1 0.1 corporate finance and tax advisory services 0.1 Total non-audit fees 0.1 0.2 Auditors remuneration of 0.3m 2015 0.3m was paid in the UK and 0.1m 2015 0.1m was paid in Germany.
2.4 Taxation Accounting policies The income tax expense represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the period, and deferred tax and is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are not taxable.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items that are charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount of their tax bases.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.

Unrecognised tax allowances At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax allowances of 66m in respect of unclaimed capital allowances 2015 52m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax allowances with a value of 11m 2015 10m because it is not certain that future taxable profits will be available in the company where these tax allowances arose against which the Group can utilise these benefits.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
Factors which may affect future tax charges The Finance No.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before adjusted items see note 2.2 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Short leasehold properties, unlicensed properties and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at cost less depreciation and impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell where this is lower.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost less residual value over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and is commenced when an asset is ready for its intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold and long leasehold properties are depreciated so that the difference between their carrying value and estimated residual value is written off over 50 years from the date of acquisition.
The residual value of freehold and long leasehold properties is reviewed annually.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over the unexpired term of the lease where this is less than 50 years.
Fixtures, fittings and equipment have the following estimated useful lives: Information technology equipment: 3 to 7 years Fixtures and fittings: 3 to 20 years Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year and adjusted if appropriate.
Disposals Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Revaluation The revaluation utilises valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspection of 20% of the sites such that all sites are individually valued approximately every five years: and estimates of fair maintainable trade.
Valuation multiples derived via third-party inspections are used to value the remainder of the non-inspected estate via an extrapolation exercise, with the output of this exercise reviewed at a high level by the third-party valuer.
Surpluses which arise from the revaluation exercise are included within other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve unless they are reversing a revaluation adjustment which has been recognised in the income statement previously: in which case an amount equal to a maximum of that recognised in the income statement previously is recognised in income.
Where the revaluation exercise gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected directly within the income statement, unless it is reversing a previous revaluation surplus against the same asset: in which case an amount equal to the maximum of the revaluation surplus is recognised within other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve.
Impairment Freehold properties excluded from the revaluation as a result of investment plans, along with short leasehold and unlicensed properties are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an outlet exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an outlets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Any changes in outlet earnings, or cash flows, the discount rate applied to those cash flows, or the estimate of sales proceeds could give rise to an additional impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
An impairment reversal is only recognised where there is a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amounts, not where it results from the passage of time.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The revaluation includes a significant judgement in respect of valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspections.
An estimate of fair maintainable trade and the resale value of tenants fixtures and fittings is also required in determining final site valuations.
Determining fair maintainable trade requires judgements to be made in respect of future projected income levels.
Where the value of a property derived purely from a multiple applied to the fair maintainable trade misrepresents the underlying property value, due to low levels of income or location characteristics, a spot valuation is applied.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not re-valued to fair market value are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recovered.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require management judgement around the selection of a suitable discount rate.
Value in use calculations also require management to estimate both future cash flows, via the application of growth assumptions, and future maintenance capital expenditure.
Depreciation and amortisation is provided so as to write down the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The selection of these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement.

Includes assets which are fully depreciated and have been removed from the fixed asset register.
Certain assets with a net book value of 43m 2015 40m owned by the Group are subject to a fixed charge in respect of liabilities held by the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Top-Up Scheme MABETUS.
Cost at 24 September 2016 includes 11m 2015 9m of assets in the course of construction.
Revaluation impairment The freehold and long leasehold properties have been valued at market value, as at 24 September 2016 using information provided by CBRE, independent chartered surveyors.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of location, quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not re-valued to fair market value have been reviewed for impairment using forecast cash flows, discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 7% 2015 7%.
This impairment relates to outlets with poor trading performance, that are unlikely to generate sufficient cash in the future to justify their current net book value.
106 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report 2to35 Governance 36to81 Financial statements 82to138 Shareholder information 139 Sensitivity analysis Changes in either the FMT or the multiple could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold properties.
It is estimated that, given the multiplier effect, a 2.5% change in the EBITDA of the freehold or long leasehold properties would generate an approximate 70m movement in their valuation.
It is estimated that a 0.1 change in the multiple would generate an approximate 32m movement in valuation.
It is estimated that a 1% increase in the discount rate applied during the impairment review, would increase the impairment of property, plant and equipment, which are not re-valued, by approximately 250,000.
Current year valuations have been incorporated into the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been taken to the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
The impact of the revaluations impairments described above is as follows: 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Income statement Revaluation loss charged as an impairment 144 90 Reversal of past impairments 64 36 Total impairment arising from the revaluation 80 54 Impairment of short leasehold and unlicensed properties 8 11 88 65 Revaluation reserve Unrealised revaluation surplus 329 141 Reversal of past revaluation surplus 113 116 216 25 Net increase decrease in property, plant and equipment 128 40 The valuation techniques are consistent with the principles in IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs such that the fair value measurement of each property within the portfolio has been classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
The key inputs to valuation on property, plant and equipment are as follows: EBITDA multiple range Net book a Number of value 24 September 2016 Low High pubs m Freehold properties 7.5 12.0 1,282 3,491 Long leasehold properties 7.5 11.0 90 268 Total revalued properties 7.5 12.0 1,372 3,759 Short leasehold properties 174 b Unallocated assets 490 Total property, plant and equipment 4,423 EBITDA multiple range Net book a Number of value 26 September 2015 Low High pubs m Freehold properties 7.0 12.0 1,363 3,566 Long leasehold properties 7.0 10.0 97 276 Total revalued properties 7.0 12.0 1,460 3,842 Short leasehold properties 182 b Unallocated assets 218 Total property, plant and equipment 4,242 a.
The carrying value of freehold and long leasehold properties based on their historical cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS is 2,683m and 191m respectively 2015 2,710m and 200m.
b. Unallocated assets primarily includes unlicensed properties and freehold properties excluded from revaluation as a result of investment plans.
Year on year movements in valuation multiples are the result of changes in property market conditions.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,780m 2015 3,585m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
In addition to the above, premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are classified separately in the balance sheet.
At 24 September 2016 an amount of 2m 2015 2m was included in the balance sheet.

3.3 Provisions Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured using the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Onerous property provisions represent the expected unavoidable losses on onerous and vacant property leases and comprise the lower of the net rent payable or the operating loss after rental costs.
The provision is calculated on a site by site basis, with an estimated period of future losses ranging from three to five years.
Other contractual dilapidations costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Provisions Provisions can be analysed as follows: Property leases m At 27 September 2014 12 Released in the period 3 Provided in the period 5 Utilised in the period 4 At 26 September 2015 10 Released in the period 2 Provided in the period 5 Utilised in the period 4 At 24 September 2016 9 109 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policies Business combinations and goodwill Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised respectively: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
If, after reassessment, the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the contingent consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates, at fair value, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in the income statement.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity is re-measured to its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The impairment review requires management to consider the recoverable value of the business to which the goodwill relates, based on either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use.
Value in use calculations require management to consider the net present value of future cash flows generated by the business to which the goodwill relates.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on managements estimate of the net proceeds which could be generated through disposing of that business.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Computer software Computer software and associated development costs, which are not an integral part of a related item of hardware, are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life.
The period of amortisation ranges between three and seven years with the majority being five years.

Thereafter they are stated at amortised cost using an effective interest basis.
Finance costs, which are the difference between the net proceeds and the total amount of payments to be made in respect of the instruments, are allocated over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs are not attributed to the acquisition or construction of assets and therefore no costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.

The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other Group companies.
At 24 September 2016, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of 103m 2015 108m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 36m 2015 36m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.

Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships: held-to-maturity investments: available-for-sale AFS financial assets: and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the instrument have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS, objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
115 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.4 Financial instruments continued For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the agreed credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either borrowings at amortised cost or other financial liabilities.
The borrowings accounting policy is provided in note 4.2.
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership but continues to control a transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability discharged and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the debt instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses interest rate and currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting is applied where the necessary criteria under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are met.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows at a rate that reflects the credit risk of various counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of highly probable future cash flows are recognised in equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Movements in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, the cumulative gain or loss in equity remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction affects profit or loss.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
116 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report 2to35 Governance 36to81 Financial statements 82to138 Shareholder information 139 Financial risk management Financial risk is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Groups Treasury function is governed by a Board Approved Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility along with two committed unsecured revolving credit facilities of 75m each.
The terms of the securitisation and the revolving credit facilities contain various financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group also has uncommitted revolving credit facilities of 15m.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and are used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances or committed facilities outside the securitisation to ensure that it can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.

Credit risk The Group Treasury function enters into contracts with third parties in respect of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and the investment of surplus funds.
These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long-term and A1 P1 F1 short-term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
An amount of 18m of collateral was posted by a swap counterparty within the securitisation as at 26 September 2015.
This collateral has been fully repaid during the period as a result of a change in the counterpartys credit rating.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Any exceptions are required to be formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four-weekly basis.

As disclosed in note 3.2, other financial assets relate to cash collateral provided by a swap counterparty, which has been fully repaid in the period.
Capital management The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 4.1 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity, and cash flow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt see also Funding and liquidity risk above and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its debt see note 4.2.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives.
The Board considers the latest covenant compliance, headroom projections and projected balance sheet positions periodically throughout the year, based on the advice of the Treasury Committee which meets on a four-weekly basis.
The Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Treasurer and monitors Treasury performance and compliance with Board-approved policies.
The Group Finance Director is also a member of the Committee.
Total capital at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Net debt note 4.1 1,840 1,870 Total equity 1,408 1,271 Total capital 3,248 3,141 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: At issuance of the Class A3N floating rate notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and initial interest elements of the notes.
The A3N notes form part of the securitised debt see note 4.2.
Further to the step-up on the A3N notes on 15 December 2010, the Group has additional foreign currency exposure as a result of the increase in US$ finance costs.
A movement of 10% in the US$ exchange rate would have nil 2015 nil impact on the reported Group profit and 25m 2015 22m impact on the reported Group net assets.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from its operations.
118 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report 2to35 Governance 36to81 Financial statements 82to138 Shareholder information 139 Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 2.0bn securitisation is largely fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
The Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point movement in interest rates is detailed below: 2016 2015 m m a Interest income 2 2 b Interest expense 2 2 Profit impact c Derivative financial instruments fair values 98 100 Total equity 98 100 a.

c. The impact on total equity from movements in the fair value of cash flow hedges.
Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a loss of 116m 2015 loss of 86m on cash flow hedges was recognised in equity.
A loss of 8m 2015 loss of 31m was recycled from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash flow hedges securitised borrowings At 24 September 2016, the Group held 10 2015 10 interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of 994m 2015 1,017m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of 994m 2015 1,017m of the Groups floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows on these contracts occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8625% 2015 4.8689%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The 10 interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 404m 2015 296m.
At 24 September 2016 the Group held one 2015 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 189m 2015 201m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N floating rate $317m 2015 $337m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 53m 2015 19m.
The cash flows on this contract occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a floating rate of interest at LIBOR in sterling.
The cash flows arising from interest rate swap positions on the same counterparty may be settled as a net position.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held under a separate agreement and cash movements for this instrument are settled individually.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments were measured at 24 September 2016 and may be subject to material movements in the period subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows: Derivative financial instruments fair value Non-current Current Current Non-current assets assets liabilities liabilities Total m m m m m Cash flow hedges: Interest rate swaps 44 360 404 Cross currency swap 52 1 53 24 September 2016 52 1 44 360 351 26 September 2015 19 43 253 277 119 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.4 Financial instruments continued The fair value and carrying value of financial assets and liabilities by category is as follows: 2016 2015 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value m m m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 158 158 163 163 Other cash deposits 120 120 120 120 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 53 53 19 19 Loans and receivables 18 18 32 32 Financial liabilities: Borrowings at amortised cost 2,173 2,167 2,174 2,234 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 404 404 296 296 Other 293 293 317 317 2,521 2,515 2,453 2,513 The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices.
As the securitised debt is traded on an active market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt.
The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or their book values approximate to fair values.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of each instrument at an appropriate discount rate to a mark to market position and then adjusting this to reflect any non-performance risk associated with the counterparties to the instrument.
IFRS 13 Financial Instruments requires the Groups derivative financial instruments to be disclosed at fair value and categorised in three levels according to the inputs used in the calculation of their fair value: Level 1 instruments use quoted prices as the input to fair value calculations: Level 2 instruments use inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly: Level 3 instruments use inputs that are unobservable.

These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit section of the plans is now closed to future service accrual.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
In addition, Mitchells & Butlers plc also provides a workplace pension plan in line with the Workplace Pensions Reform Regulations.
This automatically enrols all eligible workers into a Qualifying Workplace Pension Plan.
The total pension liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit arrangements is the greater of the minimum funding requirements, calculated as the present value of the agreed schedule of contributions, and the actuarial calculated liability.
The actuarial liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based on a number of financial assumptions and estimates, the determination of which may be significant to the balance sheet valuation in the event that this reflects a greater deficit than that suggested by the schedule of minimum contributions.
There is no current service cost as all defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual.
The net pension finance charge, calculated by applying the discount rate to the pension deficit or surplus at the beginning of the period, is shown within finance income or expense.
The administration costs of the scheme are recognised within operating costs in the income statement.
Re-measurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of minimum funding requirements, and the return on scheme assets are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable for that period.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The determination of the actuarial defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes requires judgement around the selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and longevity of current and future pensioners.
The determination of the actuarial defined benefit asset requires judgement in determining investment returns and long-term interest rates.
The determination of defined benefit liability based on minimum funding arrangements requires management judgement in the selection of an appropriate discount rate.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities Actuarial valuation The actuarial valuations used for IAS 19 revised purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2013 and updated by the schemes independent qualified actuaries to 24 September 2016.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 24 September 2016 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 revised requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high-quality corporate bonds.
The principal financial assumptions used at the balance sheet date have been updated to reflect changes in market conditions in the period and are as follows: 2016 2015 Pensions increases 2.9% 3.0% Discount rate 2.2% 3.6% Inflation rate 3.0% 3.1% The mortality assumptions were reviewed following the 2013 actuarial valuation as agreed on 21 May 2014.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2016 2015 Executive Executive Main plan plan Main plan plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 21.7 25.9 21.7 25.9 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 24.3 27.6 24.3 27.6 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 24.1 27.1 24.1 27.1 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 26.9 29.1 26.9 29.1 121 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.5 Pensions continued Minimum funding requirements The results of the 2013 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of 572m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 revised and on 21 May 2014 the Company formally agreed a new 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The Group made contributions of 45m per annum, for three years from 1 April 2013.
From 1 April 2016 the contributions have increased by the rate of RPI subject to a minimum increase of 0% and a maximum increase of 5% and will continue to increase on an annual basis for the following seven years.
As part of the recovery plan, the Group made a further payment of 40m on 23 September 2015 on terms agreed with the Trustees.
This agreement is subject to review following completion of the current ongoing actuarial valuation which commenced in March 2016.
The Group has therefore continued to make additional contributions during the current period as outlined above.
Under IFRIC 14, an additional liability is recognised, such that the overall pension liability at the period end reflects the schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement, should this be higher than the actuarial deficit.
Sensitivity to changes in discount rate The discount rate applied to the pension schemes liabilities is a significant driver of the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity.
It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, reduce or increase the actuarial deficit by approximately 53m 2015 39m.
A similar increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, reduce or increase the total pension liability by approximately 2m 2015 2m, with no material impact on the income statement charge.
Amounts recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes The following amounts relating to the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income: Group income statement 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Operating profit: Employer contributions defined contribution plans 7 7 Administrative costs defined benefit plans 2 2 Charge to operating profit 9 9 Finance costs: Net pensions finance charge on actuarial deficit 3 6 Additional pensions finance charge due to minimum funding 9 9 Net finance charge in respect of pensions 12 15 Total charge 21 24 Group statement of comprehensive income 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Return on scheme assets and effects of changes in assumptions 148 13 Movement in pension liability recognised due to minimum funding 126 7 Remeasurement of pension liability 22 6 Group balance sheet 2016 2015 52 weeks 52 weeks m m Fair value of scheme assets 2,381 2,010 Present value of scheme liabilities 2,587 2,112 Actuarial deficit in the schemes 206 102 Additional liability recognised due to minimum funding 131 248 a Total pension liability 337 350 Associated deferred tax asset 57 70 a.

The major categories and fair values of scheme assets of the MABPP and MABEPP schemes at the end of the reporting period are as follows: 2016 2015 Cash and equivalents 15 94 Equity instruments 633 556 Debt instruments: Bonds 1,600 1,298 Real estate debt 96 58 Infrastructure debt 50 Absolute return bond funds 198 197 Gilt repurchase transactions 202 192 Gold 5 3 Forward foreign exchange contracts 14 4 Fair value of assets 2,381 2,010 The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the period was 22.0% 2015 7.4%, which represented a gain of 427m 2015 131m.
Virtually all equity instruments, bonds and gold have quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1 instruments.
Absolute return bonds funds, gilt repurchase transactions and forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as Level 2 instruments.
Real estate debt and infrastructure debt are classified as level 3 instruments.
In the 52 weeks ended 24 September 2016 the Group paid 6m 2015 5m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements, with an additional 1m 2015 2m outstanding as at the period end.
At 24 September 2016 the MABPP owed 1m 2015 1m to the Group in respect of expenses paid on its behalf.
This amount is included in other receivables in note 3.2.
123 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the financial statements Section 4 Capital structure and financing costs continued 4.6 Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, employees are awarded shares or rights over shares.
The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions, on the date of grant.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated effect of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the number of shares that will eventually vest due to employees leaving the employment of the Group.
Fair values are calculated using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme.
This results in an accelerated recognition of the expense that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Schemes in operation The net charge recognised for share-based payments in the period was 2m 2015 2m.
The Group had four equity-settled share schemes 2015 four in operation during the period: the Performance Restricted Share Plan PRSP : Sharesave Plan: Share Incentive Plan and Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Further details on each scheme are provided in the Report on Directors remuneration on pages 58 to 81.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: 2016 2015 Performance Performance Restricted Sharesave Restricted Sharesave Share Plan Plan Share Plan Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo and Binomial Black-Scholes Monte Carlo and Binomial Black-Scholes Weighted average share price 239.5p 282.7p 366.3p 471.0p a Exercise price 264.0p 362.0p b Expected dividend yield 2.32% Risk-free interest rate 0.11% 0.69% 0.90% 1.14% c Volatility 32.8% 28.3% 27.0% 26.8% d Expected life years 2.92 3.99 3.0 3.92 a.
The exercise price for the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee.
The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave Plan has used historical dividend information.
For details on the Groups current dividend policy refer to the Financial review on page 35.
The expected dividend yield for the Performance Restricted Share Plan options is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
c. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
d. The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date.
The fair value of awards under the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to these schemes.

d. The exercise price for the Performance Restricted Share Plan is 1 per participating employee.
The weighted average share price during the period was 286.9p 2015 406.1p.
4.7 Equity Accounting policies Own shares The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury are deducted from shareholders equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders equity.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
