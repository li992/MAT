The groups long term strategy is to establish new businesses in adjacent markets with strong growth potential that align to the groups technology competences.

On 18th May 2015, the group acquired 100% of Stepac L. A. Ltd and its subsidiaries plus related assets from DS Smith International Limited.
Stepac is a provider of modified atmosphere packaging and the goodwill arising is attributable to opportunities to access expertise in this area and anticipated future synergies.
In addition, on 1st October 2015, the group acquired the Pharmorphix solid form research business from Sigma Aldrich.
The acquisition brings world leading material science capabilities to the groups expanding European Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient business.
