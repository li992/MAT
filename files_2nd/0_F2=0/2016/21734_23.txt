Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information a Basis of preparation Booker Group plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS101.
The amendments to FRS101 2013 14 Cycle issued in July 2014 and effective immediately have been applied.
In these financial statements, the Company has adopted FRS101 for the first time.
In transition to FRS101 there has been no effect on the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.
The Company has not taken advantage of the FRS101 disclosure exemptions.
In the transition to FRS101, the Company has applied IFRS1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS101.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
b New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union as set out in note 1 e to the group financial statements.
c Use of judgements and estimates Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below: IAS36 Impairment of assets.
In testing for impairment of investments and other assets, the Directors have made certain assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into perpetuity.
Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that investments included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
At 25 March 2016, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the investments or other assets to become impaired.
The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in a separate share option reserve.
This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, based on related service and non-market vesting conditions that are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS101 balance sheet at 28 March 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS101.
Guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
The carrying values of investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Share based payments The Company has issued equity settled share based payments to employees of a subsidiary.
The fair value is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
This fair value is accounted as an investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in equity.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Taxation The Company applies the same accounting policy as the group, as set out in note 2 of the Group financial statements.
Profit and loss account The audit fee of 0.1m 2015: 0.1m for the current and prior period was borne by another group undertaking without recharge.
a Employee information The Company had no employees throughout this or the previous period.
b Directors remuneration The Directors remuneration is borne by a subsidiary company and it is disclosed in the Remuneration Report.

Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings.
