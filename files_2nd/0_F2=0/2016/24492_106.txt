Clean EBITDA is the Groups alternative non-GAAP performance measure and is considered to be a key performance measure by the Directors as it serves as an indicator of financial performance and ability to service debt.
It is dened as operating profit adjusted for share-based payments, exceptional items, depreciation, amortisation, impairment of available for sale assets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Exceptional items are those items the Group considers to be non-recurring or material in nature that may distort an understanding of financial performance or impair comparability.
