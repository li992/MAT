1 Petroleum reserves Estimates of oil and gas reserves involve some degree of uncertainty, Developed oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be are subject to future revision.
Accordingly, financial and accounting expected to be recovered through: measures such as the standardised measure of discounted cash existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods: flows, depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges, the installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at assessment of impairments and the assessment of valuation the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not allowances against deferred tax assets that are based on reserve involving a well.

Performance-derived reserve assessments for producing wells How we estimate and report reserves were primarily based in the following manner: Petroleums reserves are estimated as of 30June 2016. for our conventional operations, reserves were estimated using Our proved reserves are estimated and reported according rate and pressure decline methods, including material balance, to US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulations supplemented by reservoir simulation models where appropriate: and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10 a for our Onshore US shale operations, rate-transient analysis and of Regulation S-X.

Our internal Group Australia and the United States also added 9 MMboe for the Risk Assessment and Assurance function provides secondary extension of our production sharing agreement in Algeria for assurance of the oil and gas reserve reporting processes the ROD field.

This reduction was primarily of ownership of the products.
At 30 June 2016, approximately the result of low product prices experienced during the reporting six per cent of the proved reserves were attributable to period, reductions in unconventional drilling activity that has such arrangements.
deferred drilling beyond five years and the reclassification of reserves that are not economic in the current price environment.
In accordance with applicable SEC regulations, the related volumes have been reclassified to non-proven reserves and resource categories.
As of 30 June 2016, approximately 77 per cent of our proved reserves were in conventional fields, while about 23 per cent of our proved reserves were in unconventional fields.

11 WAIO Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine.
Across WAIO, State Government approvals including environmental and heritage clearances are required before commencing mining operations in a particular area.
Included in the Ore Reserves are select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding, but where, based on the technical investigations carried out as part of the mine planning process and company knowledge and experience of the approvals process, it is expected that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.
12 WAIO Revised economic criteria within the mine plan has significantly reduced tonnage to the beneficiation plant.
Some BKM Bene Ore Reserves have been reclassified as BKM.
The decrease in Reserve Life was due to an increase in nominated production rate from 264Mt to 275Mt.
13 Samarco JV The decrease in Ore Reserves was due to discontinuation of operating permits following the Fundo dam failure in November 2015.
The declared Ore Reserves represent the basis for the re-start mine plan for which operating approvals have been requested and there is a reasonable expectation of permits being received within the next two years.
The re-start mine plan assumes storage of waste and tailings material in existing open-pit voids and complies with existing environmental licences.
Coal qualities are for a potential product on an air-dried basis.
4 Caval Ridge Coal Resources and Coal Reserves have been excised from Peak Downs and were reported separately in FY2016.
5 South Walker Creek Increase in Coal Resources due to an updated geological model.
6 Divestment of IndoMet Coal is in progress.
7 Peak Downs East and Saraji East Increase in Coal Resources due to revised classification criteria.
8 Lampunut Decrease in Coal Resources due to geological remodelling.
Drill hole spacings vary between seams and geological domains and were determined in conjunction with geostatistical analyses where applicable.

12 Coal delivered to wash plant, except for Haju where coal is not washed.
13 Goonyella Riverside Broadmeadow The increase in Reserve Life was due to a decrease in nominated production rate from 25Mt to 19Mt.
14 Norwich Park remains on care and maintenance.
15 Blackwater The increase in Reserve Life was due to a decrease in nominated production rate from 17.7Mt to 16.6Mt.
16 Crinum UG Coal Reserves were depleted in FY2016 while Gregory OC mine remains on care and maintenance.
17 South Walker Creek The Coal Reserves increased due to inclusion of new areas in the mine plan.
Increased yield from 71% to 79% delivered increased Marketable Coal Reserves.
18 Poitrel The Coal Reserves decrease was a result of pending environmental and capital approvals.
