ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Other income Other income represents dividend income which has been declared by its subsidiaries and is recognised when it is received.
Dividends payable for shareholders Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost or their recoverable amount.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the Company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade debtors, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses.
On confirmation that the trade debtor will not be collectable the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities including trade payables, other payables, accruals and amounts due to Group undertakings are originally recorded at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost under the effective interest method.
Investments in subsidiaries The investments in subsidiary companies are included in the Companys balance sheet at cost less provision for impairment.
Share based payments The expense relating to share based payments is accrued over the period in which the service is received and is measured at the fair value of those services received.
The extent to which the expense is not settled at the reporting period end is recognised as a liability as any shares outstanding remain contingently issuable.
Contingently issuable shares are treated as dilutive to the extent that, based on market factors prevalent at the reporting period date, the shares would be issuable.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Companys financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
There were no significant accounting judgements, estimates or assumptions in preparing these financial statements.
