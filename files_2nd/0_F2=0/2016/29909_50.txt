Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 2 Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Group Chief Executive, with support from the Executive Committee, as the function primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and assessment of performance of the segments.
In line with changes in management reporting and management structure reporting to the CODM, the Group has reassessed its reportable segments and determined: that the retailing and associated activities in the Republic of Ireland ROI, previously disclosed as part of the Europe segment, be combined in a UK and Republic of Ireland segment going forward: and that the retailing and associated activities in other countries, previously segregated between the Europe and the Asia segments, be combined in an International segment.
The principal activities of the Group are therefore presented in the following segments: Retailing and associated activities Retail in: UK & ROI the UK and Republic of Ireland: and International Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey: and Retail banking and insurance services through Tesco Bank in the UK Tesco Bank.
This presentation reflects how the Groups operating performance is reviewed internally by management.
Segmental information for the 53 weeks ended 28February 2015 has been restated accordingly.
In addition, the retailing and associated activities in the Republic of Korea Korea have been classified as discontinued operations in the current year, their performance in this year and comparative years is therefore part of discontinued operations as presented in Note 7 and excluded from segmental performances below.
The CODM uses operating profit before exceptional items, as reviewed at monthly Executive Committee meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it better reflects the segments underlying performance for the financial period under evaluation.
Operating profit before exceptional items is a consistent measure within the Group as defined within Note 1.
Refer to Note 4 for exceptional items.
Inter-segment revenue between the operating segments is not material.
The segment results and the reconciliation of the segment measures to the respective statutory items included in the Group Income Statement are as follows: Total at Total Tesco constant Foreign at actual 52 weeks ended 27 February 2016 UK & ROI International Bank exchange exchange exchange At constant exchange rates m m m m m m Continuing operations Revenue exc.
