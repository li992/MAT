Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
a Basis of preparation The Company has changed its accounting basis from the previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice Old UK GAAP to Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland FRS 102 for all periods presented.
In the transition to FRS 102 from Old UK GAAP, the Company has made measurement and recognition adjustments.
An explanation of how the transition to FRS 102 has affected the financial position and financial performance of the Company is provided in Note 9.
The Company has adopted the following disclosure exemptions permitted by FRS 102 1.12 b, c and e : The requirement to present a statement of cash flows: the requirement to disclose the terms and conditions of long term debt: and the requirement to disclose key management personnel compensation in total.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented.
The Companys loss for the year after taxation is 1,685,000 2015 3,598,000. b Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings comprise shares in, and loans to, those undertakings and are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
c Financial instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all financial liabilities.
Basic financial instruments i Trade and other creditors Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at transaction price less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, for example if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms, then it is measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate for a similar debt instrument.
ii Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recorded at amortised cost.
In the case of floating rate loans and borrowings, transaction costs are deducted from the fair value at recognition and any differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk arising from operational and financing activities.
As these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, Page 73 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued they are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently recorded, at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would recover or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
d Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided on timing differences which arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences arising because certain types of income or expenses are non-taxable or are disallowable for tax or because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the reversal of the related difference, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
e Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction and gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Profit on Ordinary Activities before Taxation The Company has no staff other than its Directors and their remuneration is set out on pages 29 and 30 of the Group accounts.
The parent company audit fee is disclosed on page 53 of the Group accounts.
Dividends 2016 2015 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014, paid 14 November 2014 @ 47p per share 7,659 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015, paid 6 March 2015 @ 35p per share 5,703 Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015, paid 13 November 2015 @ 53p per share 8,637 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016, paid 4 March 2016 @ 35p per share 5,703 14,340 13,362 Page 74 Daejan Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 The Board has recommended a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016 of 9,451,000, representing 58p per share.
This dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Creditors: Amounts falling due within one year 2016 2015 000 000 Bank loans and overdrafts 1,592 1,580 Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings 268,515 249,871 Other creditors and accruals 10,939 5,152 Derivative financial instruments 3,170 3,958 284,216 260,561 6.
Creditors: Amounts falling due after more than one year 2016 2015 000 000 Secured bank loans 63,535 65,127 7.
Share Capital 2016 2015 Number 000 000 Allotted, called up and fully paid: Ordinary shares of 25 pence per share 16,295,357 4,074 4,074 8.
Profit and Loss Reserve Some years ago, the Company sold its shareholdings in certain subsidiary undertakings to intermediate holding companies.
As a result of that transaction, the parent company transferred 645.1 million of revaluation gains relating to these investments to the profit and loss reserve.
As the transfer of these revaluation gains arose as a result of a sale of assets within the Group, it is unlikely that the Company will seek to treat the profit and loss reserve thus arising as distributable.
Under the articles of association of certain Group investment undertakings, realised capital surpluses are not available for distribution as dividends.

Explanation of transition to FRS 102 from old UK GAAP As stated in Note 1, these are the Companys first financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 102.
The accounting policies set out in Note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 and the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015.
In preparing its FRS 102 balance sheet, the Company has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to FRS 102 has affected the Companys financial position and financial performance is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.
Under FRS 102 these investments are now stated at original cost.
ii Derivative financial instruments Under FRS 102, as we have not adopted hedge accounting for these instruments, they are required to be separately recognised at their market value at period end, with movements in these values being recognised in the profit and loss account.
iii Deferred tax Under FRS 102 deferred tax is now recognised on these separately accounted for financial instruments.
