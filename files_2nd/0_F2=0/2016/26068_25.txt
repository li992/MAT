New and amended standards adopted by the Group No new standards, amendments or interpretations to standards effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2016 have had a material impact on the Groups financial position or performance nor thedisclosures in these financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31December 2016 year end and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The Groups assessment of the impact ofthese new standards and interpretations on its results, financial position andcash flows is set out below: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1January 2018, with early adoption permitted.
At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
This standard addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups results, financial position orcash flows.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: this standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.
Whilst this standard may impact on the timing of the recognition of certain of the Groups non-order driven revenue streams, the impact is not expected to be material.
Atthis stage, the Group does notintend to adopt the standard before its effective date.
IFRS 16 Leases: This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted, subject to EU endorsement.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 90 Financial statements 2.
Basis of preparation continued New standards and interpretations not yet adopted continued This standard will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and afinancial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Groups property leases.
As at the reporting date, the Group had non-cancellable property operating lease commitments of 35.3 million see Note 32.
The Group hasnot yet determined to what extent these commitments will result in the recognition of anasset and a liabilityforfuture payments and how this will affect the Groups financial position and reported results.
The anticipated financial impact of these three new accounting standards has not yet been fully assessed bytheGroup.
Further information regarding their impact will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report.

Underlying profit is defined as profit before tax before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, other gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and amortisation in respect of acquired intangible assets.
The total tax charge of 19.9 million 2015: 11.6 million is made up of: a current tax charge of 29.1 million 2015: 15.9 million, primarily consisting of corporate tax arising in the UK, Denmark, France and Switzerland: anda deferred tax credit of 9.2 million 2015: 4.3 million resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax asset on losses arising in Australia and the unwind of deferred tax liabilities arising on acquired intangibles.
As a result of the geographical spread of the Groups operations and the varied, increasingly complex nature of local and global tax law, there are some transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The provision held in relation to uncertain tax items totalled 9.8 million as at 31December 2016.
We expect our Underlying ETR to trend towards the UK prevailing corporation tax rate.
However, the Groups future tax charge and actual underlying ETR will be driven by a number of factors including: the timing of the recognition of tax losses: changes in the mix of our business profits: local or international tax reform for example any arising from the implementation of the OECDs BEPS actions and EU state aid investigations : new challenges by the tax authorities or the resolution of ongoing points raised by tax authorities: and the impact of any acquisitions, disposals or restructurings.

The amount of the asset not recognised asat 31December 2016 was 18.0 million 2015: 6.3 million.
The asset would be recognised if sufficient suitable taxable profits were made in the future and the recovery of the asset became probable.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOP and SIP.
Diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
The Group had potentially dilutive shares in the form of share options and unvested shares held pursuant to the Groups JSOP and SIP.
Adjusted earnings per share is the main measure of earnings per share used by the Group and is calculated using an underlying profit measure attributable to the holders of Ordinary Shares in the Parent, which is defined as profit attributable to the holders of Ordinary Shares in the Parent, before long-term employee incentive costs: exceptional items: other gains and losses: foreign exchange gains and losses: amortisation of acquired intangible assets: and the tax impact of the adjusting items.

As at 31 December 2015, accumulated impairment losses were 5.3 million and related to the Groups Dutch subsidiary, which was sold during 2016 seeNote 31.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of businesses and is attributable to the future growth of the acquired businesses, through expansion of their networks of Restaurant Partners and the number of orders per restaurant: anticipated future operating synergies: and the ability to leverage the Groups existing intellectual property in new markets around the world.
In addition, the goodwill balances represented the value of the businesses active consumer bases and assembled workforce, which do not meet the recognition criteria of an intangible asset.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated on acquisition to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated asfollows: Goodwill allocated by CGU as at 31 December 2016 2015 CGU Acquisitions including subsidiaries m m Australia & New Zealand ANZ Menulog Group Limited 456.0 384.9 SkipTheDishes Skip SkipTheDishes Restaurant Services Inc. 92.5 Spain ES SinDelantal Internet, S.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are the discount rate and the anticipated future cash flows which is a function of increases in the number of orders generated and increases in costs, together with other factors.
Management uses pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the particular CGU.
The assumptions on growth in orders, revenues, costs and future cash flows are based on past experience, recent results andmanagements future expectations.
The main drivers for future order growth are the continued investment in marketing, which helps drive brand awareness and drive consumer traffic to the Groups platforms, and the investment in technology which ensures the platforms are stable, secure, efficient and scalable.
This investment ensures that both the relevant overall market as well as the CGUs market share increases over the medium to long term.
com 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2016 13.
Goodwill continued The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board.
Management expects that some markets will enjoy a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the current budgetary cycle to maturity the medium term.
A suitable medium-term growth rate, based on previous experience of growth rates including historical growth rates of all CGUs, has been applied individually to reflect each CGUs activity in this period.
After this, a long-term growth rate is applied.
Management typically forecasts for periods up to five years, but there are some CGUs that are forecasted for longer periods.
These CGUs are located in immature markets which are currently lacking penetration, and where future investment in the business is expected to result in its long-term growth being achieved outside of five years.
For these CGUs, the Directors believe it is appropriate to use forecasts extending beyond five years as they correlate with our experience in similar markets.

Of the other CGUs only the Canadian CGU had a forecast period over five years.
It had a forecast period of six years.
For all CGUs, the value-in-use exceeds of the carrying value of the CGU.
As a result, no impairments were required either in the current or prior year.
Sensitivity analysis The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for each CGU.
This included reducing the anticipated future cash flows and increasing the discount rates.
With the exception of the Australian & New Zealand and Mexican CGUs, no reasonably expected change in the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations would give rise to an impairment charge.
When sensitising each CGUs cash flows, a downside cash flow forecast is prepared by reducing the cash flows in each year of the forecast rather than reducing the cash flows by a set percentage.
The above disclosure shows the decline of the forecasted cash flows in the final year of the forecast, before long-term growth rates are applied.
The sensitised discount rate of 13.8 per cent applied to the ANZ CGU would result in an impairment of 17.4 million.
In order for no impairment to occur, the sensitised discount rate would need to be 13.3 per cent, or lower.
The sensitised discount rate applied to the MX CGU does not result in an impairment.
The sensitised cash flows applied in ANZ and MX would result in impairments of 109.5 million and 17.0million, respectively.
In order for no impairment to occur, the sensitised cash flows would need to be 30.8 per cent and 54.1 per cent, respectively, lower than the base case cash flow in year five for ANZ and year eight for MX, or less.

As at 31 December 2016 the cash and cash equivalents also included 0.1 million held in escrow.
The carrying amounts of all financial instruments equal their fair value.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities were as follows: Assets as at 31 December Liabilities as at 31 December 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Euros 36.0 30.4 32.1 25.1 Canadian dollars 12.7 6.9 49.3 3.8 Danish kroner 7.2 9.0 17.0 15.3 Swiss francs 6.4 1.9 3.1 0.9 Australian dollars 320.1 258.4 13.0 4.4 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is primarily exposed to the Euro, the Australian dollar, the Danish krone and the Canadian dollar.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 per cent depreciation and 10 per cent appreciation inpound sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10 per cent is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency-denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10 per cent change inforeign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016 118 Financial statements 35.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date.
For assets and floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of asset liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 10 per cent increase or decrease inthe interest rate is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 10 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2016 would increase by 3,000 2015: 49,000 : and there would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its major counterparties are continuously monitored.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of consumers, spread across geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which are stated net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements areheld.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
In December 2016, the Group signed a 200 million revolving credit facility which expires in March 2020.
Thefacility is unsecured and contains common financial covenants for the Company and its subsidiaries that theratio of total net debt to Underlying EBITDA must not exceed 3.0, interest cover ratio of Underlying EBITDA to net finance charges must not be less than 4.0, and any new earn-out deferred consideration must not exceed one times the Underlying EBITDA.
The financial covenants are tested on a quarterly basis and have been complied with at all measurement points.
No amounts had been drawn during the year.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods.
The tables are based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The members of these companies have not required them to obtain an audit of their financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
All entities are incorporated and have the same year end reporting date, with the exception of IF-JE Participaes Ltda.
and its subsidiaries, which have a 31 March yearend.
For all entities, the proportion of voting rights held equated to the proportion of ownership interests held.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 124 Financial statements 38.
Events after the balance sheet date There have been no significant adjusting or non-adjusting events since the balance sheet date.
Summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company andentities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power togovern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: through currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align with the Group accounting policies.
All intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated uponconsolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, totheParent Company and are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from equity attributable to owners of the Parent.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed tothenon-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
b Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition ismeasured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or atthe proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The Groups acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred and included within exceptional items.
Acquisition costs paid on behalf of the vendor are included in the fair value of consideration transferred.
When the consideration for the acquisition includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred in the business combination.
Where the contingent amount is dependent on future employment, it is recognised as an expense over the relevant period in the income statement.
Changes inthe fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify asmeasurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability isre-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition andMeasurement or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously held interests in the acquired entity are re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group obtains control and the resulting gain orloss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
com 125 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2016 39.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued b Business combinations and goodwill continued The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for certain items which are measured in accordance with the relevant IFRS.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period.
Additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is obtained theacquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equityinterest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units CGUs expected to benefit from thesynergies of the combination.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, ormore frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of thecarrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in asubsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit orloss on disposal.
c Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except for when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost.
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
The Consolidated Income Statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of the associate.
Anychange in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Groups other comprehensive income.
In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the Consolidated Statement of Changes inEquity.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value in accordance with IAS 39.
Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.
In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised inother comprehensive income in relation to that associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
The aggregate amounts of current and non-current assets and liabilities, revenues and profit before tax aredisclosed in Note 16.
Where applicable, the aggregate amount of capital commitments and contingent liabilities are also disclosed.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 126 Financial statements 39.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued d Fair value measurement The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The Directors consider the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate to their fair values.
The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 35.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement isdirectly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement isunobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
e Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and also the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences on monetary items receivable or payable to a foreign operation where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.
On the disposal of a foreign operation i. e. a disposal of the Groups entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Exchange differences arising are recognised inother comprehensive income.
com 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2016 39.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued f Revenue recognition Revenues are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group andthe revenues can be reliably measured.
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration net ofdiscounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
The following criteria must also be met before revenues are recognised: Commission Commission revenues earned from restaurants are earned and recognised at the point of order fulfilment to the restaurants consumers.
Payment card and administration fees Revenues from payment card and administration fees are recognised when the service is completed, in line with the revenues recognised on commissions.
This is the point at which an order is successfully processed and the Group has no remaining transactional obligations.
Top-placement fees Revenues from top-placement fees are recognised over the period in which the service is rendered.
Connection fees Our Restaurant Partners pay a one-off fee to join the Just Eat network, which is comprised of an equipment feeand a connection fee.
The equipment provided is an order confirmation terminal situated at restaurant sitesfor the purposes of communicating between end user consumers and restaurants via the central Just Eat ordering infrastructure.
Equipment fees are deferred to the balance sheet and recognised on a straight-line basis over 36 months.
This is considered to be an appropriate time period as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the equipment.
The equipment connection fee revenues are payable on connection but deferred and recognised on astraight-line basis over 12 months.
In addition, our Danish and French based Restaurant Partners pay an annual subscription fee.
Revenues inrespect of subscription fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the annual subscription period.
Other revenues Other revenues include the sale of branded merchandise to our Restaurant Partners.
Merchandise revenues are recognised when the goods are delivered and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the restaurant.
Other revenues also include discounts and vouchers.
g Operating profit or loss Operating profit or loss is stated after charging for long-term employee incentive provisions, exceptional items andforeign exchange gains and losses, but before other gains and losses, finance income and finance costs.
h Exceptional items Exceptional items are costs such as M&A transaction and integration costs or credits that, by virtue of their nature and incidence, have been disclosed separately in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial statements.
i Other gains and losses Other gains and losses are comprised of profits or losses arising on the disposal or deemed disposal of operations, gains and losses on financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, and movements on provisions for obligations to acquire minority interests.
They have been disclosed separately in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial statements and are not disclosed within operating profit as they are non-trading in nature.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 128 Financial statements 39.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued j Leasing The Group as lessee Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group did not have any finance leases in either 2016 or 2015.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
k Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
l Taxation The income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Please see Note 40 in respect ofthe accounting for uncertain tax provisions.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates prevailing in each respective jurisdiction and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement ofthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax deductions on the exercise of share options Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, to the extent that the tax deduction available on the exercise of share options is equal to, or is less than, the cumulative share based payment charge calculated under IFRS 2, current and deferred tax is recognised through the income statement.
However, when the tax deduction is greater than the cumulative expense, the incremental current tax deduction and deferred tax recognition are recognised in equity.
com 129 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2016 39.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued m Intangible assets other than goodwill The Group has four classes of intangible asset: patents, licences and intellectual property IP, restaurant contracts, brands and development costs.
Due to both the absence of a contractual arrangement and a practice of establishing such contracts with consumers, acquired consumer user lists are not classified as an intangible asset and remain as part of goodwill.
Patents, licences and IP Patents, licences and IP are included at cost and amortised in equal annual instalments over their useful economic life, which is typically three to five years depending on the period over which benefits are expected to be realised from the asset.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Restaurant contracts Restaurant contract intangible assets are recorded as part of a business combination: or when an associate is acquired: or when a joint venture is established.
They are initially recorded at fair value and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset on a straight-line basis.
This period of time is the period over which the acquired restaurant contracts are reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits to the Group, which is usually between three and ten years.
The fair values of restaurant contracts are determined with reference to the present value oftheir after tax cash flows projected over their remaining useful lives.
Thecash flows and discount rates used inthe valuations are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.
Brands Brand intangible assets are recorded as part of a business combination: when an associate is acquired: or when ajoint venture is established.
They are initially recorded at fair value and amortised over the useful economic life ofthe asset on a straight-line basis, which is usually between three and ten years.
This period oftime is the period over which the acquired brand is reasonably expected to transfer economic benefits to the Group.
The fair values ofbrand assets are established using the relief from royalty valuation method.
Thecash flows and discount rates used in the relief from royalty valuation model are risk adjusted to the extent deemed necessary to accurately reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.
Development costs Internally developed websites, apps and other software that together comprise the Just Eat ordering platforms, are capitalised to the extent that costs can be separately identified, the product is technically feasible, expenditure can be measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project.
Development costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life ofthe respective product, which is usually three years.
Where these conditions are not met the amounts are expensed as incurred.
n Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and fittings 33 p er cent per annum Equipment 33 per cent per annum Leasehold improvements 20 per cent per annum or the period of the lease if shorter Annual Report & Accounts 2016 130 Financial statements 39.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued o Impairment of assets excluding goodwill Under IFRS, the Group is required to review for impairment when indicators of impairment exist.
On these occasions, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
p Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
q Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated using the first-in first-out method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
r Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and credit card cash received on behalf of Restaurant Partners.
s Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities The Group fide-recognises a financial asset or liability only when the contractual right that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
t Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
Hedges of foreign currency exchange risk where there is a firm commitment of a cash inflow or outflow are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Note 35 sets out details of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued t Hedge accounting continued Fair value hedges The Group did not designate any hedges as fair value hedges during the current or prior years.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of other reserves.
Thegain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included inother gains and losses.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
u Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised in the income statement within finance expense.
v Share based payments Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value includes the effect of market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair values of equity-settled share based transactions are set out in Note 34.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve.
w Dividends Dividends payable to the holders of the Companys Ordinary Shares and are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 39, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates which are dealt with separately below, are those which management has made in applying the Groups accounting policies and have the most significant effect on the financial statements.
a Revenue recognition Revenues derived from connection fees include both a connection fee and an equipment fee.
Equipment fee revenues are deferred to the balance sheet and recognised on a straight-line basis over 36 months.
Judgement is applied in determining the period over which the equipment fee revenues arerecognised.
The connection fee revenues are payable on connection but deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over 12 months.
12 months is considered to be the required period of service.
Judgement is applied in determining the period over which the connection fee is earned.
b Share based payments The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Estimating fair value for share based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.
Judgements are applied in relation to estimations of the number of options that will vest and of the fair value of the options granted to employees.
Estimates of fair value are made using a widely recognised share option value model and are referred to third-party experts where necessary.
Judgement is applied in determining the assumptions input into the share option value model.
See Note 34 for details of the key assumptions used.
c Deferred taxation The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
To determine the future taxable profits, reference is made to the latest available profit forecasts.
Where the temporary differences are related to losses, relevant tax law is considered to determine the availability of the losses to offset against the future taxable profits.
Recognition of deferred tax assets therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Details of the recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are included in Note 18. www.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Key sources of estimation uncertainty Discussed below are the key assumptions regarding the future and other key sources of estimated uncertainty atthe balance sheet date which may have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
d Acquired intangible assets An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, it is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The identification of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations requires judgement.
For each business combination the balance of goodwill to other intangible assets is reviewed for appropriateness.
Acquired intangible assets, comprising brands, restaurant contracts and intellectual property, are amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives of between three and ten years.
Significant judgement is required in determining the fair value and economic livesof acquired intangible assets.
External valuations are obtained for significant acquisitions.
Details of the intangible assets recognised on acquisition, during the year, are disclosed in Note 31. e Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The Groups balance sheet includes significant goodwill and other intangible assets.
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use.
Determining whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which the asset has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model.
The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next three years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group isnot yet committed to, or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for the period beyond the three budgets.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in Note 13. f Fair value measurement and valuation process Some of the Groups assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, particularly intangible assets acquired through acquisition and deferred contingent consideration.
In estimating fair value, the Group uses market observable and deferred contingent consideration data where available.
Where market observable and deferred contingent consideration data is not available, recognised valuation methodologies are used.
g Taxation The Groups tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges arising in each jurisdiction.
As a result of the Groups growing global footprint, the changing global tax environment and income taxes arising in numerous jurisdictions, there are some transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process.
Resolving tax issues can take several years and is not always within the control of the Group.
Current tax liabilities are recognised for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority.
These may be, for example, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued.
Liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions are measured based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax law and assigning probabilities to the possible likely outcomes and range of taxes payable in order to ascertain a weighted average probable liability.
In-house tax experts, professional firms and previous experience are used to help assess the tax risks when determining and recognising such liabilities.
See Note 11 for further details.
Where the final amounts payable are different to the liabilities recognised in previous periods the required adjustments in respect of prior years are recorded in the current period in the income statement, or directly toequity, as appropriate.
