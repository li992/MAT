Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in Sterling and rounded to 0.1 million.
They are prepared on a going concern basis, as referred to in the Strategic Report on page 24, and on the historical cost basis except certain financial instruments detailed below.
Estimates and judgements The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable, under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The significant judgements made in the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 were in relation to pensions note 8, goodwill note 12, inventories note 17 and taxation note 9 and note 22.
Further details on the application of these judgements can be found in the relevant notes.
Statement of compliance The Group Accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use by the EU.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing Group Accounts.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with the jointly controlled entity are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains.
Foreign currency Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and of related qualifying hedges are taken directly to equity.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
The elective exemption in IFRS 1 means that any translation differences prior to the date of transition 1 April 2004 do not need to be analysed retrospectively and so the deemed cumulative translation differences at this date can be set to nil.
Thus, any cumulative translation differences arising prior to the date of transition are excluded from any future profit or loss on disposal of any entities.
The Group adopted this exemption.
88 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 1 Basis of preparation continued Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.

The Group has a legal right of offset for all single currency cash pools in operation and has the intent to net settle these pools, which will be demonstrated at reporting periods going forward, in line with new guidance.
As the Group does not intend to do this for its multi-currency pools, the accounting policy has been revised and these have been presented as gross.
The balance sheets as at 31 March 2014 and 2015 have been restated to reflect this treatment refer to note 21 on pages 110 to 121 for more detail.

During the year, the Group has reorganised its operating segments, which are now organised into five operating hubs and one segment of central costs.
These hubs are: Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Asia Pacific APAC and Emerging Markets, and North America.
Each segment is comprised of a hub market with one or more associated local markets Northern Europes hub is the UK, with associated local markets in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Republic of Ireland.
Southern Europes hub is France, with associated local markets in Italy, Spain and Portugal.
Central Europes hub is Germany, with associated local markets in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
North Americas hub is the United States of America, with an associated local market in Canada.
Asia Pacific and Emerging Markets has a hub in Hong Kong and local markets in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Peoples Republic of China, South Korea, Chile, South Africa and exports to distributors where the Group does not have a local operating company.
Each reporting segment derives its revenue from the high service level distribution of Industrial and Electronics products.
Intersegment pricing is determined on an arms length basis, comprising sales of product at cost and a handling charge included within distribution and marketing expenses.

7 Share-based payments Employee benefits Share-based payment transactions The Group operates several share-based payment schemes, the largest of which are the Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Recruitment Award and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
Details of these are provided below.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed with a corresponding increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair values are calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The income statement charge is then adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting based on non market performance related criteria.
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
Central costs and distribution and marketing expenses include the cost of the share-based payment schemes.
Shares in the Company, held by the trust established to administer the schemes, are shown within reserves.
The total charge included in the Income Statement in the year was 3.0 million 2015: 2.0 million.
Of the total charge 2.9 million 2015: 1.5 million related to equity-settled share schemes and 0.1 million 2015: 0.5 million related to cash-settled share schemes.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan Under the Companys DSBP, conditional awards of shares are made to plan participants to the value of 50% of their cash bonus.
The award vests after two years, normally subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There are no other performance conditions.
A cash payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the shares will be made to the participants on vesting.
During the year a total of 58,680 shares 2015: 214,958 were conditionally awarded to the schemes participants.
Deferred shares relating to the bonus awards to senior managers for the year ended 31 March 2016 will be awarded in June 2016.

At the vesting date the share award will either vest, in full or in part, or lapse.
The awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents on vesting.
The terms and conditions of the LTIP are such that the vesting conditions are based on both the performance of the Group versus the FTSE 250 and growth in Earnings Per Share over the life of the scheme.
The fair value of LTIP options was calculated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo model based on the assumptions below.

Save As You Earn Schemes The SAYE schemes are available to the majority of employees of the Group.
The option price is based on the average market price of the Companys shares over the three days prior to the offer, discounted by 20%.
The option exercise conditions are the employees continued employment for a three year period and the maintenance of employees regular monthly savings.
Failure of either of these conditions is normally deemed a forfeiture of the option.
At the end of the period the employee has six months to either purchase the shares at the agreed price, or withdraw their savings with the accrued interest.
There are no market conditions to the vesting of the options.

96 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 8 Pension schemes Employee benefits Pension costs In the UK the Group operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for eligible employees who joined on or before 1 April 2003.
The scheme is administered by a corporate trustee and the funds are independent of the Groups finances.
In addition there are material defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and the Republic of Ireland, and other retirement indemnity schemes in France and Italy.
For UK employees who joined after 1 April 2003 the Group provides a defined contribution pension scheme.
There are also defined contribution schemes in Australia, North America, Germany and the Republic of Ireland, and government schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The cost of the defined benefit scheme charged to the income statement comprises: service cost, net interest cost and administrative expenses and taxes.
The Group has elected to adopt the amendment to IAS 19 revised, which allows actuarial gains and losses to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income immediately.
Obligations are measured at present value using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate reflecting yields on high quality corporate bonds.
Assets are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
The funding of the UK defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The net UK pension cost for the year ended 31 March 2016 amounted to 6.5 million 2015: 14.5 million credit.
The contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 6.9 million 2015: 5.2 million The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks.
For the UK scheme, following consultation with the Company, the Trustees have adopted an investment policy to mitigate some of these risks.
In particular, the scheme holds leveraged matching funds which offset some interest and inflation rate risks in respect of pensioner liabilities.
The rules of the UK Electrocomponents Group Pension scheme give the Trustee powers to wind up the scheme, which it may exercise if the Trustee is aware that the assets of the scheme are insufficient to meet its liabilities.
Although the scheme is currently in deficit on a statutory funding basis, the Trustee and the Company have agreed a plan to eliminate the deficit over time and the Trustee has confirmed as at 7 April 2016 that it has no current intention of exercising its power to wind up the scheme.
The costs of the defined benefit pension scheme in Germany and Republic of Ireland were 0.1 million 2015: 0.3 million.
The costs of the defined contribution schemes in Australia, North America, Germany and Republic of Ireland were 2.1 million 2015: 3.0 million, and those via government retirement indemnity schemes in France, Italy, Scandinavia and North Asia were 1.9 million 2015: 2.2 million.
The Group expects to pay 10.4 million to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2016 17.
The principal assumptions used in the valuations of the liabilities of the Groups material schemes were: 2016 2015 2016 2016 Republic 2015 2015 Republic UK Germany of Ireland UK Germany of Ireland Discount rate 3.60% 2.30% 2.30% 3.30% 1.60% 1.60% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries Nil 2.00% n a Nil 2.50% n a Rate of RPI price inflation 2.90% 1.75% 1.75% 2.90% 1.75% 1.75% Rate of CPI price inflation 2.10% 1.75% 1.75% 2.10% 1.75% 1.75% Rate of pension increases RPI inflation capped at 5% p. a 2.85% n a n a 2.85% n a n a RPI inflation capped at 2.5% p. a 2.10% n a n a 2.10% n a n a The assumption on the rate of increase of pensionable salaries in the UK scheme has been restricted.
This is due to the introduction of salary capping entitlement arrangements with respect to the defined benefit pension scheme in June 2008. www.

Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 assumptions The following analysis estimates the impact of various assumption changes on the UK defined benefit pension obligation.
Effect on obligation of a 0.1% increase to the assumed discount rate Liabilities reduce by 10.9m Effect on obligation of a 0.1% increase in the assumed inflation rate Liabilities increase by 9.9m Effect on obligation of an assumed increase in one years life expectancy Liabilities increase by 13.9m The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, in practice changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
9 Income tax expense Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes are likely to be due.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these temporary differences can be utilised.

12 Intangible assets Goodwill and other intangibles Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 31 March 1998 has been written off against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 has been capitalised and, under UK GAAP, was amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, with a maximum of 20 years.
The Group has made the elective exemption under IFRS 1 that allows goodwill in respect of acquisitions made prior to 1 April 2004 to remain as stated under UK GAAP.
The balance of goodwill as at 1 April 2004 is deemed to be the cost going forward.
Goodwill is not amortised under IFRS.
Instead the carrying value is reviewed annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
The cost of acquired intangible assets are their purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of the asset on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Trademarks 5% Computer software costs 10% 50% Amortisation is disclosed in distribution and marketing expenses in the income statement.
The residual value, if significant, is reassessed annually.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups goodwill are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such an indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of fair value less cost of sale and value in use.
The present value of estimated future cash flows is calculated using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The value of internally generated intangible asset additions in the year was 10.4 million 2015: 9.6 million.
Value in use calculations The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use discounted cash flow projections based on actual operating results together with management projections for three years.
These cash flows are based on extrapolations from earlier budgets and forecasts.
These are subject to assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions: for example by examining the causes of differences between past cash flow projections and actual cash flows.
Cash flows for further periods, i. e. beyond three years, are extrapolated using a long-term annual growth rate of 1.9% 2015: 2.0% which is consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rate for the distribution industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12.3% 2015: 12.7% has been applied in calculating the discounted projected cash flows.
com Electrocomponents plc 103 Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 12 Intangible assets continued Key assumptions The key assumptions used are the sales growth rate and discount rate.
The sales growth rate is prepared using internal forecasts based upon historical growth rates and future medium term plans together with relevant macro economic indicators.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the prudent market estimate long-term average growth rates for the industry and do not exceed expected long term GDP growth.
The discount rate is based upon the Groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC as at 31 March 2016 and has been calculated reflecting market assessments at that time.
The Directors believe that currently all reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions referred to above would not give rise to an impairment charge.
Outcome of calculations The recoverable amount of the Allied Electronics Inc. cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value and the carrying value of the goodwill is therefore not impaired.
13 Property, plant and equipment Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and certain direct overheads.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Each finance leased asset is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease less accumulated depreciation.
No depreciation has been charged on freehold land.
Other assets have been depreciated to residual value, on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Freehold and leasehold buildings 2% Plant and machinery 10% 20% Computer equipment 20% 33% Other office equipment 20% Depreciation is disclosed in distribution and marketing expenses in the income statement.

21 Financial instruments Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
It principally employs forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in exchange rates over fixed terms of between three and six months of the majority of its operating companies.
In addition there are also a number of interest rate swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into floating rate.
In accordance with its treasury policies, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: Cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a forecast transaction.
Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Net investment hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
All the Groups derivatives are initially and in subsequent periods recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
110 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 21 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedge accounting Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the non-financial asset or liability.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss that was recognised directly in equity is reclassified into the income statement in the same period during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the difference between their discounted contractual forward price and their current forward price.
Fair value hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to interest rate and exchange rate risks arising from financing activities, holding a small number of interest rate and cross currency swaps which swap certain fixed rate loans into floating rate or into fixed rate loans in the relevant currency.
The fair value of the swaps is the market value of the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates.
The market value of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the income statement.
All debts not accounted for under fair value hedge accounting are held at amortised cost.

Estimation of fair values The fair values reflected in the table above have been determined by reference to available market information at the balance sheet date and using the methodologies described below.
A Derivative financial assets and liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices.
Level 2 as defined by IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
B Interest-bearing loans held at fair value Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
C Loans designated under fair value hedge relationships Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves and valuing any amounts denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
D Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts, Interest-bearing loans held at amortised cost Cash and cash equivalents largely comprise local bank account balances, which typically bear interest at rates set by reference to local applicable rates or cash float balances which have not yet cleared for interest purposes.
Fair values are estimated to equate to carrying amounts as their re-pricing maturity is less than one year.
Interest bearing loans held at amortised cost comprise fixed rate sterling and foreign currency denominated loans.
For carrying values the foreign currency principal amounts have been valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and are all unsecured.
They bear interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
E Finance lease liabilities Fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
114 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 21 Financial instruments continued F Other financial assets and liabilities Fair values of receivables and payables are determined by discounting future cash flows.
For amounts with a repricing maturity of less than one year, fair value is assumed to approximate to the carrying amount.
Cash pooling The Group operates legal arrangements whereby cash balances and overdrafts held with the same bank are offset to give a net balance which is included within cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
These cash and bank overdraft figures before netting are shown in the tables below: Gross amounts Gross Net before amounts amounts offsetting set off presented 31 March 2016 Cash at bank and in hand 351.3 317.0 34.3 Bank overdrafts 343.0 317.0 26.0 Total 8.3 8.3 31 March 2015 as restated Cash at bank and in hand 310.1 277.9 32.2 Bank overdrafts 311.0 277.9 33.1 Total 0.9 0.9 31 March 2014 as restated Cash at bank and in hand 213.1 175.7 37.4 Bank overdrafts 228.3 175.7 52.6 Total 15.2 15.2 Restated for the change in accounting policy relating to the grossing up of multi-currency cash pools.
Risk management objectives and policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, market and credit.
Each of these are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
The policies are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Groups key priority is to ensure that it can meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group ensures this by having sufficient committed debt facilities in place to meet its anticipated funding requirements.
The Groups forecast funding requirements and its committed debt facilities are reported to and monitored by the Treasury Committee monthly.
As at 31 March 2016 the Group had the following committed debt finance in place: Private Placement loan notes of $185 million with maturities of June 2017 $85 million and June 2020 $100 million.
A syndicated multicurrency facility for $75 million, 85 million and 50 million with a maturity of August 2019: As at 31 March 2016, the Group had available 123.1 million of undrawn committed debt facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Group also uses bank overdrafts, uncommitted short term money market loans, cash and short term investments.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups day to day funding and liquidity requirements.

116 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 21 Financial instruments continued Market risk Foreign currency transactional risk The Group has foreign currency transactional risk resulting from trade payables, and receivables in various currencies, and debt in USD.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk because most operating companies have some level of payables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Some operating companies also have receivables in currencies other than their functional currency.
Hedging of currency exposures during periods when operating companies cannot easily change their selling prices is implemented in order to shelter the forecast gross profits during those periods.
In this way the impacts of currency fluctuations can be smoothed until selling prices can be changed in the light of movements in exchange rates.
The hedges are enacted through forward foreign currency contracts entered into by Group Treasury based on trading projections provided by the operating companies.
The Groups largest exposures relate to Euros and US Dollars.
As at 31 March 2016, net forecasted exposures in Euros and US Dollars for the first six months Euros and first three months US Dollars of the year ending 31 March 2017 were 100% hedged.
In addition specific cash flows relating to material transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the local business are hedged when the commitment is made.
The Group classifies forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments against forecast receivables payables and designates them as cashflow hedges for accounting purposes.
The forecast cashflows are expected to occur evenly throughout the period for 12 months from the year end, and will affect the income statement in the period in which they occur.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts not used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 March 2016 was 0.2 million 2015 : nil.
These contracts at 31 March 2016 have been used to hedge inter company loans.
Foreign currency transaction exposures, and the hedges in place to mitigate them, are monitored monthly by the Treasury Committee.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency transactional risk has materially altered during the year.
In June 2010 the Group issued $85 million of Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with maturities in June 2017.
As at 31 March 2016 using cross currency interest rate swaps both contracted and bifurcated, this debt was swapped into Sterling at a floating interest rate.
In June 2015 the Group issued a further $100 million of Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, maturing in June 2020.
Using cross currency interest rate swaps, $20 million of this debt was swapped, at a floating interest rate.
$105 million of the Private Placement loan notes, and associated swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, and are expected to remain highly effective over the life of the Private Placement loan notes.
Foreign currency translational risk The Group has foreign currency translational risk resulting from investment in US and European subsidiaries.
The Group has designated $80 million of the Private Placement loan notes, overdrafts of $30 million, and cross currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments within net investment hedges against its investments in its US and European subsidiaries.
The carrying value of these $ and hedges remained highly effective, throughout the year ended 31 March 2016.
A foreign exchange loss of 2.8 million 2015: loss of 5.0 million was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to sterling in the year ended 31 March 2016.
No other foreign currency translation exposures are explicitly hedged although local currency debt is used where economic and fiscally efficient in the financing of subsidiaries and this provides a degree of natural hedging.
Guidelines are in place to manage the currency mix of the Groups net debt.
The Group does not believe its foreign currency translational risk has materially altered during the year.
com Electrocomponents plc 117 Stock Code: ECM Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 21 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group has relatively high interest cover and therefore the Group adopts a policy of paying and receiving most of its interest on a variable interest rate basis, as in the opinion of the Group this minimises interest cost over time.
This policy is subject to regular monitoring of the effect of potential changes in interest rates on its interest cost with a view to taking suitable actions should exposure reach certain levels.
The Group does not believe its interest rate risk has materially altered during the year.
As at 31 March 2016 the Group had: Left $80 million of its Private Placement loan notes fixed until June 2020 and swapped $20 million to sterling at a fixed interest rate.
Swapped $85 million of its Private Placement loan notes from $ fixed to floating $45 million and floating $40 million using interest rate swaps.
These are designated as fair value hedges and net investment hedges.
All other borrowings were at a variable rate.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair market value: Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and: Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.

The amounts in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date, as exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties, customers and geographic locations.
As such the Group does not believe its credit risk has materially altered during the year.
The Group identifies counterparties of suitable creditworthiness based on ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and has procedures to ensure that only these parties are used, that exposure limits are set based on the external credit ratings, and that these limits are not exceeded.
120 24604.04-AR16-Proof2 Financial Statements 21 Financial instruments continued Trade and other receivables All operating companies have credit policies and monitor their credit exposure on an ongoing basis.
Each operating company performs credit evaluations on all customers seeking credit over a certain amount.
Trade receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by local management based on prior experience of customers and assessment of their current economic environment.
There are no significant individual allowances for doubtful receivables included within this amount.
For countries with no local operating company presence export credit limits are set and monitored on a country basis monthly by the Treasury Committee.
Given the profile of our customers, whereby credit risk is spread amongst a large number of customers with small balances, no further material credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2016 2015 m m Northern Europe 69.5 66.9 Southern Europe 58.4 48.9 Central Europe 23.6 20.8 Europe 151.5 136.6 APAC and Emerging Markets 21.0 21.8 North America 40.4 38.5 212.9 196.9 The aging of net trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2016 2015 m m Not past due 143.4 136.5 Past due 0-60 days 59.1 53.9 Past due 60-120 days 5.2 3.9 Past due 120 days 5.2 2.6 212.9 196.9 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of loans and receivables during the year was as follows: 2016 2015 m m Balance at 1 April 4.4 5.0 Loss gain recognised 0.9 0.6 Balance at 31 March 5.3 4.4 Capital management The Boards policy is to always maintain a strong capital base, with an appropriate debt to equity mix, to ensure investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on capital, which the Group defines as operating profit as a percentage of net assets plus net debt, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Group seeks to raise debt from a variety of sources and with a variety of maturities.
As at 31 March 2016 the Group had a Revolving Credit Facility of 85 million, $75 million and 50 million with a maturity of August 2019 and $185 million of US Private Placement loan notes, of which $85 million is due in 2017 and $100 million is due in 2020.
The Groups debt covenants are EBITA : Interest to be greater than 3:1 and Net Debt: EBITDA to be less than 3.25:1.
At the year end the Group comfortably met these covenants.
There were no significant changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
