TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers, requiring them to pay in advance of their storage period and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that these customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between one week to four weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 353,000 2015: 210,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The average age of these receivables is 19 days past due 2015: 43 days past due.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables 2016 2015 000 000 1 30 days 285 44 30 60 days 45 33 60 days 23 133 Total 353 210 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2016 2015 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 19 42 Amounts provided in year 76 99 Amounts written off as uncollectible 84 122 Balance at the end of the year 11 19 The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables and accruals and deferred income approximates fair value.
