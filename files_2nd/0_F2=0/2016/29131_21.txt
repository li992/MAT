The cost of past service benefits which have vested are charged against revenue as they arise.
Where such benefits have not vested, costs are accrued until vesting occurs.

Financial instruments continued Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the inside front cover.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets and a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
The main risks include investment and market price risk comprising foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors approach to the management of these risks is set out below.
The Directors of the Company and of S. I. T. Savings Limited coordinate the Companys risk management.
The Companys policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, which are set out below, have not changed from those applied in the previous year.
Investment and market price risk The holding of securities and investing activities involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur which affect the value of investments.
The Company holds a portfolio which is well diversified across industrial and geographical areas to help minimise these risks.
It may also use derivatives.
From time to time, the Company may wish to use derivatives in order to protect against a specific risk or to facilitate a change in investment strategy such as the movement of funds from one area to another.
No such transaction may take place without the prior authorisation of the Board.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 70% of the Companys assets are invested overseas which gives rise to a currency risk.
From time to time, specific hedging transactions are undertaken.
The Companys overseas income is subject to currency movements.
The currency profile of the Companys monetary assets and liabilities is set out below.
Management of the risk Management monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis, and reports to the Board at regular intervals.
Management measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments or the income received from them.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is receivable and its receipt.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at 31 October 2016 and 31 October 2015 are shown below.
US $ Euro Other 2016 000 000 000 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 212 292 1,302 Creditors amounts due to brokers Cash 19,861 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 20,073 292 1,302 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 240,916 111,239 239,941 Total net foreign currency exposure 260,989 111,531 241,243 2015 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 15,776 141 4,959 Creditors amounts due to brokers 10,684 9,848 Cash 33,981 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 39,073 141 4,889 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 198,084 110,635 232,357 Total net foreign currency exposure 237,157 110,776 227,468 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
The maximum and minimum net monetary assets liabilities amounts for each currency were as follows.
indd 55 05 01 2017 08:51 56 | 57 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the shareholders funds in regard to the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities.
It assumes a 10% depreciation of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro at 31 October 2016.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous twelve months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
2016 2015 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 If sterling had weakened by 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Revenue return 557 455 580 473 Capital return 26,078 11,124 23,699 11,064 Return attributable to shareholders 26,635 11,579 24,279 11,537 A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.
c. Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through a combination of investment realisations, retained revenue reserves, debenture stocks and secured bonds.
All debenture stocks and secured bonds are at fixed rates.
Details of interest rates on financial assets are included in note 8 on page 50.
Details of interest rates on financial liabilities are included in note 12 on page 51.
Management of the risk The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which have been approved and are monitored by the Board.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at the year end, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
indd 56 05 01 2017 08:51 | The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Annual Report 2016 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had decreased by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the return attributable to shareholders as shown on the Income Statement would have decreased by the amounts shown in the table below: 2016 2015 000 000 Return attributable to shareholders 5 11 A 5% increase in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
d. Liquidity risk Almost all of the Companys assets comprise listed securities which represent a ready source of funds.
In addition, the Company has access to short-term borrowing facilities.
The maturity profile of the Companys borrowings is included in note 12 on page 51.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not as significant as the other risks as most of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and are readily realisable.
The manager reviews the liquidity of the portfolio when making investment decisions.
e. Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
Cash comprises balances held by banks with a satisfactory credit rating 2015: same.
Management of the risk This risk is managed as follows: by dealing only with brokers and banks which have been approved by the Audit Committee and which have credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and by setting limits on the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time, which are reviewed semi-annually at meetings of the Audit Committee.
f. Capital management policies and procedures The Company carries on its business as a global growth investment trust.
Its objective is to provide investors, over the longer term, with above-average returns through a diversified portfolio of international equities and to achieve dividend growth ahead of UK inflation.
The levels of gearing and gross gearing are monitored closely by the Board and the Manager.
The Company applies a ceiling on gearing of 20%.
While gearing will be employed in a typical range of 0% to 20%, the Company retains the ability to lower equity exposure to a net cash position if deemed appropriate.
The Board, with the assistance of the management, monitors and reviews the structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the planned level of gearing which will take into account the managements view on the market, the need to buy back shares for cancellation and the level of dividends.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the previous year.

Financial instruments continued Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from information other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques not based on observable market data.
