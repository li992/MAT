Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is U. S. Dollars reflecting the primary economic environment in which the Company operates, that being the exploration and production and midstream energy sectors, where most transactions are expected to take place in U. S. Dollars.
The Company has chosen U. S. Dollars as its presentation currency for financial reporting purposes.
Transactions during the year, including purchases and sales of investments, income and expenses are translated into U. S. Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U. S. Dollars are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a currency other than U. S. Dollars are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses on financial instruments classified as at fair value through profit or loss are included in profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as part of the Change in fair value of investments through profit or loss.
Exchange differences on other financial instruments are included in profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as Foreign exchange loss.
Going concern The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered budgeted and projected results of the business, including projected cash flows, and the risks that could impact the Companys liquidity over the next 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Companys Statement of Financial Position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Comprehensive Income when there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Financial assets When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
a Investment at fair value through profit or loss i.
Classification The Company has elected to classify its investment in the Partnership as at fair value through profit or loss.
Measurement Investments made by the Company in the Partnership are measured at fair value.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 iii.
Fair value estimation A summary of the more relevant aspects of IPEV valuations is set out below: Marketable Listed Securities where an active market exists for the security, the value is stated at the bid price on the last trading day in the period.
Marketability discounts are not generally applied unless there is some contractual, governmental or other legally enforceable restriction preventing realisation at the reporting date.
Unlisted Investments are carried at such fair value as the Investment Manager considers appropriate, and as approved or adjusted by the Board, taking into account the performance of each investee company and the exercise of ratchets, options or other incentive schemes.
Methodologies used in arriving at the fair value include prices of recent investment, earnings multiples, net assets, discounted cash flows analysis and industry valuation benchmarks.
Valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions examples include discount rates, forward oil prices, production multiples and multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company such as EBITDA by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions, adjusted for differences between the investment and the referenced comparable.
Privately held investments may also be valued at cost for a period of time not exceeding one year after an acquisition as the best indicator of fair value.
The Company has determined that the fair value of its investment in the Partnership is $1,695 million and is calculated in accordance with applicable IFRS accounting standards and IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
A financial asset is derecognised in whole or in part either: when the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership: or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards and when it no longer has control over the assets or a portion of the asset: or when the contractual right to receive cash flow has expired.
Equity The Companys Ordinary Shares are classified as equity and upon issuance, the fair value of the consideration received is included in equity, net of share issue costs excluding share issue costs of the IPO.
All formation and initial expenses of the Company, including the share issue costs of its IPO, which are otherwise chargeable to equity, have been borne by the Investment Manager.
In the event that the Investment Management Agreement terminates, the Company would become liable for those costs.
For further details please see Note 9.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Finance income Interest income is recognised on a time apportioned basis using the effective interest method.
Expenses Expenses include legal, accounting, auditing and other operating expenses.
They are recognised on an accruals basis in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2016 Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 3.
Critical accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The area involving a high degree of judgement or complexity and where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial Statements has been identified as the risk of misstatement of the valuation of the investment in the Partnership see Note 5.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The Boards determination that no discount or premium should be applied to the net asset value of the Partnership involves a degree of judgement due to the nature of the Partnerships investments and other assets and liabilities see Note 2: Financial assets a iii.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Investment Entities The Company meets the definition of an investment entity on the basis of the following criteria: 1. the Company obtains funds from multiple investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment management services: 2. the Company commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and 3. the Company measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
To determine that the Company meets the definition of an investment entity, further consideration is given to the characteristics of an investment entity that are demonstrated by the Company.
The Company makes its investments through the Partnership in which it is the sole limited partner.
The Board has assessed whether the Company has all the elements of control as prescribed by IFRS 10 in relation to the Companys investment in the Partnership and has concluded that although the Company is the sole limited partner, it does not control the Partnership but instead has significant influence resulting in its classification as a structured entity in accordance with IFRS 12, and accounted as an investment in associate at fair value in accordance with IAS 28.
The Partnership is financed solely by the funds raised in the IPO and Placing and Open Offer of the Company.
Transfer of funds by the Partnership to the Company is determined by the General Partner see Note 10.
The risks associated with the investment in the Partnership are the same as that of the Company, which are further disclosed in Note 11.
The summarised financial information for the investment in the Partnership is disclosed in Note 6, which is prepared on the same basis as the financial information of the Company.
Taxation The Company has made an election to, and currently expects to conduct its activities so as to be treated as a partnership for U. S. federal income tax purposes.
Therefore, the Company expects that it generally will not be liable for U. S. federal income taxes.
Instead, each of the Companys Shareholders who are liable to U. S. taxes will take into account its respective share of the Companys items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its U. S. federal income tax liability as if such shareholder had earned such income directly, even if no cash distributions are made to the shareholder.
The Company is exempt from taxation in Guernsey under the provisions of the Income Tax Exempt Bodies Guernsey Ordinance, 2008 and is charged an annual exemption fee of 1,200.
The Cayman Islands at present impose no taxes on profit, income, capital gains or appreciations in value of the Partnership.
There are also currently no taxes imposed in the Cayman Islands by withholding or otherwise on the Company as a limited partner of the Partnership on profit, income, capital gains or appreciations in respect of its partnership interest nor any taxes on the Company as a limited partner of the Partnership in the nature of estate duty, inheritance or capital transfer tax.
Local taxes may apply at the jurisdictional level on profits arising in operating entity investments.
Further taxes may apply on distributions from such operating entity investments.
Based upon the current commitments and investments in Liberty II, Eagle II, Rock Oil, Fieldwood, Castex 2014, Castex 2005, Three Rivers III, Carrier II, ILX III, and Centennial, the future U. S. tax liability on profits is expected to be in the range of 35 to 41.5 per cent.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 5.
Fair value IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurement by level.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial assets or financial liabilities are categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement, adjusted if necessary.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3 inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Companys only financial instrument carried at fair value is its investment in the Partnership which has been classified within Level 3 as it has unobservable inputs and is not traded.
Amounts classified under Level 3 for the year ended 31 December 2016 was $1,695 million 31 December 2015: $1,345 million.
The fair value of all other financial instruments approximates to their carrying value.
Transfers during the period There have been no transfers between levels during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Any transfers between the levels will be accounted for on the last day of each financial period.
Due to the nature of the investments, they are always expected to be classified under Level 3.
Valuation methodology and process The Directors base the fair value of the investment in the Partnership on the value of its limited partnership capital account received from the General Partner, which is determined on the basis of the fair value of its assets and liabilities, adjusted if necessary, to reflect liquidity, future commitments, and other specific factors of the Partnership and Investment Manager.
This is based on the components within the Partnership, principally the value of the Partnerships investments in addition to cash and short-term money market fixed deposits.
Any fluctuation in the value of the Partnerships investments in addition to cash and short-term money market fixed deposits held will directly impact on the value of the Companys investment in the Partnership.
The Partnerships investments are valued using the techniques described in the Companys valuation policy.
The Investment Managers assessment of fair value of investments held by the Partnership, through Investment Undertakings, is determined in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
When valuing the Partnerships investments, the Investment Manager reviews information provided by the underlying investee companies and other business partners and applies IPEV methodologies, to estimate a fair value as at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, subject to Board approval.
It is the opinion of the Directors, that the IPEV valuation methodology used in deriving a fair value is generally not different from the fair value requirements of IFRS 13.
In the event that there is a difference, the requirements of IFRS 13 override the IPEV requirements.
Initially, acquisitions are valued at the price of recent investment.
Subsequently, and as appropriate, the Investment Manager values the investments on a quarterly basis using common industry valuation techniques, including comparable public market valuation, comparable merger and acquisition transaction valuation and discounted cash flow valuation.
For early stage private investments, Riverstones investment due diligence process includes assumptions about short-term financial results in determining the appropriate purchase price for the investment.
The techniques used in determining the fair value of the Companys investments through the Partnership are selected on an investment by investment basis so as to maximise the use of market based observable inputs.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the valuations of the Companys investments, through the Partnership, are detailed in the Investment Managers Report.

The variety of valuation bases adopted, quality of management information provided by the underlying investee companies and the lack of liquid markets for the investments mean that there are inherent difficulties in determining the fair value of these investments and such difficulties cannot be eliminated.
Therefore the amounts realised on the sale of investments may differ from the fair values reflected in these Financial Statements and the differences may be significant.
The Board approves the valuations performed by the Investment Manager and monitors the range of reasonably possible changes in significant observable inputs on a regular basis.
The Directors have considered whether a discount or premium should be applied to the net asset value of the Partnership.
In view of the investment in the Partnership and the nature of the Partnerships assets, no adjustment to the net asset value of the Partnership has been deemed to be necessary see Note 3.

Market risk Market risk includes price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Price risk The underlying investments held by the Partnership present a potential risk of loss of capital to the Partnership and hence to the Company.
The Company invests through the Partnership.
Price risk arises from uncertainty about future prices of underlying financial investments held by the Partnership, which at year end was $1,777,012.
The Partnership is exposed to a variety of risks which may have an impact on the carrying value of the Companys investment in the Partnership.
The Partnerships risk factors are set out in a i to a iii below.
i Not actively traded The Partnerships investments are not generally traded in an active market but are indirectly exposed to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investments held.
The underlying investments of the Partnership vary as to industry sub-sector, geographic distribution of operations and size, all of which may impact the susceptibility of their valuation to uncertainty.
Although the investments are in the same industry, this risk is managed through careful selection of investments within the specified limits of the investment policy.
The investments are monitored on a regular basis by the Investment Manager.
ii Concentration The Company, through the Partnership, invests in the global energy sector, with a particular focus on businesses that engage in oil and gas exploration and production and midstream investments in that sector.
This means that the Company is exposed to the concentration risk of only making investments in the global energy sector, which concentration risk may further relate to sub-sector, geography, and the relative size of an investment or other factors.
Whilst the Company is subject to the investment and diversification restrictions in its investment policy, within those limits, material concentrations of investments have arisen.
The Board and the Investment Manager monitor the concentration of the investment in the Partnership on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with the investment policy.
iii Liquidity The Companys underlying investments through the Partnership are dynamic in nature.
The Partnership will maintain flexibility in funding by keeping sufficient liquidity in cash and cash equivalents which may be invested on a temporary basis in line with the cash management policy as agreed by the Board from time to time.
As at 31 December 2016, $268 million or 15.8 per cent.
of the Partnerships financial assets were money market fixed deposits and cash balances held on deposit with several, A or higher rated, banks.
All of these assets have maturities of less than one year.
Riverstone Energy Limited Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 b Foreign currency risk The Company has exposure to foreign currency risk due to the payment of some expenses in Pounds Sterling.
Consequently, the Company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U. S. Dollar.
The following tables sets out, in U. S. Dollars, the Companys total exposure to foreign currency risk and the net exposure to foreign currencies of the monetary assets and liabilities: As at 31 December 2016 $ Total Assets $000 $000 $000 Non-current assets Investment in the Partnership 1,695,406 1,695,406 Total non-current assets 1,695,406 1,695,406 Current assets Trade and other receivables 545 545 Cash and cash equivalents 1,801 1,429 3,230 Total current assets 2,346 1,429 3,775 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 215 408 623 Total current liabilities 215 408 623 Total net assets 1,697,537 1,021 1,698,558 As at 31 December 2015 $ Total Assets $000 $000 $000 Non-current assets Investment in the Partnership 1,345,150 1,345,150 Total non-current assets 1,345,150 1,345,150 Current assets Trade and other receivables 683 683 Cash and cash equivalents 544 1,995 2,539 Total current assets 1,227 1,995 3,222 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 289 894 1,183 Total current liabilities 289 894 1,183 Total net assets 1,346,088 1,101 1,347,189 The Directors do not consider that the foreign currency exchange risk at the balance sheet date is significant or material and therefore sensitivity analysis for the foreign currency risk has not been provided.

Financial risk management continued c Interest Rate Risk The Companys exposure to interest rate risk relates to the Companys cash and cash equivalents held through the Partnership.
The Company is subject to risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates.
As at the date of the Statement of Financial Position, the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held on interest bearing fixed deposit accounts at the Partnership.
The Company has no other interest-bearing assets or liabilities as at the reporting date.
As a consequence, the Company is only exposed to variable market interest rate risk.
Management does not expect any significant change in interest rates that would have a material impact on the financial performance of the Company in the near future, therefore sensitivity analysis for the interest rate risk has not been provided.
31 December 31 December 2016 2015 $000 $000 Non-interest bearing Cash and cash equivalents 3,230 2,539 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors.
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company may not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Company adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management and through the preparation of budgets and cash flow forecasts maintains sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations.
In Q1 2016, the Company received a $5.5 million distribution from the Partnership to meet its forecasted liabilities.
In the event of the Company requiring additional funds, it is expected to receive another distribution from the Partnership.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.
The carrying value of the investment in the Partnership as at 31 December 2016 was $1,695 million 31 December 2015: $1,345 million.
Financial assets mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents and investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Companys risk on liquid funds is reduced because it can only deposit monies with institutions with a minimum credit rating of single A.
The Company mitigates its credit risk exposure on its investment at fair value through profit or loss by the exercise of due diligence on the counterparties of the Partnership, its General Partner and the Investment Manager.

The Company may have additional indirect gearing through the operations of the underlying investee companies.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors, as a whole.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Companys performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the Companys Net Asset Value, as calculated under IFRS, and therefore no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in the Financial Statements.
For management purposes, the Company is organised into one main operating segment, which invests in one limited partnership.
All of the Companys income is derived from within Guernsey and the Cayman Islands.
All of the Companys non-current assets are located in the Cayman Islands.
Due to the Companys nature, it has no customers.
