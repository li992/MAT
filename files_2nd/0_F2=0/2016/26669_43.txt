Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Notes For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2016 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2016 2015: 52 weeks ended 3 October 2015 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain items, principally land and buildings, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefits and share-based payments.
The prior period deferred tax balances that were originally presented on a gross basis in the balance sheet have been represented on a net basis to better reflect the offsetting requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes and to be consistent with the current period presentation.
At the time of approving the financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
