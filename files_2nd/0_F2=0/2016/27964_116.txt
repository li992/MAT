OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY INFORMATION Appendix: Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance Measures In the discussion of the Groups reported operating results, alternative performance measures APMs are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management to assess the financial performance or financial health of the Group, or is useful to investors and stakeholders to assess the Groups performance and position.
However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Groups industry.
Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.
Certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted IFRS measure.
Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent IFRS measure.
Below, we have outlined definitions and explanations for the APMs used throughout our investor communications, as well as reconciliations to the closest equivalent IFRS measure where appropriate.
Growth and financial performance measures Adjusted EBITDA Definition Adjusted EBITDA is defined as results of operating activities before depreciation and amortisation, share-based payment expense, fair value gains and losses on share consideration payable, foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on disposals of assets.
These adjustments generally relate to non-cash items which by their nature are volatile or vary significantly based on factors outside the Groups control including foreign exchange rates.
It is also adjusted for exceptional or non-recurring items which are defined as items of income and expense of such size, nature or incidence that, in the view of management, are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and should be disclosed to explain the performance of the Group.
In the current and prior year, these exceptional, non-recurring items include acquisition and restructuring costs, largely relating to the transformational acquisition of the Skrill Group in August 2015.
Explanation of relevance We use adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, in conjunction with other IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures, to assess the underlying operating performance of our Group, and as such we believe that it is both useful and necessary to report adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our investors and stakeholders.
Reconciliation to closest equivalent GAAP measure Please see table on page 148.
Adjusted profit after tax and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share Definition Adjusted profit after tax is defined as reported profit after tax excluding share-based payment expense, fair value gains and losses on share consideration payable, foreign exchange gains and losses, losses on disposals of assets and exceptional or nonrecurring items as explained within the Adjusted EBITDA section above.
It also excludes amortisation of acquired intangibles, and the tax effect of the adjustments set out above.
No adjustments are made to reported fully diluted weighted average number of shares to calculate adjusted fully diluted earnings per share EPS.
Explanation of relevance Adjusted profit after tax is used by management and investors to assess underlying EPS performance excluding the effect of adjusting items made to operating profit, and excluding the distorting effect of non-cash amortisation charges on assets recognised on consolidation in relation to acquisitions.

Tax effect of the above adjustments Group and divisional pro-forma revenue and organic constant currency year-on-year revenue growth Definition Pro-forma revenue is an unaudited measure, relating to historic periods only.
In FY 2015, which included the material acquisition of the Skrill Group, it was stated on an adjusted basis as if we had owned all acquisitions throughout the FY 2015 period prior to their acquisition and throughout all prior comparative periods pro-forma.
This included Skrill, Ukash, Meritus, GMA, and FANS.
Pro-forma constant currency year-on-year revenue growth was then calculated for prior periods by applying prior period foreign exchange rates to current period pro-forma absolute revenue constant currency.
Acquisitions made in the current period have not been as material as in FY 2015.
From 1 January 2016 we have reverted to the more usual definition of organic constant currency year-on-year growth.
This presents growth as if companies acquired on or after 1 January 2016 had been owned during the whole of FY 2016 and FY 2015 only, and uses the same foreign exchange adjustment.
We have not published pro-forma revenue for the current period, and have not restated prior period absolute pro-forma revenue for these new acquisitions.
This means that all pre-2016 published pro-forma growth rates remain the same.
Explanation of relevance Organic constant currency year-on-year revenue growth presents performance on a comparable basis in terms of merger and acquisition activity and foreign exchange rates.
While organic constant currency growth is neither intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure provides useful and necessary information to investors and stakeholders as it provides additional information on underlying growth of the businesses which enables stakeholders to better assess our underlying performance.

Explanation of relevance These services make up a significant proportion of the revenue from the Payment Processing division and relate to the activities of one single customer through a service that is operationally different to the remainder of the Payment Processing division.
We present the underlying growth of the business and the Payment Processing division excluding this customer to clarify the growth profile of the rest of that division.
Reconciliation to closest equivalent IFRS measure As the Major Merchant Asia Gateway relates to the activities of one single customer, for reasons of commercial sensitivity we do not provide a reconciliation of this measure.
Prepaid organic constant currency year-on-year revenue growth excluding the impact of discontinued Ukash territories and services Definition This measure is calculated in the same way as described on page 148, but adjusted to exclude an estimate of the effect of discontinued Ukash territories and services.
Explanation of relevance Ukash was acquired by Skrill in March 2015.
As part of the valuation of this business, the Group took into account its expected withdrawal from certain territories and services that were previously provided by Ukash.
The Ukash business was fully and successfully integrated in H2 2015, and the brand was retired.
However, for the purposes of presenting pro-forma revenue prior to 31 December 2015, in the interests of transparency we included all pre-acquisition Ukash revenues including those that related to discontinued territories and services.
As such, our measure of pro-forma constant currency year-on-year revenue growth was a negative growth figure for H2 2015.
Following feedback from users of the accounts, we have temporarily introduced this measure which excludes the estimated effect of the discontinued Ukash territories and services.
This measure is an estimate only and is not intended to be a substitute for reported growth.
com 149 Appendix: Alternative Performance Measures continued Reconciliation to closest equivalent IFRS measure This figure is an estimate and as it is only a temporary APM a reconciliation has not been provided.
The impact of the estimate was to increase organic and pro-forma constant currency year-on-year divisional growth by 4% and 6% in FY 2016 and FY 2015 respectively.
Group and divisional pro-forma gross margins Definition Pro-forma gross margin is an unaudited measure, relating to historic periods only.
Divisional pro-forma gross margins for FY 2015 have not been re-presented as a result of a change in presentation of intersegment cost of sales in FY 2016, as fully described in the Change in presentation appendix.
Explanation of relevance Pro-forma gross margins are disclosed by management as additional information to provide comparability with FY 2016 reported margins, especially within the Prepaid division where prior to the acquisition of the Skrill Group in August 2015 there was no reported gross margin.
While pro-forma gross margins are neither intended to be a substitute for reported gross margins, nor superior to reported gross margins, we believe that the measure provided useful additional information for investors and stakeholders in the period following the transformational acquisition of Skrill Group.
A reconciliation to reported gross margin is not considered meaningful in this context.
Financial position and cash flow measures Net debt and net debt pro-forma last 12 months adjusted EBITDA Definition Reported net debt includes short and long-term debt excluding deferred finance costs, finance leases, deferred cash consideration payable and contingent cash consideration payable offset by cash and cash equivalents.
Pro-forma last 12 months adjusted EBITDA is relevant to FY 2015 only.
It is defined as for adjusted EBITDA on page 147, and in line with the definition of pro-forma revenue, includes the impact of pre-acquisition adjusted EBITDA in relation to the acquisitions of Skrill, Ukash, Meritus, GMA, and FANS in FY 2015.
For FY 2016, pro-forma last 12 months adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to reported last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, and from FY 2017 onwards the title of this measure will revert to net debt last 12 months adjusted EBITDA.
Explanation of relevance Reported net debt is a non-IFRS figure which sets out the net indebtedness of the Group.
Management believes that reporting net debt last 12 months adjusted EBITDA gives investors and stakeholders an indication of the debt capacity of the Group at the balance sheet date and as such is an important measure of the Groups financial position.
Reported net debt is comparable to net debt for the purposes of covenants.

Free cash flow before payments working capital is a non IFRS figure defined as operating cash flow after operating working capital movements, interest, tax and capital expenditure.
It excludes payments working capital, being cash flows that are not revenue or costs to the Group, constituted by movements in restricted cash balances, cash held as reserves, settlement assets and merchant processing liabilities.
Explanation of relevance Free cash flow is a measure provided by management to demonstrate the cash flow available to the Group for reinvestment or to reduce the net debt position of the Group.

com 151 Appendix: Alternative Performance Measures continued Adjusted free cash conversion before and after payments working capital Definition Adjusted free cash conversion is measured as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted EBIT.
Adjusted free cash flow after payments working capital is calculated as adjusted EBITDA, as defined on page 147, less working capital movements and capex as reported in the IFRS cash flow.
An adjustment is made to reported working capital movements to exclude cost accrual movements associated with non-EBITDA expenses from reported working capital.
Adjusted free cash flow before payments working capital excludes payments working capital movements as reported in the IFRS cash flow.
Adjusted EBIT is defined as adjusted EBITDA less adjusted depreciation and amortisation, as set out on page 147 for adjusted profit after tax.
Explanation of relevance Management believes that adjusted free cash conversion demonstrates our ability to convert our EBIT growth into cash that can be reinvested in the business through investment, returned to shareholders, or used to support our strategic pillar of bold M&A.
Management discloses adjusted free cash conversion both before and after payments working capital, due to the volatility of payments working capital.
Although payments working capital does not relate to our income or expenses, net increases and decreases in payments working capital represent use of shareholder funds and affect the cash and cash equivalents held by the Group.
Reconciliation to closest equivalent IFRS measure A reconciliation is provided to free cash flow, which is derived entirely from IFRS cash flow line items.
