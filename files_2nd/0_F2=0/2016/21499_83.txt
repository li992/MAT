In addition, impairment tests for all assets are performed when there is an indication of impairment.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.
Previously impaired assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal of previous impairment at each reporting date.
Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU.
There were no material reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.
How recoverable amount is calculated The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD and value in use VIU.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units CGUs.
Valuation methods Fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD is an estimate of the amount that a market participant would pay for an asset or CGU, less the cost of disposal.
Fair value for mineral and petroleum assets is generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost, and its eventual disposal where a market participant may take a consistent view.
Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post-tax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset which is compared against the assets carrying value.
178 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 5 Financial Statements 6 Additional information 7 Shareholder information 12 Impairment of non-current assets continued Value in use VIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal.
VIU is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Groups continued use and cannot take into account future development.
These assumptions are different to those used in calculating fair value and consequently the VIU calculation is likely to give a different result usually lower to a fair value calculation.
Impairment of non-current assets excluding goodwill Petroleum What has been recognised?
At 31 December 2015, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$7,184 million US$4,884 million after tax benefit against the carrying value of individual Onshore US CGUs.
There has been no further impairment relating to Onshore US CGUs in the six months to 30 June 2016.
What were the drivers of impairment?
As a result of significant volatility and weaker prices experienced in the oil and gas industry, management adjusted its medium-term and long-term price assumptions and discount rates, which had a significant flow through impact on asset valuations.
How were the valuations calculated?
Using these updated assumptions, valuations of the relevant Onshore US CGUs were calculated using FVLCD methodology, applying discounted cash flow techniques.
The recoverable amount in each instance is equal to its estimated FVLCD.
Future cash flow information is based upon the Groups latest budgets and project economic plans incorporating Level 3 fair value inputs as defined in note 21 Financial risk management.
What were the significant assumptions The valuations are most sensitive to changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, estimated future production volumes and discount rates.
Key judgements and estimates used in determining FVLCD are disclosed below.
and estimates used in the valuations?
Impairment test for goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, as follows: 2016 2015 Cash generating units US$M US$M Onshore US 3,026 3,026 Other 247 248 3,273 3,274 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of previous business combinations, which represent the level at which management will monitor and manage goodwill.
Onshore US goodwill is the most significant goodwill balance and has been tested for impairment after an assessment of the individual CGUs that it comprises.
Onshore US goodwill Carrying value US$3,026 million 2015: $3,026 million.
Impairment test conclusion No impairment charge is required as at 30 June 2016 30 June 2015: $500 million.
The recoverable amount as at 30 June 2016 of Onshore US CGUs was determined to be US$14,967 million 30 June 2015: US$19,793 million.
How did the goodwill arise?
Goodwill arose on the Petrohawk acquisition in August 2011 and is attributable to synergies associated with the Groups US unconventional petroleum assets Onshore US.
This comprises the Permian, Haynesville, Fayetteville, Black Hawk and Hawkville group of CGUs, which includes the Groups natural gas and liquid reserves and resources, production wells and associated infrastructure, including gathering systems and processing facilities in Texas and Louisiana US.
Segment Onshore US is part of the Petroleum reportable segment.
How were the valuations FVLCD methodology using discounted cash flow techniques has been applied in determining the recoverable calculated?
value of the Onshore US business.
Level of fair value hierarchy Calculations are based primarily on Level 3 inputs as defined in note 21 Financial risk management.
Significant assumptions The calculation of FVLCD for Onshore US is most sensitive to changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, and sensitivities production volumes and discount rates.
Key accounting judgements and estimates used in forming the valuations are disclosed below.
The assumptions used are consistent with those underpinning the property, plant and equipment impairment calculations for Onshore US CGUs.
Reasonably possible changes in circumstances may affect significant assumptions and the estimated fair value.
Isolated changes in these significant assumptions could result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount of Onshore US, including goodwill.
These reasonably possible changes include: A production volume decrease of 13.3 per cent from estimates contained in managements long-term plans: A decrease in crude oil prices of 19.2 per cent from prices assumed in the valuations: A decrease in natural gas prices of 37.9 per cent from prices assumed in the valuations.
Crude oil and natural gas price assumptions used in FVLCD impairment testing are within or lower than the range of prices published by market commentators, as set out within the following key judgements and estimates section.
Typically changes in any one of the aforementioned assumptions including operating performance would be accompanied by a change in another assumption which may have an offsetting impact.
Action is usually taken to respond to adverse changes in assumptions to mitigate the impact of any such change.
Other goodwill Goodwill held by other CGUs is US$247 million 2015: US$248 million.
This represents less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2016 2015: less than one per cent.
This goodwill has been allocated across a number of CGUs in different reportable segments.
There was no significant impairment of other goodwill in the year to 30 June 2016 2015: US$ nil.
BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 179 5 Financial Statementscontinued 12 Impairment of non-current assets continued Key judgements and estimates Recoverable amount testing In determining the recoverable amount of assets, in the absence of quoted market prices, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows.
These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty that may be beyond the control of the Group: hence, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will materially alter projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets at each reporting date.
The most significant estimates impacting asset recoverable amount valuations for Onshore US assets, including goodwill are: Crude oil and natural gas prices Crude oil and natural gas prices used in valuations were either lower than or within the following range of prices published by market commentators: 2016 2015 West Texas Intermediate crude oil price US$ bbl 49.00 81.00 57.00 86.00 Henry Hub natural gas price US$ MMBtu 2.74 5.55 3.54 5.80 Oil and gas prices were derived from consensus and long-term views of global supply and demand, built upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.
Prices are adjusted based upon premiums or discounts applied to global price markers based on the nature and quality produced at a field, or to take into account contracted oil and gas prices.
Future production volumes Estimated production volumes were based on detailed data for the fields and took into account development plans for the fields established by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Production volumes are dependent on variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs and the contractual duration of the production leases.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields were computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions established by management.
The production profiles used were consistent with managements long-term plans and the resource volumes approved as part of the Groups process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
Impact of oil and gas Reserves and future anticipated production levels on testing for impairment Production volumes and prices used in estimating FVLCD valuations may not be consistent with those disclosed as proved reserves under SEC regulations in section 6.3.
FVLCD requires the use of assumptions and estimates that a typical market participant would assume, which include having regard to future forecast oil and gas prices and anticipated field production estimates.
This contrasts with SEC requirements to use unweighted 12-month average historical prices for reserve definitions.
Under SEC requirements, certain previously reported proved reserves may temporarily not meet the definition of proved reserves due to the decrease in price experienced in the last 12 months.
This does not preclude these reserves from being reinstated as proved reserves in future periods when prices recover.
Short-term changes in SEC reported oil and gas reserves do not affect the Groups perspective on underlying project valuations due to the long lives of the assets and future forecast prices.
Discount rates A real post-tax discount rate of 6.5 per cent 2015: 5.5 per cent was applied to post-tax cash flows.
The discount rate is derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology and has increased from the prior year due to volatility in oil and gas markets.
