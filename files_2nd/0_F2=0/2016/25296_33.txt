The correction of this item has no impact on the income statement in either the current or prior period, or the internally reported numbers in either year.
In December 2015, the High Court granted a 500m reduction in the Companys share premium account.
This has resulted in 500m being transferred to retained earnings and has increased the distributable reserves of the Company at 31 March 2016 by 500m.
