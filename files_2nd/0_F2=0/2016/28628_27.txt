The goodwill was allocated to the investment management CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are assessed using value-in-use calculations.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board, covering the forthcoming and future years.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that, absent evidence to the contrary, organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins will be in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will not change significantly in the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years based on annual revenue growth for each CGU see table below : as well as the group's expectation of future industry growth rates.
A 10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on the group's assessment of the likely associated duration of client relationships.
The group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is shown in the table below: these are based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The group judges that these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.

Reducing the assumed growth rate for income in the trust and tax Goodwill CGU by one percentage point would reduce the calculated recoverable amount of the CGU to 987,000.

These amounts have been capitalised see note 21.
At 31 December 2015, deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles included 4,389,000 in relation to the purchase of part of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management's London-based private client investment management business.
The final payment of 4,495,000 was made during the year, based on the value of transferred funds under management retained by the group at 31 December 2015.
Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations Deferred and contingent consideration of 1,136,000 2015 restated note 1.4 : 3,908,000 is the present value of amounts payable at end of 2019 in respect of the acquisition of Vision and Castle see note 8.
The group has estimated the size and timing of the amounts payable by taking into account the expected outcome of the conditions attached to the payments.
The group has discounted the amounts payable after one year.
Following the agreement of the net asset value of the acquired businesses, a net asset value payment of 1,563,000 was made in March 2016.
As a result, deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations as at 1 January 2016 has been restated to reflect this measurement period adjustment see note 1.4.
Further payments of 695,000 and 517,000 were made in June 2016 and December 2016 respectively, following the achievement of operational and financial targets.
Legal and compensation During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time-to-time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties both in the UK and overseas.
Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the groups best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties.
Property-related Property-related provisions consist of 2,798,000 in relation to dilapidation provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group 2015: 1,795,000.
Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model.
During the year, provisions have increased by 1,003,000 due to the creation of a provision for the new London office at 8 Finsbury Circus note 9.
Ageing of provisions Provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date 2015: four years, except for property-related provisions of 1,506,000, which are expected to be settled within 20 years of the balance sheet date 2015: 21 years.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 129 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 129 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Long term employee benefits The group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to these schemes during the year was 4,595,000 2015: 4,160,000.
The group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 40,000 2015: 31,000.
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes' beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
On 20 October 2016, the group commenced a consultation with members of the schemes with a view to ceasing future accrual and breaking the link to final salary in both schemes.
The consultation period ended on 31 January 2017.
As the consultation period was ongoing at the year end, the potential outcomes of the consultation were not reflected in the assumptions to measure the liabilities at 31 December 2016 see note 37.
The group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 1,134,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2015: 1,028,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2013 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2013 The next triennial valuation of both schemes will be carried out during 2017, based on 31 December 2016 data, and may result in changes to the funding commitments described below.
The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes' liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: Laurence Keen Scheme Rathbone 1987 Scheme 2016 2015 2016 2015 % % % % Rate of increase of salaries 4.50 4.20 4.50 4.20 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.60 3.50 3.40 3.10 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.50 3.20 3.50 3.20 Discount rate 2.80 4.00 2.80 4.00 Inflation 3.50 3.20 3.50 3.20 Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Prices Index 130 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 130 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 Consolidated financial statements Over the year, the financial assumptions have been amended to reflect changes in market conditions.
Specifically: i. the discount rate has been decreased by 1.2% to reflect a decrease in the yields available on AA-rated corporate bonds at a term consistent with the average duration of the liabilities ii.
the assumed rate of future inflation has been increased by 0.3% to reflect an increase in expectations of long term inflation as implied by changes in the fixed-interest and index-linked gilts market iii.
the assumed rates of salary growth and future increases to pensions in payment have been increased for consistency with the change in the assumed rate of future inflation.
During the year, the group introduced an allowance for 3% of members, with an average age of 52.5 at the time of transferring out, to transfer their benefits out of the scheme each year over the average remaining lifetime of the members.
This reflects an increase in the level of members seen to be transferring out, following changes to tax rules for pension benefits in 2015.
There were no other changes to the demographic assumptions.
The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 20 years 2015: 19 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 24 years 2015: 23 years.
The normal retirement age for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme is 65 60 for certain former directors.
The normal retirement age for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 60 for service prior to 1 July 2009 and 65 thereafter, following the introduction of pension benefits based on Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE from that date.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the S2NA actuarial tables 2015: S2NA tables.
The assumed life expectations on retirement were: 2016 2015 Males Females Males Females aged 60 Retiring today: 29.3 31.5 29.2 31.4 aged 65 24.3 26.5 24.2 26.4 Retiring in 20 years: aged 60 31.8 33.9 31.6 33.8 aged 65 26.6 28.8 26.5 28.6 The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the groups assets in respect of the schemes is as follows.

They require that the assets of the schemes are invested in a diversified portfolio of assets, split between return seeking assets primarily equities and safer assets gilts, index-linked gilts, corporate bonds and other fixed income investments with a switch to a greater percentage of safer assets over time as the schemes mature.
In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2048.
The scheme was also seeking to hedge around 50% of its interest rate and inflation risk by 31 December 2016 using Liability Driven Investment LDI strategies.
The extent to which this was achieved in 2016 will not be known until the triennial valuation is completed during 2017.
In the Laurence Keen Scheme the target date for the 100% allocation to safer assets is 31 December 2040.
The expected asset allocations at 31 December 2016 as set out in the statements of investment principles are as follows.

The value of these investments is expected to increase when the value of the scheme's liabilities increases and vice versa.
They therefore act to reduce the group's exposure to changes in net defined benefit pension obligations arising from changes in interest rates and inflation.
The funds are selected so that their average duration is intended to broadly align with the duration of the scheme's liabilities.
All equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.
The majority of government bonds are issued by governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Germany, all of which are rated AAA, AA or AA, based on credit ratings awarded by Fitch or Moodys as at the balance sheet date.
Other scheme assets comprise commodities and property funds, both of which also have quoted prices in active markets.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 133 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 133 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Long term employee benefits continued The key assumptions affecting the results of the valuation are the discount rate, future inflation, future salary growth, mortality, the rate of members transferring out and the average age at the time of transferring out.
In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme by varying each of these assumptions in isolation whilst leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
For example, in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the discount rate, the actuary has recalculated the defined benefit obligations for each scheme using a discount rate that is 0.5% higher than used for calculating the disclosed figures.
A similar approach has been taken to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to the other key assumptions.
A summary of the sensitivities in respect of the total of the two schemes defined benefit obligations is set out below.
Combined impact on schemes' liabilities Decrease increase Decrease increase '000 % 0.5% increase in: discount rate 28,225 12.1 rate of inflation 7,929 3.4 rate of salary growth 6,213 2.7 1% increase in the rate of members transferring out each year 1,256 0.5 1 year increase to: longevity at 60 8,598 3.7 average age of members at the time of transferring out 1,537 0.7 The total regular contributions made by the group to the Rathbone 1987 Scheme during the year were 2,558,000 2015: 3,176,000 based on 20.3% of pensionable salaries 2015: 20.3%.
Additional lump sum contributions of 2,917,000 were paid in 2016 2015: 3,792,000.
Following the most recent triennial valuations, from 1 January 2015, the group has made regular contributions of 20.3% of pensionable salaries and the group has committed to make an additional contribution to the scheme of 500,000 in 2017, if the scheme remains in deficit at the time of the payment.
The group is not committed to making any further deficit reduction contributions as at the year end.
Active members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme are required to make annual contributions to the scheme.
Currently, these contributions represent an average of 7.8% of pensionable salaries 2015: 7.8%.
With effect from 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 19,000 2015: nil.
No additional lump sum contributions were paid in 2016 2015: nil, and the group has no commitment to make further contributions.
Regular contributions to the Laurence Keen Scheme stopped with effect from 1 January 2015.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time-to-time, and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the company.
The ordinary shareholders are entitled to any residual assets on the winding up of the company.
On 20 October 2016, the company issued 2,224,210 shares by way of a placing for cash consideration at 17.10 per share, which raised 36,941,000, net of 1,093,000 placing costs, offset against share premium arising on the issue.

The number of own shares held as treasury shares by the company at 31 December 2016 was 8,979 2015: 50,000.
In addition, 31,803 shares were held in the Employee Benefit Trust at 31 December 2016 2015: 61,131 and a further 296,205 2015: 273,164 shares were held by the trustees of the Share Incentive Plan but were not unconditionally gifted to employees.
30 Share-based payments Share Incentive Plan The group operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP, which is available to all employees.
Employees can contribute up to 150 per month to acquire partnership shares, which are purchased or allotted twice a year at the end of six month accumulation periods.
The group currently matches employee contributions on a one-for-one basis to acquire matching shares.
The group also provides performance-related free shares, with eligible employees receiving shares valued at the rate of 100 per 1% real increase in earnings per share up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum.
For UK employees, SIP dividends are reinvested and used to purchase dividend shares, whilst for Jersey employees dividends are paid in cash.
As at 31 December 2016, the trustees of the SIP held 1,243,979 2015: 1,260,007 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 24,668,000 2015: 27,720,000.
Of the total number of shares held by the trustees, 294,680 2015: 268,512 have been conditionally gifted to employees and 1,525 2015: 4,652 remain unallocated.
Dividends on the unallocated shares have been waived by the trustees.
Executive Incentive Plan In 2015, the group introduced a new scheme for rewarding executive management.
It replaces the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the executive bonus scheme for 2015 onwards.
Details of the general terms of this plan are set out in the remuneration committee report on pages 63 to 64.
Under the remuneration policy, 40% of the total award will be given in cash with the remaining 60% of the award granted in shares.
The group treats the cash element of the award as an employee benefit under IAS 19 and the share element of the award as an equitysettled share-based payment under IFRS 2.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 135 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 135 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Share-based payments continued Long Term Incentive Plan This year is the last year of the group's transition from the LTIP to the Executive Incentive Plan EIP above.
The LTIP scheme will be discontinued and the variable aspect of executive management remuneration will be awarded under the EIP.
The total shareholder returnbased performance criteria have been treated as market-based vesting conditions.
Historically, the group has settled substantially all of the LTIP awards in cash as an alternative to shares.
As a consequence of this, the group treats awards under the LTIP as cash-settled rather than equity-settled.
At the year end, a liability of 1,414,000 2015: 2,543,000 has been recognised for the estimated fair value of future awards.
At 31 December 2016, the trustees held 31,803 2015: 61,131 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 631,000 2015: 1,345,000.
Dividends on these shares have been waived by the trustees.
Executive bonus scheme Shares for plan awards will be provided by market purchase or treasury shares.
Savings-related share option or Save As You Earn plan Under the Save As You Earn SAYE plan, employees can contribute up to 500 per month to acquire shares at the end of a three or five year savings period.
Further information on the scheme is given in the remuneration committee report on page 74.
Options with an aggregate estimated fair value of 672,000, determined using a binomial valuation model including expected dividends, were granted on 29 April 2016 to directors and staff under the SAYE plan.

Credit risk 2015 1,641.0 2018 and 2020 128,418 137,481 The group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its 151,570 2016 1,648.0 2019 and 2021 banking, treasury, trust and financial planning activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market At 31 December 507,714 484,364 and holding interest-bearing securities.
The group also has exposure to credit risk through its client loan book and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions and the Bank of England.
Investments with financial institutions are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Limited 'Fitch' or Moodys Corporation 'Moodys'.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.

Credit risk continued The group's financial assets are categorised as follows.
Balances with central banks note 14 The group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trusts segments have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of non-settlement is borne by clients.
Loans and advances to banks note 15 and debt and other securities note 17 The group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and, in 2015, treasury bills.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients' cash, where it is held under a banking relationship, and the groups own reserves.
The groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long term rating of single A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis by the treasury department and reviewed by the banking committee on a monthly basis, or more frequently when necessary.
The banking committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers note 16 The group provides loans to clients through its investment management operations 'the investment management loan book'.
The group is also exposed to credit risk on overdrafts on clients' investment management accounts, trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and financial planning businesses 'trust and financial planning debtors' and other debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients Investment Management accounts arise from time-to-time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a client's behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment management loan book Loans are provided as a service to Investment Management clients, who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name, and some loans may be partially secured by property.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
At 31 December 2016, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was 150,000,000 2015: 150,000,000, of which 106,276,000 had been advanced 2015: 111,682,000 and a further 31,642,000 had been committed 2015: 20,417,000. c Trust and financial planning debtors Trust and financial planning debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and financial planning debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the groups trust and financial planning businesses.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers relate to management fees receivable.
138 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 138 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 Consolidated financial statements Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually at least annually, or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case-by-case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any security and or collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and financial planning debtors, are set out in note 16.

An exposure is reported as past due when the contractual due date for settlement has passed and the balance has not been repaid, except in the case of trust and financial planning debtors, where a normal settlement period of up to 30 days is expected.
b Past due but not impaired Loans and advances that are past due are assessed for impairment and provided against where objective evidence of impairment exists.
Trust and financial planning debtors may be outstanding for some time before collection, but this is not necessarily an indication that the debt will not ultimately be collected.

Market risk Interest rate risk Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is rising and shortens it when the yield curve is falling.
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interestbearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2016, the Bank had a net present value sensitivity of 3,696,000 2015: 2,365,000 for an upward 2% shift in rates.

148 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 148 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 Consolidated financial statements Foreign exchange risk The group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time-to-time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The group has no structural foreign currency exposure.
The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.

A 10% weakening of the euro against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2016, would have reduced equity and profit after tax by 30,000 2015: reduced by 25,000.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 17.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 1,864,000 2015: 1,070,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax decrease to net assets of 110,000 2015: 60,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2015: none.
The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
In the current year, there were no gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments categorised as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
In 2015, a loss of 1,030,000 was recognised in profit or loss in relation to derivative financial instruments.
The fair values of the groups other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of the following: Held to maturity investment debt securities note 17 comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons and, in 2015, treasury bills.
Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices, and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
Subordinated loan notes note 26 comprise Tier 2 loan notes issued in 2015.
Fair value of the loan notes is based on discounted future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Rathbones is classified for capital purposes as a banking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is presented to the PRA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with published rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the PRAs Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 methodology.
The group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar 1 credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both group and entity level.
At 31 December 2016 the groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2016, were 174,192,000 2015: 144,468,000.
The increase in reserves during 2016 is due to the impact of the share placing, partially offset by a decrease in the group's retained earnings due to the loss on remeasurement of the defined benefit liabilities.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecast on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
No breaches were reported to the PRA during the financial years ended 31 December 2015 and 2016.

The group charges each fund an annual management fee for these services, but does not earn any performance fees on the unit trusts.
The management charges are calculated on the bases published in the individual fund prospectuses, which also state the terms and conditions of the management contract with the group.
The following transactions and balances relate to the groups interest in the collectives: 2016 2015 Year ended 31 December 000 000 Total management fees 27,783 23,061 2016 2015 As at 31 December 000 000 Management fees owed to the group 2,557 2,181 Holdings in unit trusts note 17 1,864 1,070 4,421 3,251 Total management fees are included within 'fee and commission income' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Management fees owed to the group are included within 'accrued income' and holdings in unit trusts are classified as 'available for sale equity securities' in the consolidated balance sheet.
The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount on the balance sheet as disclosed above.
All amounts outstanding with related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash.
No guarantees have been given or received.
No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties.
35 Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 34, at 31 December 2016, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of 1,864,000 2015: 1,070,000, representing 0.05% 2015: 0.03% of the total value of the collectives managed by the group.
These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts.
The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds.
The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives.
Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10.
154 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 154 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 Consolidated financial statements 36 Consolidated statement of cash flows For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following balances with less than three months until maturity from the date of acquisition.

Cash flows arising from issuing ordinary shares comprise: 2016 2015 000 000 Share capital issued note 28 128 12 42,348 Share premium on shares issued note 28 4,656 1,631 Shares issued in relation to share-based schemes for which no cash consideration was received 2,413 Shares issued in relation to business combinations note 28 646 40,199 2,255 37 Events after the balance sheet date Member consultation on closing the pension scheme On 20 October 2016, the group commenced a consultation with members of the schemes with a view to ceasing future accrual and breaking the link to final salary in both schemes.
Following the consultation period, the group has confirmed to members its intention to close the Rathbone 1987 Scheme to future accrual and to break the link to final salary for both schemes, with effect from 1 July 2017.
The impact of these changes, if they had been confirmed on 31 December 2016, would have been to reduce the reported defined benefit obligation by an estimated 6,100,000.
Relocation of the London head office The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office concluded on 13 February 2017, which triggered recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease see note 9.
The ultimate amount of the provision is dependent on the timing of any subletting agreement and the associated terms agreed with relevant third parties.
Based on management's expectations of future costs for the premises and potential rental income, and timings thereof, a net charge to profit or loss of 10,000,000 was recognised on 13 February 2017.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 155 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2016 155 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Country-by-country reporting Introduction HM Treasury has transposed the requirements set out under Capital Requirements Directive IV CRD IV and issued the Capital Requirements Country-by-Country Reporting Regulations 2013, effective 1 January 2014.
The legislation requires Rathbone Brothers Plc together with its subsidiaries, the group to publish certain additional information, on a consolidated basis, for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Basis of preparation Country In most cases, we have determined the country by reference to the country of tax residence.
Where an entity is not subject to tax e. g. a partnership we have considered the location of management or the jurisdiction in which the revenues are generated.
In these cases it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one in which profits are reported.
Nature of activities The nature of activities within the United Kingdom are described within our services on pages 2 to 5.
Discretionary investment management is the sole activity which occurs in Jersey.
Turnover Turnover is defined as operating income.
As the consolidated results are split by country, there is an element of double counting when inter-jurisdictional transactions for example, the payment of dividends occur.
The entries to eliminate this double counting are included at the bottom of the table to enable the disclosed figures to agree to the published consolidated accounts of the group.
Profit loss before taxation These are accounting profits.
As with turnover some double counting may arise and again this has been eliminated at the bottom of the table.
The majority of the total relates to the elimination of interjurisdictional dividends which are reflected as profits in the United Kingdom.
Tax paid This column reflects corporation tax actually paid in the year.
Note that it is rare that tax paid in any given year relates directly to the profits earned in the same period.
Public subsidies received The group received no public subsidies in the year.
Number of employees The number of employees reported is the average number of full time employees who were permanently employed by the group, or one of its subsidiaries, during the year.
A list of the subsidiaries of the group, including their main activity and country of incorporation, is shown Subsidiaries within note 43.
