Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental analysis The Group has eight reportable segments which have been identified based on the operating segments of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, which has been determined to be the Executive Committee, in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Operating segments are then aggregated into reporting segments to combine those with similar economic characteristics.
The management and reporting of the previous North Asia and South Asia regions has changed to encompass the combination of these to form an Asia region, as well as moving China from the Emerging Markets region to Asia.
In addition, and reflecting the percentage of the European region as a proportion of the Group across revenue, profit and assets, UK and Europe has been formed as a new reporting region.
The new region encompasses the UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, Finland, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
The following summary describes the operations of each of the Groups reportable segments: Distribution Australasia Distribution of new vehicles and parts in Australia and New Zealand together with associated marketing and logistics operations.
UK and Europe Distribution of new vehicles and parts, together with associated marketing activities, in mature European markets.

110 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 110 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its businesses, primarily in the UK.
a. UK schemes: benefits, governance, cash flow obligations and investments The Group operates three main defined benefit final salary pension schemes in the UK which are all closed to new employees and largely closed to future benefit accrual.
The schemes are the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme comprising the Group, Motors, Normand and Cash sections, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
Cash is a defined benefit cash balance scheme, open to accrual for current and new employees, which is designed to meet regulatory requirements for auto-enrolment legislation.
Benefit structure Final salary schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on final salary at retirement or leaving date, if earlier and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet the obligations under the schemes.
In the event of poor returns, increased life expectancy or higher than expected inflation, the Group is required to address any shortfall through a combination of an increase in contributions or by making appropriate adjustments to the schemes.
Cash balance schemes like Cash allow members to accrue a percentage of their earnings each year, which then grows to provide a lump sum payment on retirement.
Members have accrued benefits under this scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.
The Group underwrites the investment risk to normal retirement age 65, but all inflation and mortality risks associated with benefits are borne solely by the members.
Governance Our UK schemes are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK Pensions Regulator.
Benefits are paid to members from separate funds administered by an independent trustee company the Trustee appointed by the Group.
The Trustee is required to act in the best interest of the members, and is responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.
The Group also has some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
Scheme specific cash obligation investment detail Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme Group, Motors and Normand Sections closed sections The latest actuarial valuations for these sections were carried out at 5 April 2016 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 18 years and that a small surplus existed.
The Group contributes 0.6m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running these sections and no further review is scheduled until April 2019.
For the Normand Section, the Group also pays deficit reduction contributions of 1.0m p. a. rising by 3.05% p. a. up until 5 April 2026 at which point the funding shortfall is expected to be eliminated.
Each sections investment strategy sees it holding a proportion of its assets in matching assets 75% for the Group section and 40% for the Motors and Normand sections with the remainder in growth assets.
The matching assets are invested in a liability driven investment solution complemented with absolute return bonds.
They are designed to hedge inflation and interest rate risk in a capitally efficient manner.
The growth assets are invested in assets that are expected to grow at rates significantly faster than each sections liabilities and include diversified growth funds and property.
Cash Section This scheme is a defined benefit scheme under which members accrue benefits with effect from 1 January 2013, or date of joining if later.
The latest actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2016 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The valuation showed the funding level to be 98%, with the Trustee expecting the small shortfall to be removed by the ongoing pension contributions and returns on the assets held.
The Group contributes 0.2m p. a. towards the administrative costs of running the scheme and the next review is in April 2019.
The investment strategy is to be 60% invested in diversified growth funds which are designed to grow at a rate significantly faster than the liabilities, whilst spreading investment risk across a broad spectrum of asset classes.
The remaining 40% is allocated to absolute return bonds.
com 111 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is subject to regulations similar to the UK.
It is therefore reported under the United Kingdom in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2015 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 12 years and that the scheme was approximately 86% funded on a prudent funding basis.
The Group contributes 0.8m p. a. towards scheme administrative costs and improving the funding ratio.
The investments are managed under a Fiduciary Management arrangement with the level of investment risk inherent in the investment arrangements reducing as and when the funding level improves.
TKM Group Pension Scheme closed scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit credit method.
The actuarial valuation determined that the duration of the liabilities was approximately 12 years and that the scheme was considered fully funded on a prudent basis.
No cash contributions were required by the Group.
In November 2015, the trustees of the TKM Group Pension Scheme completed a buy-in transaction whereby the assets of the scheme were used to acquire a bulk purchase annuity policy with Aviva under which the benefits payable to the members of the scheme are now fully insured.
The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the scheme with no additional funding required from the Group.
The insurance policy has been structured to enable the scheme, in time, to move to full buy-out, following which Aviva will become directly responsible for the pension payments under the scheme.
As at 31 December 2016, the bulk purchase annuity policy has been accounted for as an asset of the scheme and valued on the same basis as the liabilities that it matches.
Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee and assets are held in trust in separately administered funds.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
c. Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is 5.4m 2015 4.6m.
There are outstanding contributions of 0.1m at the year end 2015 0.1m.
d. Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately from the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported in the following tables.

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 23.8 years 2015 23.9 years for current pensioners and 25.6 years 2015 25.7 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.

com 115 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The following disclosures relate to the Groups defined benefit plans only.
e. Risk management Asset volatility Scheme liabilities are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If scheme assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit.
The combined schemes hold approximately 75% of assets as defensive assets liability driven investment solutions, absolute return bonds and annuity policies which mitigate significant changes in yields, and active monitoring plans are in place to identify opportunities to increase the proportion of such assets further when economically possible.
As the schemes mature, the Trustees reduce investment risk by increasing the allocation to defensive assets, which are designed to better match scheme liabilities.
However, the Trustees believe that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations.
The Groups investment strategy across the schemes is to mitigate inflation risk through holding inflation-linked assets.
Life expectancy The plans obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans benefit payments.
Future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty.
All of the schemes conduct scheme-specific mortality investigations annually, to ensure the Group has a clear understanding of any potential increase in liability due to pensioners living for longer than assumed.
The Trustees of the scheme hedge this risk by adopting a prudent approach in their assumption for future improvements.
f. Sensitivity analysis The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the assumptions used for the UK schemes.
Changes in assumptions have an immaterial effect on the overseas schemes.
Impact on the defined benefit obligation United Kingdom 2016 2015 m m Discount rate -0.25% 43.5 34.9 Discount rate 0.25% -49.7 -32.9 Inflation -0.25% -37.8 -29.2 Inflation 0.25% 33.9 30.8 Life expectancy 1 year 37.4 30.6 The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably possible fluctuations.
g. Expected future cash flows The Group has agreed to pay approximately 2.7m to its defined benefit plans in 2017 on top of the ongoing employer contributions for the open Cash section.
The Group does not expect any material changes to the annual cash contributions over the next three years given the funding position of the largest schemes, which account for 90% of the Groups total pension liabilities.
The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members over the next several decades.
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years for the UK schemes.

Not all of the exceptional items will be allowable for tax purposes.
Therefore the tax credit on exceptional items represents the total of the current and deferred tax on only those elements that are assessed as allowable.
The exceptional deferred tax charge in the prior year related to the decision not to recognise the deferred tax asset on tax losses in Russia.
Factors affecting the tax expense for the year The effective tax rate for the year after exceptional items is 28.6% 2015 30.4%.
The underlying effective tax rate before the impact of exceptional items is 25.2% 2015 24.0%.
The weighted average tax rate is 24.1% 2015 24.3%.
The weighted average tax rate comprises the average statutory rates across the Group, weighted in proportion to accounting profits and losses.

In addition, a change in profit mix between low and high taxed jurisdictions will impact the Groups future tax expense and this could happen as a result of acquisitions, for example the acquisition of certain businesses from Empresas Indumotora S. A. see note 28.
The utilisation of brought forward tax losses or the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with such losses may also give rise to tax charges or credits.
The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon an assessment of whether it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.
Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits.
More detail of the Groups tax losses and deferred tax assets can be found in note 16.
During the period, the Finance Act 2016 was passed reducing the UK Corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
This rate was enacted at the balance sheet date and hence this rate is now relevant for measuring deferred tax balances in the UK.

No borrowing costs were capitalised during the year 2015 nil.
During the year, the Group acquired a multi-country scale Distribution business in South America, focused on Subaru and Hino and operating in the growth markets of Chile, Colombia, Peru and Argentina.
The principal intangible assets acquired were agreements with manufacturers for the distribution of new vehicles and parts with an estimated value of 162.4m.
Such agreements have varying terms and periods of renewal and have historically been renewed indefinitely without substantial cost.
The Group therefore expects these agreements to be renewed indefinitely.
120 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 120 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs or group of CGUs hereafter collectively referred to as CGU groups that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination.
These CGU groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGU groups within the following reporting segments: 2016 2015 Reporting Segment CGU Group m m UK and Europe Retail UK Retail 265.6 266.1 Emerging Markets Distribution South America 51.2 UK and Europe Distribution Lithuania 19.0 UK and Europe Distribution Other 2.2 Asia Singapore 22.8 19.4 Australasia Retail Australia Retail 45.4 38.6 385.0 345.3 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGU groups during the year ended 31 December 2016.
The recoverable amounts of all CGU groups were determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on five-year financial forecasts prepared by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth, operating margins, the level of working capital required to support trading and capital expenditure, which have been based on past experience, recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.
They also reflect expectations about continuing relationships with key brand partners.
Cash flows after the five-year period are extrapolated for each market using declining growth rates of between 4.5% and 2.0% for a further five years.
A terminal value calculation is used to estimate the cash flows after year ten using a long-term growth rate of 2%.
Cash flows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rates used are calculated as the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant country.
The pre-tax discount rates used vary between 10% and 13% and reflect long-term country risk.
Impairment The Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill in Lithuania and Estonia and have concluded that although these markets continue to provide profitable growth opportunities, it is prudent to reduce operational forecasts.
Based on this, the Directors have determined that an impairment charge of 24.9m should be recognised, representing the full carrying value of goodwill in these businesses.
During the year, the Group has made configuration changes to the iPower system to better reflect the Ignite strategy.
This has resulted in a number of areas of functionality being superseded and as such, we have recorded an exceptional, non-cash impairment charge of 22.8m.
Sensitivities The Groups value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used.
A reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause a material impairment of goodwill in any of the CGU groups.

If the parties subject to the agreement do not elect to settle on a net basis, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis.
However, each party to the netting agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of a default of the other party.
c. Market risk and sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to Japanese Yen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges from movements in interest rates are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the consolidated income statement.
d. Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense, and protecting the Group from material adverse movements in interest rates.
Throughout 2016, the Group has borrowed at floating rates only after taking into account existing interest rate hedging activities.
This approach maximises the Groups exposure to the current low interest rate environment.
If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future, the Board has approved the fixing of up to 30% of gross borrowings.
Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the floating rate interest payable on the Groups Private Placement loan notes, bank borrowings, supplier related finance and the returns available on surplus cash.
In December 2016, the Group entered into agreements to issue 210m in new private placement loan notes see note 22 primarily to refinance the existing loan notes due to mature in 2017 and 2019.
The new loan rates will be issued at a fixed interest rate.
Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on bank borrowings, supplier related finance and cash balances as at 31 December 2016 with all other variables held constant.

com 133 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued e. Foreign currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net assets, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group has transactional currency exposures, where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than that units functional currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group, these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.
The principal exception is for our business in Australasia, which purchases vehicles and parts in Japanese Yen.
In this instance, the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to the extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Under IAS 39, hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt The Group uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with the US$436m Private Placement.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currency risk table The following table shows the Group sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates on its Japanese Yen financial instruments.
In this table, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates when they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Increase decrease in Effect on exchange equity rate m 2016 Yen 10% 0.1 Yen -10% 0.1 2015 Yen 10% 0.1 Yen -10% 0.1 f. Credit risk The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of financial instruments creates credit risk.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use financial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better, where available.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Credit limits are reviewed regularly.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Total cash at bank of 473.7m 2015 335.3m includes cash in the Groups regional pooling arrangements which are offset against borrowings for interest purposes.
Netting of cash and overdraft balances in the consolidated statement of financial position only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.
As such, overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Trade receivables include amounts due from a number of finance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on finance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each finance house.
Limits for the maximum outstanding with each finance house are set accordingly.
g. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.

com 135 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued h. Fair value measurement In accordance with IFRS 13, disclosure is required for financial instruments that are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level for the following fair value measurement hierarchy: quoted prices in active markets level 1 : inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : or inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: 2016 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Derivatives used for hedging 160.1 160.1 134.5 134.5 Available for sale financial assets 1.6 2.2 3.8 1.4 1.4 1.6 160.1 2.2 163.9 1.4 134.5 135.9 Liabilities Derivatives used for hedging 53.6 53.6 3.6 3.6 Level 1 represents the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets and is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market level 2 is determined by using valuation techniques which include the present value of estimated future cash flows.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange and prevailing forward interest rates at 31 December 2016.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swaps 155.0 107.4 Forward foreign exchange contracts 5.1 27.1 53.6 3.6 160.1 134.5 53.6 3.6 The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounted to a gain of 1.0m 2015 gain of 0.9m.
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash flow hedges amounted to a gain of nil 2015 nil.
136 Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 136 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2015 12 months.
The nominal principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2016 was 1,078.7m 2015 535.3m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity see note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2016 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within 12 months of the end of the reporting period 2015 12 months.
Fair value hedge At 31 December 2016, the Group had in place five cross currency interest rate swaps.
Four of these total US$475m, which hedge changes in the fair value of the Groups 10 and 12 year Private Placement loan notes.
Under these swaps, the Group receives fixed rate US Dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04% on US$200m and pays GBP LIBOR 85bps and GBP LIBOR 90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.
An additional US$39.2m cross currency interest rate swap was put in place after the debt reduction in 2009 to offset the nonrequired portion of the original US$475m swaps.
Under this swap, the Group pays US Dollar interest of 6.04% on US$39.2m and receives GBP LIBOR 214bps for the 12 year notes only.
The loan notes and cross currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Capital management The Groups capital structure consists of equity and debt.
Equity represents funds raised from shareholders and debt represents funds raised from banks and other financial institutions.
The primary objective of the Groups management of debt and equity is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to finance the Groups activities, both now and in the future, and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year prior to the announcement of results, taking into account the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the requirements of its business plan.
The Group uses Return on Capital Employed ROCE as a measure of its ability to drive better returns on the capital invested in the Groups operations.
2016 2015 Return on Capital Employed 29.8% 29.8% The committed bank facilities and Private Placement borrowings are subject to the same interest cover covenant based on an adjusted EBITA measure to interest on consolidated borrowings.
The Group is required to maintain a ratio of not less than three to one and was compliant with this covenant throughout the year.
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests: Adjusted EBITA interest cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio of net debt to market capitalisation.
2016 2015 Adjusted EBITA interest cover times 300.9 111.8 Net debt to EBITDA times n a n a Net debt market capitalisation percentage n a n a Calculated as Adjusted EBITA interest on consolidated borrowings.
Calculated as net debt earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

Acquisitions On 22 December 2016, the Group acquired a multi-country scale Distribution business in South America, focused on Subaru and Hino and operating in the growth markets of Chile, Colombia, Peru and Argentina.
The business was acquired from Empresas Indumotora S. A.
Details of the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition are set out below: 2016 m 1 Assets and liabilities acquired, at provisional values Intangible assets 3.6 Property, plant and equipment 29.6 Tax assets 9.7 Inventory 73.0 Trade and other receivables 67.4 Other assets 2.2 Cash and cash equivalents 29.9 Trade and other payables 91.5 Provisions 4.4 Borrowings 48.7 Tax liabilities 7.2 Other liabilities 0.3 Net assets acquired 63.3 Distribution agreements recognised on acquisition net of deferred tax see notes 11 and 16 112.2 Goodwill 51.2 Purchase consideration 226.7 1 Given the proximity of the acquisition prior to the year end, work is underway to identify the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
The value at which assets and liabiltiies are stated above are therefore provisional values largely based on book values at the acquisition date.
Net cash in business acquired 29.9 Borrowings in business acquired 48.7 18.8 The goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future cash flows of the acquired business and synergies expected to arise following integration with the Groups existing business in South America.
Specifically, the goodwill represents the premium paid to expand the Groups presence in this important market and to create a scale Distribution platform across South America with attractive growth prospects.
This provides a platform to deliver growth and improved returns far quicker than would have been achievable through organic expansion.
During the year, the Group also acquired a number of sites in the UK in relation to the optimisation of our Jaguar Land Rover footprint ahead of the new combined site format being launched in the UK, and a site in Australia.
Consideration for the acquisitions was 4.3m with goodwill arising on the transaction of 0.2m.
b. Proforma full year information If the acquisition of the South American Distribution business had occurred on 1 January 2016, the approximate revenue and operating profit before exceptional items for the period ended 31 December 2016 of the Group would have been 8,203.1m and 384.3m respectively.
This information has been estimated based on the management information of the acquired business prior to acquisition.
c. Disposals During the year, the Group disposed of certain Jaguar Land Rover sites in the UK as part of the footprint optimisation referred to above, a site in Australia and finalised the liquidation of a joint venture in Greece.
In 2015, the Group disposed of a small number of dealerships in Australia and its interest in Excelease SA, a financial services business in Belgium, generating disposal proceeds of 5.4m and a profit on disposal of 0.6m.

Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order Inchcape is a participant in an action in the United Kingdom against HM Revenue and Customs HMRC in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order FII GLO.
There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO.
The action concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.
The resolution of test cases is incomplete.
The current status of the test case is that a judgment on a range of issues of quantification was handed down by the Court of Appeal on 24 November 2016.
HMRC have applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal the Court of Appeals judgment of November 2016 on all issues on which they were unsuccessful.
The outcome of this application is not yet known.
Inchcape is not a test case and its specific claim under the FII GLO has not been considered by the Courts.
In September 2015 Inchcape filed an application at the High Court for summary judgment in respect of the Foreign Income Dividend FID component of the FII GLO.
This is a claim for restitution of Advance Corporation Tax ACT paid under the FID regime and is a subsidiary component of the FII GLO.
In January 2016, Henderson J handed down judgment in favour of a number of claimants in the GLO who had brought similar applications.
HMRC agreed that that judgment should also apply to resolve Inchcapes application in its favour.
Subsequently, the Group received a payment from HMRC.
The award under the summary judgment was 6.5m and this has been reported within other operating income.
The net payment received was 3.5m after tax at 45%.
This net payment is subject to refund if HMRC are granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on the issue concerning FID claims and that appeal is then successful.
No potential receipts have been recognised in the period to 31 December 2016 in the results of the Group in relation to the balance of the claim in the FII GLO due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome given the test case has not yet completed nor has Inchcapes specific claim been heard by the Courts.
