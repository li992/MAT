3i Group Annual report and accounts 2016 146 Portfolio and other information 25 Large investments The 25 investments listed below account for 79% of the portfolio at 31 March 2016 2015: 81%.
This table does not include two investments that have been excluded for commercial reasons.
For each of our investments we have assessed whether they classify as accounting subsidiaries under IFRS and or subsidiaries under the UK Companies Act.
This assessment forms the basis of our disclosure of accounting subsidiaries in the financial statements.
The UK Companies Act defines a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an entity being classied as a subsidiary.
IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed an accounting subsidiary.
Accounting subsidiaries under IFRS 10 within the 25 large investments below are noted.
None of these investments are UK Companies Act subsidiaries.
In accordance with Section 29 of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive AIFMD, 3i Investments plc, as AIFM, encourages all controlled portfolio companies to make available to employees and investors an Annual report which meets the disclosure requirements of the Directive.
These are available either on the portfolio companys website or through ling with the relevant local authorities.
