Notes to the consolidated financial statements 107 25.
Financial instruments and risk management Risk management is performed by BT Group plc, the ultimate parent company.
The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as the groups exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the BT Group plc Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director BT Group plc.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk profile between 31 March 2016 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy Interest rate risk arises primarily from the groups long-term borrowings.
Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rate, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.
The groups policy, as set by the BT Group plc Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at fixed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director of Treasury and Risk Management or the BT Group Treasurer who each have been delegated such authority from the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate profile, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to fixed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inflows and net outflows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The BT Group plc Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director of Treasury and Risk Management or the BTGroup Treasurer who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency, capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The table below reflects the currency and interest rate profile of our loans and borrowings after the impact of hedging.
2016 2015 Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate interest interest Total interest interest Total At 31 March m m m m m m Sterling 11,417 2,253 13,670 7,601 1,995 9,596 Euro 594 594 482 482 Total 11,417 2,847 14,264 7,601 2,477 10,078 Ratio of fixed to floating 80% 20% 100% 75% 25% 100% Weighted average effective fixed interest rate Sterling 6.0% 6.3% The floating rate loans and borrowings bear interest rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one day to one year, primarily by reference to LIBOR and EURIBOR quoted rates.
Sensitivity analysis The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: for interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies: and for foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies.
The impact on the groups annual net finance expense of a 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease of 123m 2014 15: 200m.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates is as detailed below: 2016 2015 m m Increase Increase At 31 March Reduce Reduce Sterling interest rates 626 428 US Dollar interest rates 374 400 Euro interest rates 263 34 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
The groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, and within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures was insignificant in both 2015 16 and 2014 15. Credit ratings The groups December 2030 bond contains covenants which have required the group to pay higher rates of interest once the group ceased to be rated at least A3 in the case of Moodys or at least A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 1.9bn at 31 March 2016, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 9m a year if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups credit ratings were as detailed below: 2016 2015 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Standard & Poors BBB Positive BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 Positive Baa2 Positive Notes to the consolidated financial statements 109 25.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short-, mediumand long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Refinancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise.
The maturity profile of the groups loans and borrowings at 31 March 2016 is disclosed in note 23.
The group has term debt maturities of 1.9bn in 2016 17.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
The group holds cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2016 the group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2014 15: 1.5bn maturing in September 2020 with the option to renew to September 2021.
Maturity analysis The following table provides an analysis of the remaining contractually-agreed cash flows including interest payable for the groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differs from both the carrying value and fair value.

b Foreign currency-related cash flows were translated at closing rates as at the relevant reporting date.
Future variable interest rate cash flows were calculated using the most recent rate applied at the relevant balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables are held at amortised cost.
The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts payable.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The following table provides an analysis of the contractually agreed cash flows in respect of the groups derivative financial instruments.
Cash flows are presented on a net or gross basis in accordance with the settlement arrangements of the instruments.

Credit risk management Management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the BT Group plc Boards defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moodys and S&P and by defining the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for shortterm investments.
Action is taken, where appropriate and cost effective if counterparties, in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Operational management policy The groups credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, the group may endeavour to minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2016 2015 At 31 March Notes m m Derivative financial assets 1,639 1,329 Investments 21 15,236 23,185 a Trade and other receivables 16 2,956 2,264 Cash and cash equivalents 22 490 429 20,321 27,207 a The carrying amount excludes 233m 2014 15: 184m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 1,116m 2014 15: 876m of prepayments and other receivables.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 111 25.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.
2016 2015 Moodys S&P credit rating of counterparty m m Aa2 AA and above 2,878 3,133 Aa3 AA 120 206 A1 A 64 248 a A2 A 939 793 A3 A 160 121 Baa1 BBB 492 439 Baa2 BBB and below 11 4,653 4,951 a The group holds cash collateral of 553m 2014 15: 437m in respect of derivative financial assets with certain counterparties.
The concentration of credit risk for trading balances of the group is provided in note 17, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, the group has entered into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
The group has also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional 1,882m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash inflow during the year was 79m 2014 15: cash inflow of 297m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within current asset investments and loans and other borrowings, respectively.

On initial recognition of this derivative energy contract a gain was deferred.
At 31March 2016 the amount deferred and not yet recognised in the income statement was nil 2014 15: 14m.
The fair value of the energy derivative at 31 March 2016 was nil.
It has been valued using assumptions on volumes, inflation and energy prices.
Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euroand US Dollardenominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to the groups 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect the groups income statement as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings see note 23.
Forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies are hedged 12 months forward, with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows are recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were effective in the period.
See note 26 for details of the movements in the cash flow hedge reserve.
Fair value hedges In 2014 15 fair value hedges consisted of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the 2028 Sterling bond due to movements in market interest rates.
These were fide-designated on 1 April 2015.
Gains and losses arising on fair value hedges are disclosed in note 24.
Other derivatives The groups policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
