1 Strategic Reportcontinued 1.13 Summary of financial performance 1.13.1 Group overview Our selected financial information reflects the operations of the BHP Billiton Group and should be read in conjunction with the FY2016 Financial Statements, together with the accompanying notes.
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as outlined in the Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
We publish our Consolidated Financial Statements in US dollars.
Comparative financial information for FY2014, FY2013 and FY2012 has been restated for the effects of the application of IFRS 5 AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations following the demerger of South32 in FY2015, unless otherwise noted.
Consolidated Balance Sheet information for these periods is not required to be, and has not been, restated.
All Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement information below has been derived from audited Financial Statements, except the previously published FY2012 restated data which was not required to be, and was not, subject to audit.
For more information, refer to section 5.
Information in this section has been presented on a Continuing operations basis to exclude the contribution from assets that were demerged with South32, unless otherwise noted.

IFRS 5 AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations does not require the Consolidated Balance Sheet to be restated for comparative periods.
4 Underlying attributable profit, Underlying EBITDA, Underlying EBIT and Underlying basic earnings per share are non-IFRS financial measures that we use to reflect the underlying performance of BHP Billiton.
Underlying attributable profit is attributable loss profit excluding Discontinued operations and any exceptional items and Underlying basic earnings per share is Underlying attributable profit per basic share.
Underlying EBITDA is earnings before net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation and impairments, taxation expense, Discontinued operations and any exceptional items.
Underlying EBIT is Underlying EBITDA, including depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
We believe that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or as an alternative to attributable loss profit as an indicator of actual operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBIT are included in the FY2016 Consolidated Financial Statements as required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
For a reconciliation of Underlying attributable profit to attributable loss profit and of Underlying EBITDA to Loss profit after taxation from Continuing operations for FY2016, FY2015 and FY2014, refer to section 1.13.2.
5 Cash basis capital and exploration expenditure represents purchases of property, plant and equipment plus exploration expenditure from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
BHP Billiton share capital and exploration expenditure represents Cash basis, plus BHP Billitons share of equity accounted investments capital and exploration expenditure, less capitalised deferred stripping and non-controlling interests.
FY2012 capital and exploration expenditure Cash basis and BHP Billiton share includes capital and exploration expenditure from Discontinued operations.
6 Net operating cash flows are after dividends received, net interest and taxation and include Net operating cash flows from Discontinued operations.

Management believes this measure of, or as an alternative to, comparable IFRS measures.
provides useful information regarding the tax impacts from Other financial measures underlying operations.
We use a number of other financial measures each of which Underlying EBITDA is earnings before net finance costs, is calculated by reference to IFRS measures to assess our depreciation, amortisation and impairments, taxation expense, performance.
Such other financial measures include: Discontinued operations and any exceptional items.
Underlying Free cash flow comprises Net operating cash flows less Net EBITDA includes BHP Billitons share of loss profit from investing cash flows and excludes Discontinued operations.
investments accounted for using the equity method, including Gearing ratio represents the ratio of net debt to net debt net finance costs, depreciation, amortisation and impairments plus Net assets.
Management believes focusing on Net debt comprises Interest bearing liabilities less Cash and Underlying EBITDA more closely reflects the operating cash cash equivalents for the total operations within the Group at the generative capacity and hence the underlying performance reporting date.
In past periods, we have reported Underlying EBIT as a key non-IFRS measure of operating results.
For our Financial Statements, refer to section 5.
Controllable cash costs comprises operating cash costs and exploration and business development costs and excludes Discontinued operations.
Management believes this measure provides useful information regarding the Companys financial performance because it considers these expenses to be the principal operating and overhead expenses that are most directly under the Companys control.

2 Group and unallocated items includes functions, other unallocated operations, including Potash previously disclosed in the former Petroleum and Potash reportable segment, Nickel West and consolidated adjustments.
Revenue not attributable to reportable segments comprises the sale of freight and fuel to third parties, as well as revenues from unallocated operations.
Revenue of US$30.9 billion reduced by US$13.7 billion, or 31 per cent, from US$44.6 billion in FY2015.
This decrease was primarily attributable to weaker average realised prices across all major commodities.
For a discussion of the average realised prices of our commodities, refer to section 1.8.
Lower volumes during the year, particularly for copper at Escondida due to anticipated grade decline and Onshore US deferral of development activity for value, also contributed to the decline in revenue.
For production results from our operations during the periods, refer to section 6.2.
Total expenses of US$35.5 billion reduced by US$1.5 billion, or four per cent, from US$37.0 billion in FY2015.
This was due to a US$1.3 billion reduction in Employee benefits expense related to lower headcount, a US$1.3 billion reduction in External services related to lower contractor expenditure and a US$604 million reduction in Raw materials and consumables used due to lower fuel and energy costs.
Depreciation and amortisation expense declined by US$497 million due to a reduction in the depreciable asset base at Onshore US due to impairments previously recorded.
Impairment of assets of US$7.4 billion in FY2016 primarily relates to Onshore US assets.
Loss profit from operations of US$ 6.2 billion reduced by US$14.9 billion from FY2015 primarily as a result of a significant decline in commodity prices, the impairment of the Onshore US assets and the financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure refer to section 1.13.2, partially offset by the cost reductions described above.
Net finance costs of US$1.0 billion increased by US$410 million, or 67 per cent, from US$614 million in FY2015 due to the issue of multi-currency hybrid notes during FY2016 refer to section 1.13.3 and note 19 Net debt to the Financial Statements, higher benchmark interest rates and a gain on the early redemption of the Petrohawk Energy Corporation Senior Notes in FY2015.
The Groups statutory effective tax rate for FY2016 presents as nil FY2015: 45.5 per cent because we recognised a total taxation benefit of US$1.1 billion including government imposed royalty-related taxation calculated by reference to profits, and a loss before taxation for the period of US$7.3 billion.
The Groups adjusted effective tax rate was 35.8 per cent FY2015: 31.8 per cent.
The increase in the Groups adjusted effective tax rate in FY2016 reflects the relative higher proportion of profit from Australian petroleum assets which are subject to a higher rate of tax due to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax in the Groups overall profit compared to FY2015.
68 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 1 Strategic Report 2 Governance at BHP Billiton 3 Remuneration Report 4 Directors Report 1.13.1 Group overview continued The adjusted effective tax rate is reconciled to the statutory effective tax rate in the table below: 2016 2015 Income tax Income tax Loss profit benefit Loss profit benefit before taxation expense before taxation expense Year ended 30 June US$M US$M % US$M US$M % Statutory effective tax rate 7,259 1,052 8,056 3,666 45.5% Adjusted for: Exchange rate movements 125 339 Exceptional items 9,704 2,053 3,196 250 Adjusted effective tax rate 2,445 876 35.8% 11,252 3,577 31.8% Government royalties paid and payable which are not profit based are recognised as operating costs within Loss profit before taxation.

The major contributor was a US$8.9 billion decrease in cash generated from operations after changes in working capital balances, which was partially offset by a decrease of US$2.4 billion in net taxes paid.
Despite the significant decline in commodity prices, we generated US$3.4 billion of free cash flow net operating cash flows less net investing cash flows during FY2016 due to a reduction in operating costs and a targeted reduction of working capital.
Net investing cash flows of US$7.2 billion reduced by US$5.9 billion from FY2015 due to a US$5.1 billion reduction in capital and exploration expenditure.
Exploration expenditure was US$765 million, including US$430 million classified within Net operating cash flows.
Net financing cash inflows of US$284 million increased by US$8.6 billion from outflows of US$8.3 billion in FY2015, due to the issue of multi-currency hybrid notes during FY2016 refer to section 1.13.3 and note 19 Net debt to the Financial Statements and lower dividends paid in line with the new dividend policy.

BHP Billitons share of capital and exploration expenditure declined by 42 per cent during FY2016 to US$6.4 billion.
On a cash basis, capital and exploration expenditure was US$7.7 billion, a decrease of 40 per cent from FY2015.
Our rate of investment is expected to decline to US$5.4 billion on a cash basis and to US$5.0 billion BHP Billitons share in FY2017.
1.13.2 Underlying financial measures We use several financial measures to monitor the financial performance of our overall strategy.
The two key non-IFRS measures are Underlying attributable profit and Underlying EBITDA.
Underlying attributable profit is the key performance indicator against which short-term incentive outcomes for our senior executives are measured.
Underlying EBITDA is the key non-IFRS measure that management uses internally to assess the performance of our segments and make decisions on the allocation of resources and, in our view is more relevant to capital intensive industries with long-life assets.
Underlying attributable profit Underlying attributable profit of US$1.2 billion decreased by US$5.2 billion from FY2015 due to a significant decline in commodity prices.
The following table reconciles Underlying attributable profit to Attributable loss profit: 2016 2015 2014 Year ended 30 June US$M US$M US$M Underlying attributable profit 1,215 6,417 13,263 Attributable loss Discontinued operations 1,573 184 Exceptional items after taxation 7,651 2,946 385 1 Non-controlling interest in exceptional items 51 12 Attributable loss profit 6,385 1,910 13,832 1 Relates to non-controlling interest included in the impairment of Onshore US assets in FY2016.

The following table provides a summary of exceptional items for FY2016, which are discussed further below: Gross Tax Net Year ended 30 June 2016 US$M US$M US$M Exceptional items by category Samarco dam failure 2,450 253 2,197 1 Impairment of Onshore US assets 7,184 2,300 4,884 Global taxation matters 70 500 570 Total 9,704 2,053 7,651 1 Includes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests of US$ 51 million after tax benefit.
Samarco Minerao S. A. Samarco dam failure The exceptional loss of US$2,450 million before tax related to the Samarco dam failure in November 2015 comprises the following: Year ended 30 June 2016 US$M Share of loss relating to the Samarco dam failure 655 Impairment of the carrying value of the investment in Samarco 525 Samarco dam failure provision 1,200 Costs incurred directly by BHP Billiton in relation to the Samarco dam failure 70 1 Loss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses 2,450 1 BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda has adjusted its investment in Samarco to US$ nil resulting from US$ 655 million share of loss from Samarco and US$ 525 million impairment, recognised a provision of US$ 1,200 million for potential obligations under the Framework Agreement and together with other BHP Billiton entities incurred US$ 70 million of direct costs in relation to the Samarco dam failure.
US$ 572 million of the US$ 1,200 million provision represents an additional share of loss from Samarco with the remaining US$ 628 million recognised as provision expense.
Refer to note 3 Significant events Samarco dam failure to the Financial Statements.
Impairment of Onshore US assets The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$4.9 billion after tax benefit against the carrying value of its Onshore US assets in FY2016.
The impairment reflects changes to price assumptions, discount rates and development plans.
This follows significant volatility and much weaker prices experienced in the oil and gas industry, which have more than offset our substantial productivity improvements.
Global taxation matters Global taxation matters include amounts provided for unresolved tax matters and other claims for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain refer to note 5 Income tax expense to the Financial Statements.
The following table provides a summary of exceptional items for FY2015, which are discussed further below: Gross Tax Net Year ended 30 June 2015 US$M US$M US$M Exceptional items by category Impairment of Onshore US assets 2,787 829 1,958 Impairment of Nickel West assets 409 119 290 1 Repeal of Minerals Resource Rent Tax legislation 698 698 Total 3,196 250 2,946 1 Includes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests of US$ 12 million.
In FY2015, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$2.0 billion after tax benefit in relation to its Onshore US assets.
The gas-focused Hawkville field accounts for the substantial majority of this charge reflecting its geological complexity, product mix, acreage relinquishments and amended development plans.
The remainder relates to the impairment of goodwill associated with the Petrohawk acquisition.
The Group announced on 12 November 2014 that the review of its Nickel West business was complete and the preferred option, the sale of the business, was not achievable on an acceptable basis.
As a result of operational decisions made subsequent to the conclusion of this process, an impairment charge of US$290 million after tax benefit was recognised in FY2015.
The legislation to repeal the Minerals Resource Rent Tax MRRT in Australia took effect on 30 September 2014.
As a result, the Group derecognised a MRRT deferred tax asset of US$809 million and corresponding taxation charges of US$698 million related to Continuing operations and US$111 million related to Discontinued operations were recognised in FY2015.
The following table provides a summary of exceptional items for FY2014, which are discussed further below: Gross Tax Net Year ended 30 June 2014 US$M US$M US$M Exceptional items by category Sale of Pinto Valley 551 166 385 Total 551 166 385 In FY2014, the Group announced on 11 October 2013 that it had completed the sale of its Pinto Valley mining operation for cash consideration of US$653 million, after working capital adjustments.
A gain on sale of US$385 million after tax expense was recognised in FY2014.

2 Collectively we refer to the change in operating cash costs and change in exploration and business development as change in controllable cash costs.
Operating cash costs by definition do not include non-cash costs.
The change in operating cash costs also excludes the impact of exchange rates and inflation, changes in fuel and energy costs, changes in exploration and business development costs and one-off items.
These items are excluded so as to provide a consistent measurement of changes in costs across all segments, based on the factors that are within the control and responsibility of the segment.
Change in controllable cash costs and change in operating cash costs are not measures that are recognised by IFRS.
They may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 73 1 Strategic Reportcontinued 1.13.2 Underlying financial measures continued Principal factors affecting Underlying EBITDA Lower average realised prices across our major commodities reduced Underlying EBITDA by US$11.3 billion in FY2016, partially offset by a reduction in price-linked costs by US$592 million reflecting lower royalty charges at Western Australia Iron Ore as a result of lower average realised prices.
Anticipated grade decline of 28 per cent at Escondida was the major contributor to lower productivity-led volumes of US$782 million in Underlying EBITDA.
Deferral of development activity for value at Onshore US reduced gas volumes supporting a further volume-related decrease in Underlying EBITDA of US$383 million.
Our focus on best-in-class performance underpinned a US$1.0 billion reduction in operating cash costs during FY2016.
Lower operating cash costs across the Group more than offset the impact of the drawdown of lower-grade inventory and grade decline at Escondida.
A stronger US dollar against the Australian dollar and Chilean peso increased Underlying EBITDA by US$1.1 billion during the period.
The total increase in Underlying EBITDA relating to productivity initiatives in FY2016 was US$437 million.
The following table reconciles relevant factors with changes in the Groups productivity: 2016 2015 Year ended 30 June US$M US$M Change in operating cash costs 1,040 2,678 Change in exploration and business development 368 29 Change in controllable cash costs 1,408 2,707 Change in volumes attributed to productivity 782 1,497 Change in productivity in Underlying EBITDA 626 4,204 Change in capitalised exploration 189 142 Change attributable to productivity initiatives 437 4,346 1 Escondida grade impact 1,609 n a Change attributable to productivity initiatives excluding Escondida grade impact 2,046 n a 1 Adjusted to present on a grade equivalent basis relative to FY2015.
The method of calculation of the factors that affected Underlying EBITDA are as follows: Factor affecting Underlying EBITDA Method of calculation Change in sales prices Change in average realised price for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by current period volumes.
Price-linked costs Change in price-linked costs for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by current period volumes.
Productivity volumes Change in volumes for each operation not included in the Growth category from the corresponding period to the current period, multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBITDA margin.
Growth volumes Volume Growth comprises Underlying EBITDA for operations that are new or acquired in the current period minus Underlying EBITDA for operations that are new or acquired in the corresponding period, change in volumes for operations identified as a Growth project from the corresponding period to the current period multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBITDA margin, and change in volume for our petroleum assets from the corresponding period to the current period multiplied by the prior year Underlying EBITDA margin.
Operating cash costs Change in total costs, other than price-linked costs, exchange rates, inflation on costs, fuel and energy costs, non-cash costs and one-off items as defined below for each operation from the corresponding period to the current period.
Exploration and Exploration and business development expense in the current period minus exploration and business business development development expense in the corresponding period.
Exchange rates Change in exchange rate multiplied by current period local currency revenue and expenses.
The majority of the Companys selling prices are denominated in US dollars and so there is little impact of exchange rate changes on Revenue.
Inflation on costs Change in inflation rate applied to expenses, other than depreciation and amortisation, price-linked costs, exploration and business development expenses, expenses in ceased and sold operations and expenses in new and acquired operations.
Fuel and energy Fuel and energy expense in the current period minus fuel and energy expense in the corresponding period.
Non-cash Includes non-cash items mainly depletion of stripping capitalised.
One-off items Change in costs exceeding a pre-determined threshold associated with an unexpected event that had not occurred in the last two years and is not reasonably likely to occur within the next two years.
Asset sales Profit loss on the sale of assets or operations in the current period minus profit loss on sale in the corresponding period.
Ceased and sold operations Underlying EBITDA for operations that ceased or were sold in the current period minus Underlying EBITDA for operations that ceased or were sold in the corresponding period.
Share of operating profit from Share of operating profit from equity accounted investments for the period minus share of operating equity accounted investments profit from equity accounted investments in the corresponding period.

2 Underlying EBITDA third party products divided by Revenue third party products.
We engage in third party trading for the following reasons: Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our assets means that we sometimes source third party materials to ensure a steady supply of product to our customers.
To optimise our supply chain outcomes, we may buy physical product from third parties.
To support the development of liquid markets, we will sometimes source third party physical product and manage risk through both the physical and financial markets.
