Petroleum exploration expenditure for FY2016 was US$590 million, of which US$273 million was expensed.
Activity for the year was largely focused on our core areas in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and the Northern Beagle sub-basin off the coast of Western Australia, where we acquired additional acreage, seismic data and increased drilling activity.
Our exploration activity has increased in the Gulf of Mexico following the positive exploration well results at Shenzi North.
The Group is also encouraged by the early indications from the deepwater Le Clerc well in Trinidad and Tobago which encountered gas in multiple zones.
While the focus is on a commercial oil discovery, these results support the further appraisal of the basin.
