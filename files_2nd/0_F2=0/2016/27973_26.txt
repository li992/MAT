Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the pro t attributable to equity shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusting the pro t attributable, if applicable, to account for any tax consequences that might arise from conversion of those shares.
In 2016, the Group has outstanding share options which are anti-dilutive but which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.

Financial instruments that are measured subsequently to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into levels 1 to 3, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable, as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The Groups derivative assets valued at 171m 2015: 110m and derivative liabilities valued at 264m 2015: 165m are classi ed as level 2.
The Groups marketable securities assets valued at 10m 2015: 28m are classi ed as level 2.
The Groups investments in unlisted securities are valued at 65m 2015: 143m and are classi ed as level 3.

Retirement bene t and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan in the UK, which is sectionalised to provide both fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution pension bene ts.
The fide ned bene t section was closed to new members from 1 November 2006.
The fide ned contribution section, opened in 2003, is open to new and existing employees.
Finally, there is a separate section within the UK Group plan set up for auto-enrolment.
The fide ned bene t section of the UK Group plan is a final salary pension plan which provides bene ts to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of bene ts depends on the length of service and final pensionable pay.
The UK Group plan is funded with bene t payments from trustee-administered funds.
The UK Group plan is administered in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules in the interests of its bene ciaries by Pearson Group Pension Trustee Limited.
At 31 December 2016, the UK Group plan had approximately 25,000 members, analysed in the following table: All gures in % Active Deferred Pensioners Total fide ned bene t 127 3462 fide ned contribution 929 38 Total 10 56 34 100 The other major fide ned bene t plans are based in the US.
These are also final salary pension plans which provide bene ts to members in the form of a guaranteed pension payable for life, with the level of bene ts dependent on length of service and final pensionable pay.
The majority of the US plans are funded.
The Group also has several post-retirement medical bene t plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to fide ned bene t pension plans.
The fide ned bene t schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as life expectancy, in ation risks, and investment risk including asset volatility and changes in bond yields.
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-speci c or plan-speci c risks.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.

The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The in ation rate for the UK Group plan of 3.3% re ects the RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation in 2010, certain bene ts have been calculated with reference to CPI as the in ationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.3% has been used.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 3.8% for 2016 with a short-term assumption of 2.0% for three years.
For the UK plan, the mortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to re ect the observed experience of the plan, with CMI model improvement factors.
A 1.5% long-term rate improvement on the CMI model is applied for both males and females.
For the US plans, the mortality table RP 2014 and 2014 improvement scale MP 2014 with no adjustments have been adopted, re ecting the mortality assumption most prevalent in the US.

The weighted average share price during the year was 8.23 2015: 11.86.
Early exercises arising from redundancy, retirement or death are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the Group therefore recognises in the income statement the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the original vesting period.

The number of shares expected to vest is adjusted, based on historical experience, to account for potential forfeitures.
Participants under the plan are entitled to dividends during the vesting period and therefore the share price is not discounted.
Restricted shares with a market performance condition were valued by an independent actuary using a Monte Carlo model.
Restricted shares with a non-market performance condition were fair valued based on the share price at the date of grant.
Non-market performance conditions are taken into consideration by adjusting the number of shares expected to vest based on the most likely outcome of the relevant performance criteria.
