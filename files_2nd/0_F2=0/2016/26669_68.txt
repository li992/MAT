Other contractual property costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate.
Payments are expected to continue on these properties for periods of 1 to 76 years 2015: 1 to 77 years.
The 4.4 million increase 2015: 4.9 million in the provision as a result of updating the discount and inflation rate assumptions used in the calculation has been classified as a non-underlying item note 4.
25 Retirement benefits During the period the Group contributed to a funded defined benefit pension plan and a number of defined contribution pension plans.
Defined contribution plans Pension costs for defined contribution plans are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Defined contribution plans 6.8 6.3 Defined benefit plan The Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme is a final salary pension plan which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The plan closed to future accrual on 30 September 2014 and the link to future salary increases was also removed.
The plan operates under the UK regulatory framework and is governed by a board of Trustees composed of plan participants and representatives of the Group.
The Trustees make investment decisions and set the required contribution rates based on independent actuarial advice.
The key risks to which the plan exposes the Group are as follows: Volatility of plan assets Changes in bond yields Inflation risk Changes in life expectancy The movements in the fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation during the period were: Present value Fair value of defined Net deficit of plan assets benefit obligation surplus 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m m m At beginning of the period 482.7 453.6 467.7 445.8 15.0 7.8 Interest income expense 17.5 18.0 16.8 17.4 0.7 0.6 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets excluding interest income 59.3 19.6 59.3 19.6 Effect of changes in demographic assumptions 5.5 5.5 Effect of changes in financial assumptions 115.7 20.4 115.7 20.4 Effect of experience adjustments 11.4 11.4 Cash flows: Employer contributions 7.6 14.0 7.6 14.0 Administrative expenses paid from plan assets 0.9 0.7 0.9 0.7 Benefits paid 22.8 21.8 22.8 21.8 At end of the period 543.4 482.7 577.4 467.7 34.0 15.0 99 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes continued For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2016 25 Retirement benefits continued Pension costs recognised in the income statement A charge of 0.2 million 2015: 0.1 million comprising the net interest on the net defined benefit asset liability and the administrative expenses paid from plan assets is included within net finance costs note 6.
An updated actuarial valuation of the plan was performed by Mercer as at 1 October 2016 for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Theprincipal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2016 2015 Discount rate 2.3% 3.7% Rate of increase in pensions 5% LPI 2.9% 2.9% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% LPI 2.1% 2.1% Inflation assumption RPI 2.9% 3.0% Inflation assumption CPI 1.9% 2.0% Employed deferred revaluation 1.9% 2.0% Life expectancy for deferred members from age 65 years Male 23.4 23.3 Female 25.9 25.8 Life expectancy for current pensioners from age 65 years Male 21.7 21.6 Female 24.0 23.9 Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for plan experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the principal actuarial assumptions is: Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 0.25% Decrease by 4.3% Increase by 4.6% Inflation assumption 0.25% Increase by 2.6% Decrease by 2.2% Life expectancy One year Increase by 3.8% Decrease by 3.8% The above sensitivity analyses have been determined by changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
This is unlikely to be the case in practice as changes in some of the assumptions could be correlated.
When calculating the above sensitivities the same method has been applied as when calculating the net defined benefit asset liability in the balance sheet i. e. the present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Plan assets are comprised as follows: 2016 2015 m m Equities Properties 149.5 139.8 Bonds Gilts 201.8 272.9 Cash Other 13.0 21.2 Buy-in policy matching annuities 179.1 48.8 543.4 482.7 The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 76.8 million 2015: 37.6 million.
A proportion of the defined benefit obligation has been secured by a buy-in policy and as such this proportion of liabilities is matched by annuities.
The Trustees of the plan hold a range of assets and are aiming to better align the cash flows from these to those of the plan.
They are also working with the Group to fide-risk their portfolio further.
To this end changes to the allocation of assets have occurred during the current period.
The Group is aiming to eliminate the plans funding deficit in the medium term.
A schedule of contributions was agreed as part of the 30September 2014 triennial valuation and contributions of 0.5 million per month are payable until 30 September 2018 as well as contributions in respect of the plans expenses.
These contributions may continue until 2030 depending on the plans funding position.
The Group has also agreed to pledge additional security for six years from 2015.
The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 September 2017.
The employer contributions expected to be paid during the financial period ending 30 September 2017 amount to 7.6 million.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 18 years.
Post-retirement medical benefits A gain of 0.1 million 2015: nil in respect of the remeasurement of post-retirement medical benefits has been included in the statement of comprehensive income.
