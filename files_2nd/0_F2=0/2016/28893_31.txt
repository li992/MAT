Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 95 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES RPC Group Plc the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
Both the Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of these approved financial statements.
The following principal accounting policies apply to both the Group and Company financial statements.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Companys financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements, which are presented in sterling, are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments and deferred and contingent consideration which are stated at their fair value.
In the preparation of the financial statements, comparative amounts have been restated to reflect the following: The segmental revenues and results by process and geography to reflect the reorganisation of the internal management structure of the business.
The fair value adjustment to debt items is reported in bank overdrafts and other borrowings and not disclosed within long term derivatives.
Overdraft positions have been reported within short term liabilities and are no longer offset against cash balances where legal right of set off does not exist.
The provisional Promens acquisition accounting has been reviewed and hindsight adjustments made to goodwill, provisions, current and deferred tax and property, plant and equipment.
These have been adjusted in the comparative balance sheet.
Key Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key estimates and judgements used in the financial statements are as follows: Acquisition accounting IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the consideration for an acquisition is recorded at fair value.
Where contingent consideration is part of the acquisition cost then management have estimated the fair value of the amount payable.
Contingent consideration is revalued each reporting period according to the latest forecasts of the acquired business based on the terms of the earn-out arrangement.
Where deferred consideration is part of an acquisition cost then it is recorded and held on the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Where payment is dependent on the recipient remaining in employment, the payment will be accounted for as post-acquisition remuneration as required under IFRS 3 and be classified as exceptional remuneration expense over the earn-out period.
This is also held at fair value and revalued each reporting period.
Assets and liabilities must also be recognised at fair value on acquisition.
The identification and measurement of contingent liabilities, out-of-market contracts and intangible assets are key areas of judgement.
For intangible assets appropriate valuation methods are used, including royalty rates and the excess earnings model to recognise the fair value of the assets acquired.
More details are set out in note 26.
Exceptional and other non-underlying items The directors believe that the presentation of the results after adjusting for exceptional and non-underlying items assists in comparing trends and with improving an understanding of business performance.
The company has developed a policy of accounting treatment and disclosure which is consistently applied in identifying these costs and revenues which in some situations require judgement as to their amount and the appropriateness of their classification.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets Intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment and the Groups tangible assets other than inventories, financial assets within the scope of International Accounting Standard IAS 39 and deferred tax assets, are tested when there is an indication of impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out below and in note 12 to the financial statements.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash-generating unit and discount rates based on a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assumptions of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit.
RPC Group Plc 96 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Retirement benefit obligations The costs and present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend upon such factors as life expectancy of the members, wage rate increases of current employees, the returns that the schemes assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the pension liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on past experience and actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and in determining the discount rate.
The accounting policy is set out under Employee Benefits below and details of the assumptions used are set out in note 29 to the financial statements.
Taxation There are many transactions whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group makes provision for anticipated tax consequences based on the likelihood of whether additional taxes may arise.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
If these estimates do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which losses might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset or liability will be revised in a future period.
The accounting policy for taxation is set out below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidation includes the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 March 2016.
Where subsidiaries are acquired during the year, their results are included in the Groups financial statements from the date of control.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Acquisition Accounting Acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
A systematic approach is taken to identify the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree, and to measure them at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests, using appropriate valuation methods and third party valuation specialists where appropriate.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
New Standards and Interpretations In the current year there were no new standards adopted that had a material impact on the Group results.
In the prior year the Group adopted IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
As a result a joint venture previously proportionally consolidated is now being accounted for under the equity method.
There are a number of standards and interpretation issued by the IASB that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period, including IFRS9, IFRS 15 and IFRS16.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact that the application of these standards will have on the Groups financial statements.
Property, Plant and Equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost together with any incidental expenses of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment less any residual value on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Plant and equipment 5 to 12 years Moulds 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Non-current Assets Disposal Groups Held for Sale Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities, or disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when a sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale which is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 97 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for resale, the average purchase price is used.
For finished goods, cost is taken as production cost which includes the cost of the raw materials and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Financial Assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and derivatives.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to sell the asset, and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Investments in Subsidiaries Investments are stated at the fair value of the consideration given when initially acquired adjusted for capital contributions in respect of share options granted to employees of its subsidiaries and reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign Currencies Trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling when the transaction was entered into.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the balance sheet and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Since converting to IAS and as permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has reported the differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of foreign operations, the effective portion of foreign currency borrowings used in a net investment hedge, and the translation of the results of those companies at the average rate within the translation reserve and has reported the transactions inthe Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Prior to 2005, these items were recognised in retained reserves.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Bank Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums paid on settlement or redemption of direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
RPC Group Plc 98 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The fair values are determined by reference to the market prices available from the market on which the instruments involved are traded.
Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Fair value of Level 2 financial instruments is determined using valuation techniques.
Fair value of Level 3 financial instruments are where inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups treasury policy.
Hedges are classified as follows: Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Net investment hedges that hedge exposure to changes in the value, due to fluctuations in exchange rates, of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge, as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is recognised in equity, directly in the cash flow hedge reserve or the translation reserve, respectively, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Where a Group company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements for them as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Revenue Revenue, which excludes value added tax, other sales taxes and trade discounts, represents the invoiced value of goods supplied.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when products and associated equipment are supplied to external customers in line with contractual arrangements.
In these instances, significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to third parties, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Non-underlying Items Items which are non-underlying are presented separately from underlying business performance in the Consolidated income statement due to their materiality, nature or infrequency.
The separate reporting of non-underlying items helps facilitate comparison with prior periods and assess trends in financial performance.
The principal events which may give rise to items include business restructuring and closure costs, including related asset impairments and trading losses during the closure period, business acquisition and integration costs, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses and property, goodwill impairments, significant litigation and tax claim and other gains or losses, which, in the managements judgement, could distort an assessment of underlying business performance.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the current taxes payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 99 Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are some transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Employee Benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
The obligation is calculated by external actuaries using the projected unit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity and recognised in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The costs of providing accrued service benefits are charged to operating expenses.
Employee benefit net finance expense is included in net financing costs.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
Termination benefits The Group recognises the present value of a liability to pay termination benefits when it has a demonstrable commitment to terminating employment before retirement.
In Germany, the Group has contractual obligations under a part-time employment scheme for older employees Altersteilzeit.
In addition to half salary, the employee may receive a fixed incentive payment.
The Group provides for the incentive payment as a termination benefit.
The number of employees who will take up this arrangement is an estimate based on historical experience and any agreed cap on the number of participants.
Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other employee benefits The Group provides for the present value of its obligations in respect of other long-term employee benefits using actuarial valuations.
These include deferred salaries due to German Altersteilzeit employees and long service awards.
The Group provides for long service awards as they accrue.
The number of employees who will receive long service awards is estimated based on historical experience.
The costs of short-term employee benefits are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
Leasing Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental charges are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease.
Research and Development Expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Where the expenditure relates to the development of a new product or process which is expected to be technically feasible and commercially viable, development costs are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives, to a maximum of five years.
The intangible assets are assessed for indications of impairment annually and any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition.
The carrying amount is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested at least annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be reversed subsequently.
RPC Group Plc 100 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 1.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 which has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement in the year of acquisition.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Patents remaining life of patent Product development costs over the life of the project Computer software and IT systems development costs 4 to 5 years Customer contacts and relationships acquired 5 to 10 years Technology 7 years Brands 10 years The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date.
The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase cost and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.
Computer software costs that are directly associated with the implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories, financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 and deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses in respect of assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Equity-Settled Share-Based Payments The Group operates an employee savings related share option scheme and executive share option schemes.
The fair value of employee share options granted is calculated at grant date using an appropriate option pricing model.
The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options with a corresponding increase in equity.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its service and non-market estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and the charge to the income statement is adjusted accordingly.
Where the Company grants share options to employees of its subsidiaries, the amount equal to the amount which would otherwise have been charged in the income statement in respect of those options is accounted for as a capital contribution and the Companys cost of investment in its subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Non GAAP Measures The Group presents adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share information as it believes these measures provide a helpful indication of its performance and underlying trends.
The term adjusted refers to the relevant measure being reported before non-underlying items, the amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets and non-underlying finance costs.
These measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and as a basis for incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The terms adjusted and non-underlying items are not defined terms under IFRS and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to, GAAP measurements of performance.
Related Party Disclosures Transactions between the Group and any related parties which require disclosure under IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures are given in note 30.

OPERATING SEGMENTS The information reported to the Groups Board of Directors, considered to be the Groups chief operating decision maker for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance, was previously based on manufacturing conversion process.
Following the acquisition of Promens the Group has been reorganised and is no longer managed by conversion process.
Since a number of the new operating segments meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8, they have been amalgamated into one reporting segment, Packaging.
In particular they are considered to have the same economic characteristics as they are similar businesses primarily operating within the European market.
The remaining operating segments have been included as Non-packaging.
The business performance of the two segments can be found in the Operating review on page 26.
Segment Revenues and Results The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies in note 1.
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment with an allocation of central items.
Pricing of inter-segment revenue is on an arms length basis.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that acquisition.
The Group tests at least annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The CGUs have been determined at a divisional level within the Group and the carrying value of goodwill at 31 March is allocated as follows: 2016 2015 restated m m Bramlage 128.9 93.3 Bebo 10.7 9.2 Superfos 95.8 69.3 Ace 175.9 170.0 Promens 130.3 158.0 GCS 285.5 827.1 499.8 The directors determined that no impairment was required as the recoverable amounts were in excess of the carrying value.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from their value in use.
The cash flow projections used in these calculations cover a three year period based on the 2016 17 budget and the outline plans for 2017 18 and 2018 19 approved by the Board together with terminal values which assume zero growth, with the exception of Ace which assumes a 4% terminal growth.
The key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations include: i Sales.
Forecasts are based on divisional level analysis of sales, markets, competitors and prices for the budget period.
Consideration is given to past experience, knowledge of future contracts and expectations of future potential changes in the markets.
ii Polymer and electricity costs.
Forecasts for polymer costs are based on prices at the time the budget is prepared.
Forecasts for electricity costs are based on contractual arrangements taking into account supply and demand factors.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2015: 10% was used to discount the expected cash flows of the cash-generating units.
As each CGU is considered to have similar risks the same discount rate has been applied, with the exception of Ace where a 12% rate has been used.
The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and profitability levels.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, an increase in the discount rate to 14% or a reduction in profitability of 8.8% would be required to indicate a potential impairment in one or more of the CGUs.
Management does not view that this is a reasonable possibility Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include customer contacts with a net book value of 133.9m 2015: 51.3m, brands with a net book value of 2.8m 2015: 2.1m, technology of 14.3m 2015: 8.7m and internally generated development costs with a net book value of 11.7m 2015: 9.3m.

These have been partitioned into separate elements and have been accounted for as 10 net investment hedges relating to GBP:EUR currency risk, 5 fair value hedges covering interest rate and currency exposure and 10 cash flow hedges.
i Cash Flow Hedges Cash Flow hedges are in place to manage interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk in relation to $100m of fixed rate debt, as well as the foreign exchange risk in relation to the fixed GBP margin payable on an additional $100m of external debt.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of USD to GBP cross currency interest rate swaps taken out to manage this risk was 9.7m 2015: 7.5m.
In the year, 1.9m was recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve to offset FX movements on retranslation of the $100m fixed rate debt.
The hedge reserve will be recycled to the income statement to offset FX movements on retranslation and repayment in 2018 and 2021.
Additionally, the Group also entered into 5 forward currency contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk in relation to the purchase of Global Closure Systems group.
These contracts were settled on 29th March 2016, so did not have a fair value at year end.
At settlement, these swaps had a fair value of 9.4m, which was recycled to the Balance Sheet to offset against consideration paid for Global Closure Systems.
ii Fair Value Hedges Fair Value hedges are in place to manage interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk in relation to an additional $100m of floating rate debt.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of USD to GBP cross currency interest rate swaps taken out to manage this risk was 9.8m 2015: 7.2m.
In the year, a movement in fair value of 2.5 m was noted on the hedged item, with an adjustment of 5.5m recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve for historic differences in hedge accounting treatments.
No ineffectiveness was noted on fair value hedges during the year 2015: nil.
iii Net Investment Hedges Net Investment hedges are in place to manage foreign exchange rate risk on the retranslation of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries.
The Group has designated 10 GBP to EUR cross currency interest rate swaps as Net Investment hedges, which have a fair value at the balance sheet date of 9.2m 2015: 19.4m.
Additionally, external debt of $16m and 60m is also designated as a hedging instrument in hedge relationships.
No ineffectiveness was noted on net investment hedges during the year 2015: nil.
Cross currency interest rate swaps included within Net Investment hedges at a consolidated level are included within fair value hedges within company accounts.
No ineffectiveness 2015: none was noted on these fair value hedges within the year RPC Group Plc 118 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 22.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Other smaller foreign exchange contracts are used to manage the Groups exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments and external borrowings to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Groups risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
The Groups policies and the risks associated with derivatives and financial instruments are as follows: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will affect the Groups net income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within parameters that are deemed to be acceptable, while optimising return.
Generally, the Group seeks to minimise this risk through hedging arrangements designed to manage a proportion of the Groups overall exposure.
The Group does not actively engage in trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes.
b Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a balanced position in respect of its fixed and floating borrowings, using derivative instruments where relevant.
The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt is shown in note 20.
With respect to the $216m USPP notes issued in December 2011, $100m was converted from fixed US dollar to floating GBP and $100m was converted from fixed US dollar to fixed GBP, through the use of ten cross currency interest rate swaps: three of these swaps totalling $92m expire in December 2018 with the remaining two, totalling $108m, expiring in December 2021.
The remaining USPP balance of $16m and notes of 60m are not swapped and therefore pay interest at fixed US dollar and fixed euro interest rates.
An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on floating rate borrowings not fixed by interest rate swaps would have reduced profit before tax by approximately 3.9m 2015: 3.2m before accounting for exchange differences, and would reduce net equity by approximately 3.0m 2015: 2.4m.
2016 2015 Sterling Euro US dollar Sterling Euro US dollar % % % % % % Fixed interest rate 2.54.4 2.011.2 4.24.8 3.0 2.55.0 4.34.8 Floating rate interest margin above: Euribor n a 0.84.5 n a n a 0.32.7 n a Libor 1.12.5 n a 1.21.8 1.01.8 n a 1.01.8 Interest received on cash balances is at normal commercial floating rates.
c Liquidity risk The Group monitors and reviews its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 20 at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
The maturity profile of the Groups undrawn borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at 31 March 2016, but excluding overdrafts, is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Maturity date Expiring in one year 0.8 Expiring in one to two years 0.1 Expiring in more than two years 210.9 267.6 211.8 267.6 The maturity of bank loans and overdrafts is set out in note 20.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 119 In order to improve liquidity and ensure continuity of funding, the Group has a credit agreement with seven recognised international banks providing a 770m multicurrency revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2020.
During 2011 the Group issued $92m and 35m USPP notes expiring in December 2018 and $124m and 25m USPP notes expiring in December 2021.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through additional overdraft facilities.
The table below analyses the Groups contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to non-derivative financial liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis if their contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to protect the Groups Balance Sheet and Income Statement from the adverse effect of changes in the exchange rate relating to both transactional and translational risk.
Exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is minimised by trading in the subsidiaries local currencies wherever possible and by the use of forward exchange contracts as appropriate.
Of the Groups net assets, 88% 2015: 91% before borrowings are in non sterling currencies, 49% of which are denominated in euros.
In December 2011 the Company issued $216m and 60m fixed rate USPP notes.
In order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange exposure, 10 cross currency interest swaps were taken out totalling $200m.
In order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk on payment of interest and principal balances, the debt is designated within cash flow and fair value hedges.
RPC Group Plc 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 March 2016 22.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The remaining $16m and 60m of the USPP notes was designated within Net Investment hedge relationships.
Additionally, ten GBP to EUR cross currency interest rate swaps were designated within Net Investment hedges to manage translation risk in relation to the assets of subsidiaries denominated in non-sterling currencies.
The exchange gains or losses on these borrowings are included in the FX reserve within the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates on the translation of profits earned by its overseas subsidiaries.
The estimated impact of the change in average exchange rates between 2015 and 2016 on the profit before tax has resulted in a net increase to the 2016 result of approximately 5.2m 2015: net reduction of 5.2m.
The main currency that drives this change is the euro.
Movements in US dollar and other exchange rates were less significant.
A movement of 1% in the value of sterling against other foreign currencies mainly the euro would result in a translational impact on the Groups profit before tax ofapproximately 1.7m 2015: 0.9m and on the Groups net assets of 8.9m 2015: 7.2m.
The closing rate of exchange for the euro at 31 March 2016 was 1.26 2015: 1.37 and for the US dollar was $1.44 2015: $1.48.
The average rate of exchange forthe euro for 2016 was 1.37 2015: 1.27 and for the US dollar $1.51 2015: $1.61.
e Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from amounts receivable from customers and deposits of cash made with financial institutions.
The Group monitors its credit risk with its customers and only uses financial institutions as counter-parties that have an investment grade credit rating.
The methods used to evaluate customers credit worthiness are described in more detail in note 17.
Capital Management The Board defines capital as the equity of the Group.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital employed and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages wide employee participation and motivation through equity based incentive schemes.
Details of the current Sharesave and Executive Share Option Schemes and the Performance Share Plan, together with shareholding guidelines, are given in the Remuneration report.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Liabilities The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt is shown in note 20.
The Groups floating rate loans bear interest based on Libor or Euribor.
The floating rate borrowings under the banking facilities are typically rolled over for a period of three months or less, based on the appropriate Libor Euribor rate.
With respect to the USPP notes, $100m of the $216m issued in December 2011 was converted from fixed US dollar to floating euro by the use of five cross currency interest rate swaps: three of these swaps totalling $50m expire in December 2018 with the remaining two, totalling $50m, expiring in December 2021.
These were in place at the year end with a market value of 28.7m 2015: 34.1m.
An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings not fixed by interest rate swaps would have reduced profit before tax by approximately 3.9m 2015: 3.2m before accounting for exchange differences, and would reduce net equity by approximately 3.0m 2015: 2.4m.

The fair values of the interest rate, foreign currency and cross currency interest rate swaps have been determined by reference to the market price available from the market on which the instruments are traded.
In both 2016 and 2015, all financial instruments measured at fair value are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, whereby the fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
Level 3 inputs are inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the USPP is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Contingent consideration and acquisition remuneration note 23 is held at fair value which is estimated based on latest forecasts by the Ace cluster.
The Group does not hold any Level 1 instruments measured at fair value.

The Acquisition remuneration is for vendors of Ace and Strata Products who remain in employment and is therefore classified as post-acquisition remuneration under IFRS 3.
All payments to the vendors of Ace are in US dollars and are linked to the performance of Ace measured against an EBITDA growth target over the period to December 2017.
These are held at fair value estimated using Level 3 inputs described in note 22.
During the year a write back of 18.9m has been made to the Ace deferred consideration to reflect the current view of the final payment that is due to be made in December 2017.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Funded Retirement Benefit Obligations United Kingdom The main retirement benefit obligation in the UK is a defined benefit pension scheme, called the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme.
This provides retirement benefits to some former employees and approximately 28% 2015: 34% of current UK employees.
The scheme provides members with benefits based on a three-year average of final pensionable salary and total pensionable service.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term liabilities for past and present employees.
The corporate trustee, which is independent from the Group, has a duty to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustee directors is determined by the schemes corporate and trust documentation and by statute.
All trustee directors are members of the pension scheme and one-third are nominated by current and pensioner members.
Subject to statute, the principal employer, RPC Containers Limited, on the advice of the scheme actuary and in consultation with the trustee, determines the contributions to the scheme.
In addition, in the event that any of the members employing companies are unable to pay their contributions, the trustee may call upon guarantees provided by RPC Group Plc in respect of certain present and future liabilities of the members employing companies in the UK.

The Netherlands In the Netherlands there are a number of defined benefit retirement plans.
These are funded by contributions to insurance policies or a separately administered fund.
There were five pension plans in the Netherlands providing career average four plans or final salary one plan pensions and disability benefits under contracts with insurance companies.
Active employees pay a proportion of the premiums charged by the insurance company.
The IAS 19 liability and service costs for the remaining DB plans are calculated by local actuaries by rolling forward the latest data available from the insurance companies and current salary data from the relevant RPC subsidiary.
One of the plans was acquired as a result of the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s in respect of a former business in the Netherlands and current Dutch employees of Superfoss German operation.

Multi-Employer Plans Certain Group employees in the Netherlands and Sweden participate in multi-employer or industry-wide defined benefit pension plans as follows: Number of current employees participating 2016 2015 Stichting Beheer  OWASE 30 33  Branche Pensioenregeling Dutch Plastics Industry Plan 56 62 Swedish ITP2 Plan 20 24 The Group is not a significant participant in any of these plans.
In respect of all three multi-employer plans, there is no contractual agreement between the multi-employer plan and their participants that would determine how any surpluses or deficits will be distributed or funded.
Employer contributions are fixed by the plans governing bodies for all participating employers.
It is not possible to separately identify within the plans the assets and liabilities which relate to RPC Group employees.
Therefore, the Group accounts for the plans as defined contribution arrangements.
The core participating companies in the OWASE plan comprise the former owner of RPC Bebo Nederland, Goor, prior to its acquisition by RPC.
It provides career weighted average salary pension benefits accrued at the rate of 1.875% of annual pensionable salary.
The employer contributions are 21.0% of pensionable salary.
The latest information available on the funding status of the OWASE plan on the local funding valuation basis according to Dutch law indicates that the plan is in surplus.
Therefore, contributions for RPC are expected to remain at the current level.
The Dutch Plastics Industry Plan is a funded, defined benefit, career weighted average salary scheme providing benefits at the rate of 1.875% per annum of pensionable earnings.
The employer contribution was 15.0% of pensionable earnings from 1 January 2014.

The ITP2 Plan provides defined benefits based on final salary, including retirement, long-term disability and survivors pensions.
The pension level is around 65% of pay inclusive of social security for the average employee.
The Plan is insured with the insurer Alecta.
Employees do not contribute to the Plan and employer contributions are calculated individually in relation to age and salary level at rates selected by Alecta.
The latest information available on the funding status of the ITP2 Plan is shown in the table below.
As the Plan is in surplus, no increase in contributions is expected.
The latest published funding levels and the date on which they were measured are as follows: 2016 2015 Date Funding Level Date Funding Level OWASE 31 December 2015 104.9% 31 December 2014 115.0% Plastics Industry Plan 31 December 2014 105.6% 31 December 2014 105.6% ITP2 Plan 31 March 2016 144.0% 31 March 2015 148.0% The expense recognised in the Consolidated income statement for these multi-employer plans is equal to the contributions due for the year and is not included in the above retirement benefit obligations.
The cost for the year is included in defined contribution plan charges in staff costs note 5.
