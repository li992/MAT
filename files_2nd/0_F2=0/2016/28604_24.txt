a Impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
In addition, the Group classifies casino licences with the exception of its concessions in Belgium and Spanish bingo licences as intangible assets with an indefinitelife.
i Goodwill At 30 June 2016, the Group has goodwill with a carrying value of 134.3m 30 June 2015: 134.3m.
Digital goodwill 53.4m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rank Digital Limited.
All of this goodwill is allocated to the Mecca digital CGU for the purposes of impairmenttesting.
In respect of the Mecca digital CGU, the recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the Groups budget for 2016 17, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2015: 2.0% thereafter.
Both the Groups budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board ofdirectors.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are settled stakes, gaming win margins, gaming duty and the discount rate.
Settled stakes represent monies placed by customers for interactive games and are estimated taking into account the product mix and industry developments.
Gaming win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated changes in the budget period.
Gaming duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheetdate.
As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill.
The key factors which impact the calculation of the carrying valueinclude: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Settled stakes, Gaming win margin Poor or decreased marketing activity Settled stakes Failure to respond to technological advances Settled stakes Deterioration in economic conditions Settled stakes Changes in regulation Settled stakes, Gaming win margin Changes in duties Gaming duty The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 116 Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by in excess of 77m.
Whilst this represents significant headroom this reflects high growth consistent with industry forecasts and recent market trends.
If this was not to be achieved it could adversely impact the carrying value.
A decrease of approximately 17% in either settled stakes or gaming win would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
A rise in gaming duty from 15% to approximately 19% would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
These calculations assume all other assumptions remain constant and therefore do not reflect any cost saving measures that may be identified should a key assumption be impacted to thismagnitude.
Casino goodwill 80.9m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos from Gala Coral in May 2013.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is considered to benefit all acquired casinos and therefore is tested by combining all of the acquired casino CGUs.
The discount rate applied to the casino goodwill is that applied to Grosvenorvenues.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections of the combined casinos from the Groups budget for 2016 17, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2015: 2.0% thereafter.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to casinos and have been based on historic trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent per visit on gaming tables, machines and food and beverages.
This has also been determined by historic trends.
Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino.
The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current levels without indexation.
Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certaincriteria.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Theseare: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount by 113m.
A decrease of approximately 22% in either customer visits or spend per visit would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
A rise in gaming-related taxes from the current blended rate of 18.5% to 24% across the combined casinos would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU.
ii Casino licences The carrying value of indefinite life casino licences as at 30 June 2016 was 231.9m 30 June 2015: 231.9m.
The inherent value of a casino licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of a casino as a whole and is therefore not split out from each casino in an impairment review.
Each casino has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each casino, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use has been determined using cash flow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years for freehold properties, based on the Groups budget for 2016 17, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2015: 2.0% thereafter.
Both the Groups budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors.
Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by experienced senior management supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, where applicable, offersreceived.
com 117 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Impairment review continued The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to the casino and have been based on historic trends.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of individual licences to exceed their recoverable amount.
Theseare: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty As outlined above, each casino licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole.
The level by which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeds its carrying amount therefore varies at each venue and the impact of changes in key assumptions that would be required for the recoverable amount to equal its carrying amount also varies at each casino.
For UK casino licences, the directors do not believe that, with the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a UK casino licence, there are any reasonably foreseeable changes to the key assumptions that would result in a materialimpairment.
No impairment charges were made during the year against indefinite life casino licences year ended 30 June 2015: nil.
The two casino concessions in Belgium are being amortised over their expected useful life.
At 30 June 2016 these concessions had a carrying value of 3.8m 30 June 2015: 4.2m.
Each of the casino concessions has also been treated as a separate CGU for impairment testingpurposes.
iii Spanish bingo licences The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 30 June 2016 was 7.4m 30 June 2015: 5.0m.
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is not therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in an impairment review.
Each individual bingo club has been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis.
The recoverable amount of each Spanish bingo club, including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use calculation has been determined using cash flow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years in the case of freehold properties, based on the Groups budget for 2016 17, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2015: 2.0%, thereafter.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, bingo duty and the discount rate.
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends.
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money net of winnings spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and beverages.
This has been determined by recent trends.
Bingo duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheetdate.
As a result of the impairment review, an impairment reversal of 1.4m 30 June 2015: 1.8m has been recognised against the value in use of one bingo licence.
However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that could cause further impairments.
Theseare: Key factors Key assumption impacted Increased or improved competition Customer visits Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit Changes in duties Bingo duty As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested for impairment as part of the club as a whole.
Accordingly, the sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from changes in the key assumptions, varies at each club.
For the clubs previously impaired, each one percentage point reduction in expected future cash flow projections would generate an incremental impairment of 0.1m.
The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 118 b Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are grouped into CGUs which are defined as individual venues for Mecca, Enracha and Grosvenor Casinos and as the Grosvenor Casino digital and Mecca digital businesses.
Each CGU is assessed for indicators of impairment.
The indicator of impairment that resulted in a charge was a sustained deterioration in trading performance.
The indicator that resulted in a reversal was a sustained improvement in tradingperformance.
The key assumptions and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are the same as outlined above for intangibleassets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The value in use has been determined using cash flow projections from the Groups budget for 2016 17, the Groups strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 30 June 2015: 2.0% thereafter.
Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by an experienced surveyor supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable, offers received.
For a limited number of CGUs any failure to achieve the anticipated growth in future performance could result in further impairment charges beingmade.

com 123 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group has other receivables and cash and short-term deposits that derive directly from itsoperations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidityrisk.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financialperformance.
The Groups senior management oversees the management of these risks.
The finance committee is supported by the Groups senior management that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.
The finance committee provides assurance that the Groups financial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and the financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and Group riskappetite.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarisedbelow.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings anddeposits.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the positions at 30 June 2016 and 30 June2015.
The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are allconstant.
i Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Groups operating activities when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Groups functional currency and the Groups net investments in foreignsubsidiaries.
Group policy is not to hedge foreign currencyrisk.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a possible change in the US Dollar and euro, with all other variables held constant, to the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity.
The effect on equity, other than the effect of profit before tax, includes the impact of translation of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is notmaterial.
Increased volatility in exchange rates has resulted in the level of sensitivity being increased to 15% year ended 30 June 2015: 10% Effect on profit before tax Effect on equity As at As at As at As at 30 June 2016 30 June 2015 30 June 2016 30 June 2015 m m m m Change in foreign exchange rates: 15.0% US$ 1.3 1.1 -15.0% US$ 1.8 1.5 15.0% euro 0.1 4.2 6.0 -15.0% euro 0.1 4.2 6.0 Change in foreign exchange rates: 10.0% US$ 0.9 0.8 -10.0% US$ 1.1 1.0 10.0% euro 2.7 4.0 -10.0% euro 0.1 2.7 4.0 The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 124 ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups obligations with floating interestrates.
Historically the Group had managed its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
Due to the current economic climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside the Group policy of maintaining between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 30 June 2016, 19% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest 30 June 2015: 14%.
iii Interest rate sensitivity The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of loans, borrowings, cash and short-termdeposits.
Effect on profit before tax As at As at 30 June 2016 30 June 2015 m m Sterling: 100 basis point increase 0.6 0.8 200 basis point increase 1.2 1.6 There was no impact on equity in either year as a consequence of loanarrangements.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year.
As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not beenpresented.
The Group did not enter into any fixed-to-floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps in eitheryear.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily for other receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financialinstruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups treasury department in accordance with the Groups policy.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the finance director, and may be updated throughout the year subject to the approval of the Groups finance committee.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterpartyfailure.
The credit worthiness of each counterparty is checked against independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, with a minimum rating of BB required.
The Group predominantly invests with its lending banks whenappropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit and debit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is not .
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from non-performance of itscounterparties.
c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced three times a year.
The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different scenarios and are reviewed regularly.
Forecast financial headroom and debt covenant compliance are reviewed monthly during the month-end process to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-monthperiod.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
A three-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future financing needs.
Management actively manages the Groups financing requirements and the range of maturities on itsdebt.
The Groups core debt facilities are the 90.0m 30 June 2015: 80.0m bank revolving credit facility comprising three bi-lateral bank facilities which expire in September 2020 and the 80.0m 30 June 2015: 120.0m bank term loan facility comprising three bi-lateral bank facilities which expire in April 2019.
The Group proactively manages its relationships with its lendinggroup.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversified by source and maturity, and to maintain committed facilities sufficient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements.

1 The bank facility interest payments were based on current LIBOR as at the reporting date.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure continuing access to existing debt facilities and to manage the borrowing cost of those facilities in order to minimise the Groups interestcharge.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of leverage ratio.
The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by EBITDA.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including loans and borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and short-term deposits, accrued interest and unamortised facility fees.
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation from continuingoperations.
The leverage ratios at 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 were asfollows: As at As at 30 June 2016 30 June 2015 m m Total loans and borrowings note 18 102.2 143.1 Less: Cash and short-term deposits 61.0 89.6 Less: Accrued interest 0.5 0.7 Less: Unamortised facility fees 0.5 0.1 Net debt 41.2 52.9 Continuing operations Operating profit before exceptionals 82.4 84.0 Add: Depreciation and amortisation 45.8 42.3 EBITDA 128.2 126.3 Leverage ratio 0.3 0.4 Taking into consideration both the Groups capital investment requirements and the stability of the wider economic environment, the Group considers its progressive dividend policy to beappropriate.

Company The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of its cash and short term deposits of 0.2m 30 June 2015: 0.2m.
The Company does not have any other significant exposure to financialrisks.
