UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Section 2: Segment information Operating segments The Group considers that operating segments presented on a products and services basis are the most appropriate way to demonstrate the performance of the Group.
This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together the chief operating decision maker CODM, and reflects the way in which resources are allocated.
The CODM considers there to be four operating segments: Events which provide face-to-face interaction in the form of exhibitions, tradeshows, conferences and other live events: Marketing Services Online which provide website sponsorships and banner advertising as well as online directory and data products: Marketing Services Print which publishes magazines and trade press to specialist markets: and PR Newswire which provides communications products and services to professionals working in marketing, public relations, corporate communications or investor relations roles distributing messages, identifying target audiences and monitoring the impact.
As detailed in Section 1, the PR Newswire businesses which comprise the PR Newswire operating segment have been reported as discontinued operations as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
Marketing Services Online and Marketing Services Print have been aggregated to form one reportable segment Other Marketing Services.
