128 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 128 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements f Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If, in subsequent periods, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
g Dividends receivable Dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.
h Other receivables Current receivables are carried at the original amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost.
For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three months or less and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
j Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is classified as share premium.
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred to retained earnings.
k Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
com 129 Financial Statements Notes to the parent company financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 2 Significant accounting policies continued l Share-based payments Cash-settled transactions The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between reporting dates are recognised as an expense.
The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
Uncertainties in estimating the award include potential changes in the TSR, the number of participants in the plan, and levels of interest rates.
Where the Company is remunerating employees of its subsidiaries through a share-based payment, the costs of the transactions are recorded as capital contribution to the subsidiaries.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest.
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in personnel expenses.
During 2011 and 2014, the Company approved an equity-settled scheme for its CEO.
At the beginning of 2015, the Company granted a new benefit for some key employees of the Group, the Restricted Share Plan.
m Finance income and costs Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments.
Interest income and costs are recognised as they accrue, taking into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, respectively.
n Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes with the following exemptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
130 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 130 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements o Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it.
The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are guarantees provided by the Company on behalf of one of the Groups subsidiaries.
At inception the fair value of a financial guarantee is determined and recognised as a liability in the Companys accounts, while the debit is recognised as a capital contribution to its subsidiary.
The liability is subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee, unless it is considered probable that the guarantee will be called, in which case it is measured at the value of the guaranteed amount payable, if higher.
The liability is presented within creditors as Financial liability financial guarantee.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the statement of financial position date.
A detailed description of the Companys policies in respect of financial instruments is included in the Groups financial statements note 2 t. p Dividends distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.

Dollars using the year-end exchange rate both Level 1 inputs, to which a control premium was added based on recent market transactions a Level 2 input, and subsequently adjusted for the net debt held directly by the Company.

13 Financial risk management The Company is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have an impact on the achievement of financial and economic objectives.
These risks include strategic, operational and financial risk and are further categorised into risk areas to facilitate risk assessment.
The Company is not exposed to significant sources of commodity price, equity or interest rate risk.
a Foreign currency risk Due to the operations of the Company, it has cash and cash equivalents and trade payables denominated in pounds sterling and Canadian dollars.
Accordingly, the financial results of the Company may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.
The Company does not use derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risks.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date denominated in their respective currencies, to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax and the Companys equity.
Increase Effect decrease in on profit Effect US$ other before tax on equity Year currencies rate US$000 US$000 2016 Pound sterling -10% -35 2015 Pound sterling -10% - 39 b Credit risk The Company is primarily exposed to credit risk in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable at the statement of financial position date.
The Company has evaluated and introduced efforts to try to mitigate credit risk exposure.
To manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Company is: increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk: investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments term deposits : maintaining excess cash abroad in hard currency.
Credit risk concentrations exist when changes in economic, industrial or geographic factors take place, affecting in the same manner the Companys counterparties whose added risk exposure is significant to the Companys total credit exposure.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 6.
