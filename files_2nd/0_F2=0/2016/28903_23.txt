182 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1 Significant accounting policies RSA Insurance Group plc, the Company, incorporated in England and Wales, is the ultimate Parent Company of the RSA group of companies.
The principal activity of the Company is to hold investments in its subsidiaries and the receipt and payment of dividends.
These separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Except where otherwise stated, all figures included in the separate financial statements are presented in millions of Pounds Sterling Sterling, shown as m, rounded to the nearest million.
In accordance with section 408 of Companies Act 2006, the Companys income statement and related notes have not been presented in these separate financial statements.
The accounting policies that are used in preparation of these separate financial statements are consistent with the accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements of RSA Insurance Group plc as set out in those financial statements.
The additional accounting policies that are specific to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries The Company accounts for its investments in directly owned subsidiaries as available for sale financial assets, which are included in the accounts at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where there is a decline in the fair value of a directly owned subsidiary below cost, and there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, the cumulative loss that has been recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Adoption of new and revised standards The Company will apply IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in its separate financial statements during the year ending 31 December 2018.
In these financial statements, it will not be able to use the option permitted by the amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to defer the adoption of IFRS 9 as the Parent Companys activities are not predominantly connected with insurance as defined in IFRS 4.
The main impact of the IFRS 9 is that the Company will recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses on of amounts owed by subsidiaries, at their date of initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date.
If IFRS 9 had been adopted during 2016, there would not have been a significant impact on the Companys financial position or on its results for the year.

The Companys investments are classified as Level 2 financial assets.
Fair value of the Companys significant subsidiary is determined by reference to the market value derived from relevant indices of the Companys Ordinary Shares and loan capital instruments at the end of the reporting period, being the most transparent independent available indicator.
The market value is adjusted for the fair value of the Companys Preference Shares, assets and liabilities, excluding directly owned subsidiaries.
The adjusting items have been fair valued by determining the present value of future cashflow projections, using an appropriate arms length discount rate.
The remaining subsidiaries are held at fair value which has been determined to be net asset value.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2016 183 Financial statements Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued The subordinated loans to a subsidiary have the same terms as the external loan capital from which the loans to the subsidiary were financed.
The fair values of these loans are based on the quoted prices for the external loan capital.
The nominal values of the two loans are 78m 2015: 78m and 292m 2015: 492m with interest rates of 6.701% and 9.375% respectively.
The Directors believe that the methodology used supports the inclusion of the investments in subsidiaries in the statement of financial position, at the fair values ascribed to them.
The market value of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2016 was 5.86p.
A movement of 1% in the share price would have an impact of 60m on the fair value.
