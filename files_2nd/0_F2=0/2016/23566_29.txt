With effect from 1 January 2016, Essentra has implemented a new organisation structure, comprising three strategic business units.
The Components, Pipe Protection Technologies, Extrusion and Security businesses form a strategic business unit named Component Solutions.
The Speciality Tapes business is now included within the current Health & Personal Care Packaging strategic business unit.
The Filter Products and Porous Technologies businesses form a new strategic business unit named Filtration Products.
The scope of Central Services remains the same.

Income tax continued Income tax credit in the UK is 9.0m 2015: 0.7m expense.
This is primarily due to the trading performance and exceptional costs of the UK businesses.
1 The change in the weighted average applicable tax rate is caused by a change in the geographical balance of the Groups profits and by changes in corporate tax rates in these geographies and the impact of the impairment loss relating to the Health & Personal Care Packaging strategic business unit 2 This includes primarily depreciation on assets not qualifying for capital allowances and costs incurred in relation to the disposal of the Porous Technologies businesses.
Permanent disallowable items may vary in future years dependent on the nature of future expenditure 3 The impairment loss on goodwill of the Health & Personal Care Packaging strategic business unit is disallowable for tax purposes.

Intangible assets continued The weighted average useful economic lives of customer relationships and other intangible assets including Porous Technologies at the end of the year were 14.1 years and 8.9 years 2015: 14.2 years and 10.6 years respectively.
Essentra tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units as appropriate.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units, being the operating segments, as follows: Goodwill 2016 2015 Operating segment m m Component Solutions 93.3 74.0 Health & Personal Care Packaging 254.7 266.6 1 Filtration Products 31.4 26.6 379.4 367.2 1 These are included in assets in disposal group held for sale as at 31 December 2016 Intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are allocated to the businesses to which they relate as shown below: Customer relationships and other intangible assets 2016 2015 Business Operating segment m m Components Businesses of former Moss and Skiffy Component Solutions 17.5 12.6 Components Businesses of former Richco Component Solutions 35.2 32.8 Components Business of former Reid Supply Component Solutions 7.6 7.6 Components Business of former Mesan Component Solutions 11.8 13.1 Components Abric Component Solutions 11.6 10.9 Healthcare Europe Health & Personal Care Packaging 79.7 208.4 Healthcare Americas Health & Personal Care Packaging 46.6 Healthcare Asia Health & Personal Care Packaging 2.1 1 Porous St. Charles Filtration Products 3.3 4.0 1 Porous Chicopee Filtration Products 14.5 13.4 1 Porous Asia Filtration Products 1.9 1.8 Packaging Health & Personal Care Packaging 2.2 3.7 Speciality Tapes Health & Personal Care Packaging 8.2 12.7 Multiple businesses Multiple segments 11.2 3.4 253.4 324.4 1 These are included in assets in disposal group held for sale as at 31 December 2016 The Health & Personal Care Packaging business faced significant operational and commercial challenges during 2016.

Furthermore, there has been significant scaling back of high margin security feature business in the tear tape operations.
Issues were also experienced in the integration of the European speciality tapes activities into the European tear tapes business.
Intangible assets continued In the light of these events, management has performed a detailed impairment assessment of the assets in the Health & Personal Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit.
As a result of this impairment assessment, impairment losses were recognised for 32.5m of goodwill, 88.0m of customer relationship intangible asset and 3.4m of property, plant and equipment primarily plant and machinery.
The impairment assessment for intangible assets excluding goodwill and property, plant and equipment is performed on the cash generating units within the Health & Personal Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit.
The cash generating units are primarily the manufacturing sites.
Goodwill is tested at the strategic business unit level, which is the level that management monitor goodwill at.
The recoverable amount is estimated on the basis of value in use, i. e. discounted cash flow projection expected to be generated by the cash generating units.
For assets in the cash generating units assessed to be impaired, their fair value less costs to sell is also considered in determining the impairment loss to be recognised, if any.
In these cases the fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated market prices reflecting the age and condition of the asset.
The impairment tests for goodwill and intangible assets are based on the following assumptions: Cash flows for the next year are based upon the Groups annual Plan the Plan.
The key assumptions in the cash flow projections for the Plan are the revenue growth and operating margin for each strategic business unit.
Operating margin is primarily based on the levels achieved in 2016, which are disclosed in note 1, adjusted by targets set for revenue expansion and cost control and reduction for each individual division within the Plan period.
In relation to the test for the Health & Personal Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit, management carried out a more detailed assessment of the growth and profit margin assumptions for each of the next four years after the Plan period, and applied a terminal growth rate of 1.0%-1.5% subsequently.
The growth and profit margin assumptions are based on managements assessment of market condition and scope for cost and profitability improvement, taking into account realisable synergies following the recent integration activities.
In relation to the test for the Component Solutions Strategic Business Unit, cash flows beyond the Plan period are based on Plan cash flows with growth rates specific to each business of up to 2% 2015: up to 2%.
The estimated cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon Essentras estimated post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.2% 2015: 9.3%.
The specific pre-tax discount rates applied for each group of cash generating units to which significant goodwill is allocated are as follows: 10.6% for Health & Personal Care Packaging, 10.6% for Component Solutions and 10.6% for Filtration Products 2015: 16.2% for Distribution, 11.4% for Health & Personal Care Packaging and 12.7% for Specialist Technologies.
For the Filtration Products Strategic Business Unit, goodwill and intangible assets are held by Porous Technologies and none is held by Filter Products.
The impairment test for the intangible assets of Porous Technologies is carried out on the basis of fair value less costs to sell, to reflect the impending disposal.
The Group expects to realise a significant gain on the disposal of Porous Technologies based on the consideration agreed with the buyer, and therefore no impairment loss is required.
This transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2017.
Following the recognition of impairment losses in the Health & Personal Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit, a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will cause the carrying amount after impairment to exceed the recoverable amount, as follows: An increase in discount rate of 10 basis points would increase the impairment loss by 7.5m.
A reduction in terminal annual growth rate of 10 basis points would increase the impairment loss by 5.4m.
A reduction in each years growth rate by 10 basis points for the five-year projection period would increase the impairment loss by 5.4m.
A reduction of 100 basis points in the operating profit margin in the fifth year of the five-year period for the key locations impacted by impairment would increase the impairment loss by 13.7m.

Derivatives continued Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash flows.
They related to usual trading transactions in foreign currencies.
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur.
All of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months and all derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.
Essentra had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The exchange losses of 40.8m 2015: gains of 13.7m on the US dollar borrowings and the losses of 16.1m 2015: losses of 7.7m on the euro borrowings were recognised in other comprehensive income.

This arises as tax deductions are determined by the applicable tax laws in each country the Group operates in whereas accounting depreciation is calculated in line with the Groups accounting policy 2 A deferred tax liability is provided on temporary differences arising on the Group's intangible assets as in the majority of cases the local tax authorities do not allow deduction for the amortisation of these intangible assets.
The decrease during the year is due to the impairment loss relating to the Health & Personal Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit, partly offset by foreign exchange movements 3 This represents deferred tax on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and share-based incentives 4 This includes expenditure that will be deductible in future periods for tax purposes when the amounts are settled in cash, and withholding tax on overseas earnings from group companies expected to be remitted in the foreseeable future of 4.2m 2015: 3.0m 115 ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.

At the year end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas group companies will be remitted and a deferred tax liability of 4.2m 2015: 3.0m has been recognised accordingly.
This represents withholding taxes payable on the remittance of these earnings under local tax laws.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 113.7m as at 31 December 2016 2015: 102.0m, and the associated amount of unrecognised deferred tax is 11.7m 2015: 13.9m.
Based on available information, management determined whether it is probable for some or all of the deferred tax assets to be realised.
In determining this management considered the cumulative losses in prior years, the history of tax losses, the manner in which assets can be used including time limitations under local laws, future earnings potential and expectation of future reversal of taxable temporary differences.
Following management assessment, gross deferred tax assets of 0.2m 2015: 0.2m in respect of capital losses and unutilised tax losses of 46.1m 2015: 30.9m have not been recognised where their realisation is not considered probable.
The capital losses have an unlimited expiry date.
The tax losses expire as follows: 2.2m within 5 years, 6.1m in 5-10 years, nil in over 10 years and 37.8m with no expiry.
If future conditions change the amount of unrecognised gross deferred tax assets will be reassessed.
This may impact the income tax expense credit in that year.

Discontinued provisions in 2015 related to warranties made on the disposal of Globalpack, which was released in 2015.
Employee benefits Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The Group also has a number of other post-employment obligations in certain countries, some of which are required under local law.
The defined benefit plans are administered by boards of trustees and the assets are held independently from Essentra.
The boards of trustees comprise member nominated trustees, employer nominated trustees and independent advisory trustees.
The articles of the plans prohibit a majority on the boards to be established by either the member or employer nominated trustees.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2015 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recently completed actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
The principal European defined benefit schemes entitle remaining members to a pension calculated on 1.25% or 2% of their capped final pensionable pay multiplied by the number of pensionable years of service.
Some members have historical entitlements to accrual rates of 1.67%-1.9% and 3% for certain tranches of their service.
The principal US defined benefit schemes entitle certain participating employees to annuity benefits equal to 50% of final average pensionable salary, reduced for years of service less than 30, and other participating employees to annuity benefits equal to $49 per month for each year of service.
Employee benefits continued The amounts included in the consolidated Financial Statements are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Amounts expensed against operating profit Defined contribution schemes 6.2 6.7 Defined benefit schemes service cost 1.5 2.4 Defined benefit schemes curtailment gain 3.0 Other post-employment obligations 0.2 0.1 Total operating expense including discontinued operations 7.9 6.2 Amounts included as finance income expense Net interest on defined benefit scheme assets note 3 1.0 0.9 Net interest on defined benefit scheme liabilities note 3 1.2 1.1 Net finance expense including discontinued operations 0.2 0.2 Amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income Return on defined benefit scheme assets excluding amounts in net finance income 24.0 8.5 Impact of changes in assumptions and experience to the present value of defined benefit scheme liabilities 40.8 10.4 Remeasurement of defined benefit schemes including discontinued operations 16.8 1.9 During 2015, the principal defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US were closed to future accrual, and curtailment gains were recognised in profit or loss accordingly.
Following the closure of the Groups principal defined benefit pension schemes to future accruals, the schemes are funded by the Groups subsidiaries and employees are not required to make any further contribution.
The funding of these schemes is based on separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from those used in the valuation for IAS 19 purposes.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 are as follows: 2016 2015 Europe US Europe US 1 Increase in salaries pre-2010 n a n a n a 3.00% 1 Increase in salaries post-2010 n a n a n a 3.00% 1 Increase in pensions at RPI capped at 5% 3.30% n a 3.10% n a at CPI capped at 5% 2.40% n a 2.20% n a at CPI minimum 3%, capped at 5% 3.20% n a 3.30% n a at CPI capped at 2.5% 2.00% n a 1.80% n a Discount rate 2.70% 4.15% 3.80% 4.37% Inflation rate 2.90% n a 2.70% n a 1 For service prior to April 2010, pension at retirement is linked to salary at retirement.
For service after April 2010, pension is linked to salary at April 2010 with annual increases capped at 3% Due to the timescale covered, the assumptions applied may not be borne out in practice.

Employee benefits continued The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate defined benefit obligations at the year end are as follows: 2016 2015 Europe US Europe US Male retiring today at age 65 22.7 20.8 22.4 21.2 Female retiring today at age 65 24.5 22.8 24.8 23.2 Male retiring in 20 years at age 65 24.4 22.5 24.3 22.9 Female retiring in 20 years at age 65 26.4 24.4 26.7 24.9 The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustees investment policies.
The allocation of assets is arrived at taking into consideration current market conditions and trends, the size of potential returns relative to investment risk and the extent to which asset realisation needs to match liability maturity.
There are risks underlying these considerations.
If asset returns fall below the returns required for scheme assets to match the present value of scheme liabilities, a scheme deficit results.
Persistent deficits represent an obligation the Group has to settle through increased cash contributions.
If asset maturities are not properly matched with liability maturities, there is also the risk that the Group could be required to make unplanned short-term cash contributions to resolve resulting liquidity issues.
Scheme assets are invested by the trustees in asset classes and markets that are considered to be reasonably liquid, so this matching and liquidity risk is considered to be sufficiently mitigated.
The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the pension scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain, are: 2016 Europe US Total m m m Equities 32% 69.9 61% 34.5 104.4 Corporate bonds 18% 39.0 38% 21.6 60.6 Government bonds 50% 111.1 111.1 Other 0.9 1% 0.8 1.7 Fair value of scheme assets 220.9 56.9 277.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 212.3 86.6 298.9 Net retirement benefit assets obligations 8.6 29.7 21.1 2015 Europe US Total m m m Equities 32% 63.4 63% 30.3 93.7 Corporate bonds 18% 35.6 36% 17.6 53.2 Government bonds 50% 99.0 99.0 Other 0% 0.5 1% 0.3 0.8 Fair value of scheme assets 198.5 48.2 246.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 174.6 71.2 245.8 Net retirement benefit assets obligations 23.9 23.0 0.9 The equity, corporate bond and government bond assets are either direct investments or investments made via a managed fund for those asset classes.
All of these assets have a quoted market price in an active market.
The other asset class relates primarily to property and hedge funds, which are valued at their cumulative unit offer price.
No direct investment in property is held.
No plan assets are invested directly in the shares of Essentra plc.
Employee benefits continued The pension surplus in Europe is not restricted as the asset is considered realisable on the basis of the Groups unconditional right to a refund.
The average expected duration of the Groups European defined benefit pension liability at 31 December 2016 is 20.0 years 2015: 20.0 years.
The average expected duration of the Groups US defined benefit pension liability at 31 December 2016 is 12.8 years 2015: 12.9 years.
The Groups contributions to its defined benefit pension schemes are determined in consultation with trustees, taking into consideration actuarial advice, investment conditions and other local conditions and practices.
In 2017, the Group expects to make defined benefit contributions of $1.9m to its US schemes.
As the Groups European schemes are in a surplus position the Group does not expect to make further contributions in 2017.

Financial risk management Essentras activities expose the business to a number of key financial risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Essentras system of internal control and financial risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system.
Such a system can only be designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Essentra has a centralised treasury function to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
Essentra uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury function is subject to periodic independent reviews by the Group Assurance department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Treasury Committee.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographical presence, expertise and suitable credit rating.
The following describes Essentras financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Essentra has no significant individual concentrations of credit risk.
The following is an overview of how Essentra manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables Essentras exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers.
This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, including the industry and country in which customers operate.
Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek credit ratings as part of their normal course of business.
Essentra monitors significant customers credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective allowance takes account of historical experience and the profile of customers.
As at 31 December 2016, gross trade receivables including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale were 220.1m 2015: 229.2m of which 45.0m 2015: 43.7m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Up to three months 42.8 39.5 Over three months 2.2 4.2 45.0 43.7 As at 31 December 2016, trade receivables including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale of 4.7m 2015: 4.3m were provided for as they were considered to be impaired.

The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Essentra monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Essentra by classifying derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.
ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Essentra has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Essentra is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
124 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.
Financial risk management continued a Currency risk Essentra publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Essentras net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds through measures such as borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
Essentras US dollar denominated assets were approximately 32% 2015: 78% hedged by the US dollar denominated borrowings.
Essentras euro denominated assets were approximately 73% hedged by the euro denominated borrowings 2015: 58%.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Essentras transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and therefore transaction exposure is limited.
However, where such exposure does occur, Essentra uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 18 months.
Essentra does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are transferred either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective.

Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk Essentras strategy is to ensure that at least 30% of the total debt with maturities of more than one year is protected with fixed interest rates or approved interest rate derivatives.
The following table shows Essentras sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external floating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Essentras interest rate derivatives.

iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Essentra, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Essentras objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
Essentra is mostly funded by two series of US$80m US Private Placement Loan Notes from various financial institutions and syndicated multi-currency 5-year revolving credit facilities of 271.0m and 167.5m from its banks.
The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have original maturities of six and nine years and the revolving credit facilities mature in July 2019.
At 31 December 2016 the available bank facilities totalled 414.2m 2015: 394.2m of which 311.0m 2015: 295.5m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Amounts drawn by Essentra on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Essentras available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2016 2015 m m Expiring after two years 103.2 98.7 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.
A new term loan for 60m was signed on 4 January 2017 by the Group for a period up to 1.5 years.
Its terms and conditions are similar to the Groups existing facilities and is ranked pari-passu with these facilities.

All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.
Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Essentras accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale.

Financial risk management continued Total trade and other receivables including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale carried at 250.4m 2015: 254.0m include prepayments of 8.4m 2015: 8.5m and consideration paid in advance in respect of business acquisition of nil 2015: 1.7m which are not financial assets and are therefore excluded from the above analysis.
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
These are determined to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The only financial instrument with fair value determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, which is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is the deferred contingent consideration of 1.3m relating to the acquisition of Specialty Plastics and Kamsri 2015: 1.5m relating to the acquisition of Mesan Kilit A. S. and Specialty Plastics.
The fair value of the deferred contingent consideration is estimated based on an assessment of the likely outcome of the acquired business financial performance.
There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements.
During the year, a fair value gain of 1.1m 2015: fair value gain of 4.8m in respect of financial instruments at level 3 fair value hierarchy was recognised within exceptional items see note 2, and nil 2015: nil was settled in cash.
No other fair value gains or losses were recorded in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes.
The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of 128.7m 2015: 108.3m.
The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes at 31 December 2016 is 136.5m 2015: 117.4m.
All other financial assets, classified as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classified as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Unsecured bank loans, included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at floating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate their fair values at the reporting date.

Essentra sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Essentra manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Essentra may return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Essentra monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees.
During 2016, Essentras strategy, which was unchanged from 2015, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
128 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.

Full details are set out in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 71 to 82.
The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in these financial statements.
At 31 December 2016 the trust held 1,517,883 2015: 1,828,789 shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 0.4m 2015: 0.5m and market value of 7.0m 2015: 15.1m.
The Company holds 1,286,952 2015: 1,750,571 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 0.3m 2015: 0.4m in treasury.
This represents 0.5% 2015: 0.7% of the number of ordinary shares in issue.
The other reserve relates to the Group reorganisation, which took place as part of the fide-merger from Bunzl plc.
It represents the difference between Essentra plcs share capital and Essentra International Limiteds share capital and share premium on 6 June 2005 and is not distributable.
