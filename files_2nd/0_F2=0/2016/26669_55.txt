Revaluation impairment During the current and prior period various properties were reviewed for impairment and or material changes in value.
These valuation adjustments were recognised in the revaluation reserve or the income statement as appropriate.
At 1 February 2015 independent chartered surveyors revalued the Groups freehold and leasehold properties on an open market value basis.
These valuations were incorporated into the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments were recognised in the revaluation reserve or income statement as appropriate.
The impact of the revaluations impairments described above is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Income statement: Revaluation loss charged as an impairment 60.1 Reversal of past impairment 26.3 33.8 Revaluation reserve: Unrealised revaluation surplus 2.0 216.5 Reversal of past revaluation surplus 120.6 2.0 95.9 Net increase in shareholders equity property, plant and equipment 2.0 62.1 Fair value of land and buildings IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements of land and buildings have been categorised: 2016 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements m m m m m m m m Land and buildings: Specialised brewery properties 25.3 25.3 25.0 25.0 Other land and buildings 1,989.0 1,989.0 1,922.0 1,922.0 1,989.0 25.3 2,014.3 1,922.0 25.0 1,947.0 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
The Level 2 fair values of land and buildings have been obtained using a market approach, primarily using earnings multiples derived from prices in observed transactions involving comparable businesses.
The Level 3 fair values of the specialised brewery properties have been obtained using a cost approach.
These breweries represent properties that are rarely, if ever, sold in the market, except by way of a sale of the business of which they are part, due to the uniqueness arising from their specialised nature, design and configuration.
As such the valuation of these properties has been performed using the depreciated replacement cost approach, which values the properties at the current cost of replacing them with their modern equivalents less deductions for physical deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimisation.
The significant unobservable inputs to the Level 3 fair value measurements are: Sensitivity of fair value to unobservable inputs Current cost of modern equivalent asset The higher the cost the higher the fair value Amount of adjustment for physical deterioration obsolescence The higher the adjustment the lower the fair value 2016 2015 Level 3 recurring fair value measurements m m At beginning of the period 25.0 23.7 Additions 0.6 0.4 Revaluation 1.2 Depreciation charge for the period 0.3 0.3 At end of the period 25.3 25.0 The Groups properties are revalued by external independent qualified valuers at least once in each rolling three year period.
The last external valuation of the Groups freehold and leasehold properties was performed as at 1 February 2015.
The Group has an internal team of qualified valuers and at each reporting date the estate is reviewed for any indication of significant changes in value.
Where this is the case internal valuations are performed on a basis consistent with those performed externally.
