SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 118 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Significant accounting policies General information SEGRO plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given ontheinsideback cover.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in the Strategic Report onpages16to 17.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates i. e. the functional currency.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Groups financial statements also comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
In addition, the Group has also disclosed additional measures relating to the Best Practice Recommendations Guidelines issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate, as discussed further in Note 2.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 53.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivatives.
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new Interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2016.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
The following standards and amendments have been adopted by the Group and the Company for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2016: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20122014 Cycle Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: Bearer Plants Amendments to IAS 19: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20102012 Cycle The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the financial statements of the Group or the Company for the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements: Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of cash flows on disclosure initiative Amendments to IAS 12, Income taxes on Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses Amendments to IFRS 2, Share-based payments, on clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers Amendment to IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 16 Leases Amendments to IFRS 4, Insurance contracts regarding the implementation of IFRS 9, Financial instruments Amendment to IAS 40, Investment property relating to transfers of investment property Annual improvements 20142016 IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration Financial Statements 119 Overview Strategic Report Governance 1.
Significant accounting policies continued None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Group or Company.
Certain Standards which might have an impact are discussed below.
IAS 12, Income taxes was amended to clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the assets tax base.
Specifically, the amendments confirm that: i a temporary difference exists whenever the carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base at the end of the reporting period: ii an entity can assume that it will recover an amount higher than the carrying amount of an asset to estimate its future taxable profit: iii where the tax law restricts the source of taxable profits against which particular types of deferred tax assets can be recovered, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets can only be assessed in combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type: and, iv tax deductions resulting from the reversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from the estimated future taxable profit that is used to evaluate the recoverability of those assets.
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, however, is subject to endorsement by the EU.
At present the Group does not expect the amendment to have a material impact on its financial statements since it only arises where cost exceeds fair value for investment properties and even then assets are typically not recognised due to uncertainty over the reversal of such amounts.
The Group is monitoring fair value movements below cost to assess the impact of the amendment in future periods.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through the Income Statement.
The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI with no recycling.
There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.
For financial liabilities, there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in a companys own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests.
It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes.
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
At present the Group expects IFRS 9 to have an immaterial impact on the accounting for available-for-sale financial assets and derivatives, and an immaterial impact from the implementation of the expected loss model.
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18, Revenue and IAS 11, Construction contracts and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted.
At present the Group expects IFRS 15 to have an immaterial impact on the provision of services and management income that fall under the scope of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16, Leases was issued in January 2016.
For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of financial position, as the distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed.
Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases.
The accounting for lessors will not significantly change.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted, subject to EU endorsement.
At present the Group expects IFRS 16 to have an immaterial impact on its current accounting practices.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group or the Company.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 120 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at their proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured as its acquisition-date fair value.
Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, as appropriate, with thecorresponding gain or loss being recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group Income Statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans and derivatives that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the Income Statement when the operation is sold.
The principal exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in 2016 are: Balance Sheet: 1 1.17 31 December 2015: 1 1.36.
Income Statement: 1 1.22 2015: 1 1.38 Investment properties These properties include completed properties that are generating rent or are available for rent, and development properties that are under development or available for development.
Investment properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by independent professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the Income Statement.
As the Group uses the fair value model, as per IAS 40 Investment Properties, no depreciation is provided.
An asset will be classified as held for sale within investment properties, in line with IFRS 5 NonCurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, where there is Board approval at the year-end date and the asset is expected to be disposed of within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Other interests in property Other interests in property include the cost and related fees in respect of land options, which are initially capitalised and regularly tested for impairment.
The impairment review includes consideration of the resale value of the option and likelihood of achieving planning consent.
Trading properties These are properties being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is complete, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Trading properties are transferred to investment properties when there is a change in use evidenced by the commencement of an operating lease to another party, together with the intention to hold the property to generate rent, or for capital appreciation, or for both.
Property acquisitions and disposals Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the significant risks and rewards of ownership and as disposed when these are transferred to the buyer.
Generally this would occur on completion of contract.
Any gains or loss arising on fide-recognition of the property calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Financial Statements 121 Overview Strategic Report Governance Revenue Revenue includes gross rental income, joint venture management fee income, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Joint venture management fee income is recognised as income in the period to which it relates.
Rental income Rental income from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term rent averaging.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided atthe reporting date.
Where the Group acts as an agent, service charge income is netted against the relevant property operatingexpenses.
Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less depreciation.
Cost includes purchase price and any directly attributable costs.
Depreciation Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets other than investment properties less their residual values, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Plant and equipment 20% per annum Software 33% per annum Solar panels 5% per annum The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Financial instruments Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing for the relevant currency.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts in managing interest rate risk and currency risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the Income Statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged, and may go to other comprehensive income.
Derivatives with a maturity of less than 12 months or that expect to be settled within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date are presented as current assets or liabilities.
Other derivatives are presented as non-current assets or liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
An impairment provision is created for receivables where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are initially measured atfair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale AFS investments AFS investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to fair value.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the Income Statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement within other investment income.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 122 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Pensions Defined benefit schemes The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the Balance Sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the Income Statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future either through a cash refund or reduction in future payments is available.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in Note 21.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the Income Statement attheir fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that non-market-based performance conditions will not be met.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each Balance Sheet Date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Income tax Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the Balance Sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
No provision is made for temporary differences i arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than a business combination, that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and ii relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that suitable taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences canbe utilised.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty: Property valuations Valuation of property is a central component of the business.
In estimating the fair value, the Group engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation.
Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of the property portfolio is disclosed in Note 30 property valuation techniques and related quantitative information.
Significant areas of judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies: Accounting for significant acquisitions, disposals and investments Property transactions are complex in nature.
Management consider each material transaction separately with an assessment carried out to determine the most appropriate accounting treatment and judgements applied, including whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.
Revenue recognition In making its judgement over revenue recognition for cut-off for property transactions, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue set out in IAS 18 Revenue and, in particular, whether the Group had transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets disposed.
Management also consider the appropriate accounting treatment of tenant lease incentives.
Other less significant judgements and sources of uncertainty relate to estimating the fair value of financial instruments, provisioning and the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations.
Financial Statements 123 Overview Strategic Report Governance 2.
Adjusted profit Adjusted profit is a non-GAAP measure and is the Groups measure of underlying profit, which is used by the Board and senior management to measure and monitor the Groups income performance.
It is based on the Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines of European Public Real Estate Association EPRA, which calculate profit excluding investment and development property revaluations and gains or losses on disposals.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation, as well as other permitted one-off items, are also excluded.
Refer to the Supplementary Notes for all EPRA adjustments.
The Directors may also exclude from the EPRA profit measure additional items gains and losses which are considered by them to be non-recurring, unusual or significant by virtue of size and nature.
In the period to 31 December 2015, 4.8 million of pension settlement costs incurred in rationalising pension schemes, primarily the buying out of the Bilton Group Pension Scheme, were excluded from the calculation of Adjusted profit.
There is no tax effect of this item in the period to 31 December 2015.
No non-EPRA adjustments to underlying profit were made in 2016.

Any potential or proposed changes to the SPPICAV legislation are monitored.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 128 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 7.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of 1,109.1 million 2015: 856.3 million of borrowings was 1,109.6 million 2015: 869.5 million.
This results in a fair value adjustment of 0.5 million 2015: 13.2 million, at share 0.2 million 2015: 6.6 million, see Note 14.
On 18 October 2016 SELP issued a seven year, 500 million unsecured bond at an annual coupon of 1.25 per cent.
This along with a new 200 million revolving credit facility was partly used to repay 406.5 million of existing bank debt, as discussed further in the Financial Review on page 52.
In February 2016, SEGRO entered into an agreement with Roxhill Development Group to develop a portfolio of big box logistics assets in the UK through a series of joint ventures which are at various stages of planning and development.
On 17 June 2015 The Heathrow Big Box Industrial and Distribution Fund Big Box was dissolved with SEGRO acquiring the remaining 50 per cent shareholding in the joint venture.
The retiring joint venture partner acquired full ownership of one of the two assets previously owned by the joint venture.
Upon completion of the acquisition, The Heathrow Big Box Industrial and Distribution Fund was consolidated into SEGROs financial statements.
The acquisition of Big Box resulted in a net cash inflow of 2.6 million as detailed in the cashflow statement representing cash acquired as part of the transaction.

In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring its worldwide property rental business represents more than 75 per cent of total profits and assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to theREIT legislation are monitored and discussed with HMRC.
It is Managements intention that the Group will continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future.
SEGRO is also a SIIC in France, and does not pay tax on its French property income or gains on property sales, provided that at least 95 per cent of the French subsidiaries property income is distributed to their immediate shareholder.
In addition, the Group has to meet certain conditions such as ensuring the property rental business of each French subsidiary represents more than 80 per cent of its assets.
Any potential or proposed changes to the SIIC legislation aremonitored.
It is Managements intention that the Group will continue as a SIIC for the foreseeable future.
The joint venture tax adjustment is required because the profit on ordinary activities before tax includes share of profit from joint ventures after tax, whereas the total tax balance excludes joint ventures.

Further unrecognised tax losses of 799.9 million also exist at 31 December 2016 2015: 766.3 million of which 46.2 million 2015: 36.8 million expires in nine years.
The majority of the unrecognised tax loss balance relates to historic capital losses that arose on property disposals and on losses generated from debt close-out costs.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 132 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 12.
Tax continued For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities or deferred tax assets arising from investment properties that are measured using the fair value model, the Directors have reviewed the Groups investment property portfolios and concluded that the Groups investment properties are not held under a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment properties over time, rather than through sale.
Therefore, in determining the Groups deferred taxation on investment properties, the directors have determined that the presumption that the carrying amounts of investment properties measured using the fair value model are recovered entirely through sale is not rebutted.
As a result, the Group has recognised deferred taxes on changes in fair value of investment properties for all jurisdictions, with the exception of the UK and France, where the Group is not subject to any corporate income taxes onthe fair value changes of the investment properties on disposal.
12 iv Factors that may affect future tax charges No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, nonet UK tax is expected to be payable.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to fall in stages to 17 per cent by 2020.
This is unlikely to significantly impact the Groups taxcharge.

Financial assets also include trade and other receivables excluding prepaid expenses, available-for-sale investments, loan to joint ventures and cash and cash equivalents, which are all classified as other financial assets.
Financial liabilities in the Group comprise interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swap contracts which are categorised as fair value through the Income Statement non-hedge and forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges.
Financial liabilities also include secured and unsecured bank loans and unsecured bond issues which are categorised as debt and initially recognised at fair value less costs and subsequently at amortised cost: and trade and other payables excluding deferred revenue which are classified as other financialliabilities.
The carrying values of these financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value, with the exception of unsecured bond issues.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of 1,491.2 million of unsecured bonds issued was 1,850.9 million 2015: 1,489.0 million compared with 1,778.1 million fair value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates with matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps and currency swap contracts are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and the appropriate exchange rate at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments, such as those classified as available-for-sale investments, are typically valued by the Fund Manager based on the amount at which the asset would be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The methodology used to estimate fair value will depend on the nature and facts and circumstances of the investment but will use one of the following bases: transaction value, earnings multiple, net assets, price of recent investment and sale price, where appropriate a marketability discount will be applied.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Company to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.

Financial instruments and fair values continued Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet The Group and Company financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are available-for-sale investments, forward exchange and currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps as detailed in Note 16 and above.
All of these financial instruments would be classified as level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 13, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
There were no transfers betweencategories in the current or prior year.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing in keeping with our long term mid-cycle LTV target of 40 per cent.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity and Notes 22 to 24.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against medium-term committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in Note19.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk management The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency flows.
However, it does have operations in Continental Europe which transact business denominated mostly in euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into sterling for each financial period and at each Balance Sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing Balance Sheet translation exposure is described in the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section in the Financial Review on page 53.
The Groups Balance Sheet translation exposure including the impact of derivative financial instruments is summarised below: 2016 2015 Euros US Dollars Total Euros US Dollars Total m m m m m m Group Gross currency assets 1,739.6 39.7 1,779.3 1,350.4 33.2 1,383.6 Gross currency liabilities 1,198.2 23.3 1,221.5 1,213.3 19.5 1,232.8 Net exposure 541.4 16.4 557.8 137.1 13.7 150.8 Company Gross currency assets 928.2 38.6 966.8 705.2 31.9 737.1 Gross currency liabilities 1,184.1 61.9 1,246.0 1,190.4 51.4 1,241.8 Net exposure 255.9 23.3 279.2 485.2 19.5 504.7 2016 gross currency liabilities include 299.4 million 255.9 million and USD28.6 million 23.3 million designated as net investment hedges.
2015 gross currency liabilities include 659.9 million 485.2 million and USD28.6 million 19.5 million designated as net investment hedges.
The remaining gross currency liabilities of the Group shown in the table above that are not designated as net investment hedges are either held directly in a euro or US dollar functional currency entity or passed down to such an entity from a sterling functional currency company through inter-company funding arrangements.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups main currency exposure is the euro.
The blended sensitivity of the net assets of the Group to a 10 per cent increase in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies is 50.7 million 2015: 13.7 million, with a sensitivity of 49.2 million against the euro 2015: 12.5 million and 1.5 million against the US dollar 2015: 1.2million.
The 10 per cent sensitivity rate is used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to management and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of net assets after taking account of external loans, currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts at the period end for a 10 per cent change in the value of sterling against the relevant currencies.
For the Company, the blended sensitivity is 25.4 million 2015: 45.9 million with a sensitivity of 23.2 million against the euro 2015: 44.1 million and 2.1 million against the US dollar 2015: 1.8 million.
Financial Statements 141 Overview Strategic Report Governance Forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts Some of the forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts held by the Group are designated as net investment hedges of euro and US dollar denominated subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in reserves and recognised in the Income Statement when the operation is sold.
The remaining foreign exchange and currency swap contracts are effectively economic cash flow hedges, for example using surplus cash in one currency to provide typically through intercompany debt funding arrangements with overseas subsidiaries funds to repay debt, or to fund development expenditure or acquisitions in another currency.
These instruments have not been designated as hedges.
As a consequence exchange movements in respect of these instruments are taken through the Income Statement.
Offsetting these movements are 100.6 million exchange gains 2015: 31.6 million loss arising on intercompany debt funding arrangements discussed above resulting in a loss on exchange differences of 0.3 million 2015: 0.5 million gain within net finance costs in Note 11.
The Groups translation exposure risk management policy is that between 50 and 100 per cent of assets denominated in a foreign currency should be hedged by liabilities in the same currency.
During the year the foreign currency denominated liabilities of the Group were predominantly the currency leg of foreign exchange and currency swap contracts both those designated as net investment hedges and those which are effectively cash flow hedges and the application of this policy is the main economic purpose of these instruments.
Further details are provided within the Foreign Currency Translation Exposure section of the Financial Review on page 53.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that 50 to 100 per cent of net borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Finance Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the Balance Sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates, and any lesser impact is proportionately linear.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 would decrease increase by 2.7 million 2015: decrease increase by 4.9million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the Balance Sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 142 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 20.
Financial instruments and fair values continued Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to manage the interest rate risk of the Groups borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances atthe end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts, based on their contractual maturities, outstanding as at the reporting date: Average contract Notional principal fixedinterest rate amount Fair value 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 % % m m m m Pay fixed, receive floating contracts: Group In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 0.24 0.19 606.9 198.5 10.0 0.9 In more than five years 0.34 0.29 222.2 514.7 4.7 0.2 Total 829.1 713.2 14.7 1.1 Company In one year or less In more than one year but less than two In more than two years but less than five 0.24 0.19 606.9 198.5 10.0 0.9 In more than five years 0.34 0.29 222.2 514.7 4.7 0.2 Total 829.1 713.2 14.7 1.1 Receive fixed, pay floating contracts: Group In one year or less 5.63 250.0 11.1 In more than one year but less than two 3.42 5.95 350.0 350.0 14.9 17.1 In more than two years but less than five 6.44 6.02 509.0 559.0 65.2 57.1 In more than five years 6.75 50.0 6.6 Total 1,109.0 959.0 91.2 80.8 Company In one year or less 5.63 250.0 11.1 In more than one year but less than two 3.42 5.95 350.0 350.0 14.9 17.1 In more than two years but less than five 6.44 6.02 509.0 559.0 65.2 57.1 In more than five years 6.75 50.0 6.6 Total 1,109.0 959.0 91.2 80.8 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them, hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the Income Statement.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a three-month or six-month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR or sterling LIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle or receive the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.

Financial instruments and fair values continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 5 per cent of rental income.
Trade receivables were less than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2016 and at 31 December 2015.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
Inexcess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
Ageing of past due trade but not impaired receivables were as follows: 2016 2015 m m 030 days 1.5 3.5 3060 days 0.9 0.6 6090 days 1.1 0.1 90180 days 0.4 0.6 180 days 0.6 1.3 Past due 4.5 6.1 Not due 18.3 15.2 Total trade receivables 22.8 21.3 No other receivables were considered impaired or overdue.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to banks and short-term liquidity funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by requiring that adequate cash and committed bank facilities are available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend, trade related and corporate cash flows over a rolling 18-month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk management is discussed in more detail in the Financial Position and Funding section in the Financial Review on pages 51 to 52.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity profile for its financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principalcash flows.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 144 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 20.
Retirement benefit schemes Background The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes, the SEGRO Pension Scheme the SEGRO scheme which, in 2015, merged with two other schemes the Brixton plc Pension Plan and the J Saville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme : and the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme.
Defined benefit pension provision is through trust-based schemes.
These arrangements are now closed to new entrants and to future accrual of benefits the SEGRO scheme being closed to future accrual effective from the end of 2016 giving rise to a past service credit of 2.3 million.
In these arrangements, the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards.
The Trustee board of each pension scheme is required by law to act in the best interests of the fund and its members and also takes into consideration the interests of the employers.
There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have member representation, with the other Trustees being company appointed.
During 2015, and after discussion with SEGRO plc, the Trustees of the Bilton scheme committed to a process to buy out the Bilton scheme, which is anticipated to be finalised in 2017.
The Trustees decided to insure members benefits with a third party specialist insurance company: the terms and conditions of the buy-out were agreed on 30 April 2015 subject to true-up following a data cleanse exercise followed by the issuance of individual policies due to be completed in the early part of 2017.
The transaction, which has been predominantly funded from the assets of the scheme, will fide-risk this mature scheme and reduce the administrative burden of managing it.
In 2015 SEGRO incurred a pension settlement costs charge of 4.8 million in rationalising the pension schemes, as detailed in Note 2, primarily the buying out of the Bilton Group Pension Scheme.
The Bilton scheme is net asset neutral with the balance and movements in liabilities matched with insured pension assets provided by a third party specialist and a small amount of cash.
The Trustee Boards are responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the relevant fund, although the Company must be consulted on this and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the funding position is established.
The Company and Trustee boards are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this.
The contributions may need to incorporate deficit recovery contributions if a deficit position is determined through the valuation.
In agreeing contribution rates, reference must be made to the affordability ofcontributions by the employer.
In general, any surplus after benefits have been paid secured, can be repaid to the employer.
Following each actuarial valuation the Company agrees with the Trustees a deficit recovery plan if necessary.
The Company paid deficit contributions of 7.7 million to the SEGRO scheme in this respect 2015: 7.2 million plus a one off lump sum of 10.0 million to the SEGRO scheme following the merger of the SEGRO scheme, the Brixton plc Pension Plan and the J Saville Gordon Group plc and Subsidiary Companies Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme.
The Company considers that, were a pension asset to be realised in respect of this scheme, this would be fully recoverable in line with the rules of the scheme.
The valuation of the SEGRO scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2013 and the draft valuation at 31 March 2016 which is expected to be finalised in the first half of 2017 and updated by the independent actuary in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 December 2016.
Other than market and demographic risks, which are common to all retirement benefit schemes, there are no specific risks in the relevant benefit schemes which the Group considers to be significant or unusual.
Over 70 per cent of the schemes assets are held in a matching portfolio of Pooled Liability Driven Investment LDI Funds and Corporate Bonds which are a broad hedge for the schemes liabilities including some which are index-linked.
It is the intention for the SEGRO scheme to move to less risky assets as the scheme matures to match the liabilities of the scheme.
The schemes assets do not include any financial instruments or property owned by the Group.

The Group also has a number of defined contribution schemes for which 1.2 million has been recognised as an expense 2015: 1.3 million.
Sensitivities The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the SEGRO scheme assets are set out below.
These were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the SEGRO schemes assets.
The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practise, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
The Bilton scheme has been excluded from this sensitivity analysis as it is in the process of being brought out and consequently the Group is not materially exposed to movement in this schemes liabilities.

A percentage of any payment made under the Bonus Scheme is deferred to shares and held in trust for three years.
The percentage subject to deferral for Executive Directors is 50 per cent of the Bonus payment.
The scheme is detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 85 to 97.

22 ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary employee share scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers.
Vesting of awards is subject to four-year performance conditions and is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions of the LTIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report on pages 85 to 97.
Ifa participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the award will lapse, unless the participant is deemed to be entitled to the award, in which case the award will be pro-rated on length of employment in relation to the award date.
The calculation of the award was based on a share price of 420.7 pence, the closing mid-market share price on 6 April 2016.
No consideration was paid for the grant of any award.

UK employees, who have been employed by the Group since 1 October of the preceding year, may be awarded shares in relation to the Companys prior year PBT performance.
In 2016, as the PBT performance target was achieved in full participating employees were each awarded shares to the value of 3,000.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group within three years from the date of award the shares will be forfeited, unless the employee is entitled to the shares due to certain leaver circumstances, in which case the shares will be transferred out of the trust to the participant.
22 iv Global Share Incentive Plan GSIP The GSIP was launched in 2008 as an all-employee share scheme for non-UK based employees.
It is not HMRC approved but the eligibility and performance conditions of the award are designed to replicate the SIP.
Employees are granted awards which are released by the Trustees at conclusion of a three-year holding period.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group during the three-year period then the award will lapse unless the participant is entitled to the award due to the terms of leaving.
Shares in respect of the GSIP are held in the SEGRO plc Employees Benefit Trust.

For 2016, a three-year period was offered to employees and if they remain in employment, employees can purchase shares in the Company at a price which is fixed at the start of the saving period.
The price is usually set at a 20 per cent discount to the then market price.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Group, in certain circumstances the participant may be able to exercise their options within a fixed period from the date of leaving.

Vailog, a privately owned Italian development business, for consideration of 28.0 million including 2.8 million contingent consideration which was paid subsequently in 2015 and related to a pre-let development becoming unconditional and to a tenant not exercising a right to purchase the property that they occupy.
The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and Goodwill of 2.0 million primarily as a result of the difference between the value of the acquired investment properties as assessed by our external values and the consideration paid and transaction costs of 1.6 million arose on acquisitions and were immediately charged to the Income Statement and shown within Goodwill and other amounts written off on acquisitions.

The non-controlling interest arising on the acquisition of Vailog represents the carrying value of the 10 per cent interest not acquired by the Group.
As part of the transaction, the minority shareholder retains an option put option to sell his 10 per cent interest to the Group from three years after the transaction exercisedate.
The gross settlement amount exercise price of the put option has been estimated at 7.0 million.
The exercise price has been calculated using the estimated future cash flows of Vailog.
The exercise price is 10 per cent of the net asset value of Vailog at the exercise date, subject to a floor of 10 per cent of net asset value at the acquisition date.
The non-controlling interest recognised in the Groups Balance Sheet represents the 10 per cent shareholding 4.8 million, net of the estimated gross settlement amount of the put option 7.0 million 6.0 million.
Any subsequent adjustments to the value of the put option will be recognised in the Groups Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
In the period to 31 December 2016, there have been no such adjustments.

Property valuation techniques and related quantitative information All of the Groups properties are level 3, as defined by IFRS 13, in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December 2016 and there were no transfers between levels during the year.
Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties are those which are unobservable, as opposed to level 1 inputs from quoted prices and level 2 observable inputs either directly, i. e. as prices, or indirectly, i. e. derived from prices.
Based on different approaches for different properties, the following valuation techniques can be used for the same class of assets: The yield methodology valuation technique is used when valuing the Groups assets which uses market rental values capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the fair market values per square metre derived from actual market transactions for similar assets.
For properties under construction and the majority of land held for development, properties are valued using a residual method valuation.
Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the investment value using the above mentioned methodology for completed buildings.
Deductions are then made for the total estimated costs to complete, including notional finance costs and developers profit, to take into account the hypothetical purchasers management of the remaining development process and their perception ofrisk with regard to construction and the property market e. g. asregards potential cost overruns and letting risk.
Land values are cross-checked against the rate per hectare derived from actual market transactions.
Other land is also valued on this comparative basis, the ranges for which are per hectare 1.8 million 9.1 million 2015: 1.3 million 5.8 million for the UK and 0.2 million 2.5 million 2015: 0.2 million 2.2 million for Continental Europe.
An increase decrease to ERV will increase decrease valuations, while an increase decrease to yield decreases increases valuations.
An increase in ERV of 5 per cent, in isolation would increase the value of the property portfolio including joint ventures at share by 228.3 million 2015: 206.6 million : whilst a decrease in ERV of 5 per cent would reduce the value by 221.6 million 2015: 198.7 million.
Similarly, a decrease in yield by 25 bps would increase value by 266.2 million 2015: 237.7 million whilst an increase in yield of 25 bps would decrease value by 243.7 million 2015: 218.1 million.
There are interrelationships between all these inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase in more than one input would be to magnify the impact on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions, e. g. an increase in rent may be offset by an increase in yield.
The below table includes wholly-owned and joint-venture assets at share in order to include the entire portfolio, the equivalent analysis for the range of inputs on a wholly-owned basis would not be significantly different.
Combined property portfolio column will not cast down but row does cast across.
3 In relation to the completed properties only.
4 Higher value uses includes offices and retail uses, such as trade counters, car showrooms and self-storage facilities.
5 Included in the completed portfolio, the wholly owned assets are: Big box 1,216.3 million 1,187.4 million : light industrial 2,381.6 million 2015: 1,971.6 million : data centres 314.2 million 2015: 308.7 million : and higher value uses 219.7 million 2015: 491.7 million including offices.
