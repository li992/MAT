5 TAXATION ACCOUNTING POLICY The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is considered probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to the relevant WD[ DXWKRULWLHV DV SURPSWO DV SRVVLEOH DW DQ WLPH WKH URXS KDV HDUV RXWVWDQGLQJ DQG LV LQYROYHG LQ GLVSXWHV DQG WD[ DXGLWV 6LJQLFDQW LVVXHV may take many years to resolve.
In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of the provision whenever necessary.

Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised within other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

Factors affecting future tax charges The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world and is subject to factors that may affect future tax charges including potential US tax reform, implementation of the OECDs BEPS actions, tax rate changes, tax legislation changes and resolution of tax audits and disputes.
At any given time the Group has unagreed years outstanding in various countries and is involved in tax audits and disputes, some of which may take several years to resolve.
The Group believes that it has made adequate provision in respect of additional tax liabilities that may arise from these unagreed years, tax audits and disputes, the majority of which relate to transfer pricing matters as would be expected for a Group operating internationally.
However, the actual liability for any particular issue may be higher or lower than the amount provided resulting in a negative or positive effect on the tax charge in any given year.
In December 2016, the Group appealed to the First-Tier Tribunal in the UK against a decision by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC relating to the tax deductibility of certain historical foreign exchange losses.
The decision of the Tribunal was released on 8 February 2017 and it upheld the Groups appeal.

In the event that HMRC decide not to appeal or if they do and the Group is ultimately successful in the Courts following an appeal, then the Groups tax charge would be reduced, in the year of success, as a result.
In 2016, the UK Government enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK statutory corporation tax to 19.0% from 1 April 2017 and 17.0% from 1 April 2020.

The value-in-use calculations shows that if the assumed long-term growth rates were reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of each CGU would still be greater than its carrying value.
Discount rate management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the value-in-use calculations.
This sensitivity analysis shows that for the recoverable amount of each CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 13.2% for the Reconstruction CGU, 17.2% for the Other Surgical Devices CGU and 21.6% for the Advanced Wound Products CGU.
9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACCOUNTING POLICIES Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights are initially measured at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination referred to as acquisition intangibles is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on its nature.
Internally-generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets.
Software that is integral to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration receivable associated with the sale of product rights and other assets outside of a business combination is recognised at the time of sale to the extent that the future event upon which the contingent consideration is conditional is within the Groups control, or to the extent that is it considered to be virtually certain that the contingent consideration will become due.
If the contingent consideration is outside of the Groups FRQWURO RU LW FDQQRW EH FRQVLGHUHG YLUWXDOO FHUWDLQ WKDW LW ZLOO EHFRPH GXH DQ DVVHW DQG FRUUHVSRQGLQJ HQWU LQ SURW DQG ORVV LV UHFRJQLVHG RQO RQFH it becomes virtually certain that the contingent consideration will become due.
Contingent consideration payable associated with the purchase of product rights and other assets outside of a business combination is recognised at the time of sale to the extent that the future event upon which the contingent consideration is conditional is under the control of the seller and it is considered probable that the contingent consideration will become due.
Contingent consideration associated within a contingent condition that is within the Groups control is recognised at the point when the contingent condition is met.
Impairment of intangible assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which it belongs.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.

They are recorded as inventory until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between three and seven years.
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use referred to as consignment inventory.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage.

The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims.
Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements of such claims, and all claims have now been resolved.
The aggregate cost at 31 December 2016 related to this matter is approximately $205m.
The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims.
The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability.
However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters.
In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee, for which a trial has not yet begun.
An additional $22m was received during 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
17.3 Legal proceedings Product liability claims The Group faces claims from time to time for alleged defects in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products from the market.
Such claims are endemic to the medical device industry.
The Group maintains product liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles that management believes are reasonable.
All policies contain exclusions and limitations, however, and there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all claims.
In recent years, there has been heightened concern about possible adverse effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, and the Group has incurred, and will continue to incur expenses to defend claims in this area.
As of February 2017, and giving effect to the US settlements described below, approximately 770 such claims were pending with the Group around the world, of which approximately 320 had given rise to pending OHJDO SURFHHGLQJV 0RVW FODLPV UHODWH WR WKH URXSV %LUPLQJKDP LS 5HVXUIDFLQJ % 5 SURGXFW DQG LWV WZR PRGXODU PHWDO RQ PHWDO FRPSRQHQWV WKH %LUPLQJKDP LS 0RGXODU HDG % 0 DQG WKH RSWLRQDO PHWDO OLQHU FRPSRQHQW RI WKH 5 $FHWDEXODU 6 VWHP 5 0 7KH % 0 DQG 5 0 DUH QR ORQJHU on the market: the R3ML was withdrawn in 2012 and the BHMH was phased out in 2014.
In 2015, the Group ceased offering smaller sizes of the BHR and restricted instructions for BHR use in female patients.
These actions were taken to ensure that the BHR is only used in those patient groups where it continues to demonstrate strong performance.
In 2015 and 2016, the Groups US subsidiary settled the majority of its US metal-on-metal hip lawsuits in two group settlements, without admitting liability.
Insurance receipts covered most of the amounts paid, with the net cash cost being $25m.
These cases had been consolidated in a state court in Memphis, Tennessee and principally related to the Groups modular metal-on-metal hip components, which are no longer on the market.
In February 2017, certain plaintiffs asked the US Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer 31 cases pending in federal courts to the US District Court for the District of Maryland.
In England and Wales, metal-on-metal hip implant claims against various companies have been consolidated for trials under group litigation orders in the High Court in London.
The BHR and other claims pending against the Group have been stayed and will not be reactivated until the outcome of those trials is known.
The Group has requested indemnity from its product liability insurers for most of these metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
Each insurer makes its own decision as to coverage issues, and the liability of some insurers depends on exhaustion of lower levels of coverage.
The Group is working with all of the insurers to address any defences to coverage they have raised.
