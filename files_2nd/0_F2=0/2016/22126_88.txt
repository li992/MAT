138 Capita plc Strategic report Governance A Acco ccou un nt ts s NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17 Business combinations 2016 acquisitions The Group made a number of acquisitions in 2016 which are shown in aggregate.
The fair values of the identiable assets and liabilities acquired are disclosed in the table below: Fair value to Group recognised on acquisition m Property, plant and equipment 2.7 Intangible assets 50.7 Trade and other receivables due in less than one year 41.4 Corporation tax 3.1 Cash and cash equivalents 4.0 Trade and other payables excluding accruals due in less than one year 21.2 Accruals due in less than one year 31.7 Provisions 1.0 Deferred tax 8.3 Finance leases 0.8 Net assets 32.7 Goodwill arising on acquisition 69.6 102.3 Discharged by: Cash 93.5 Contingent consideration accrued 8.8 102.3 In all cases, 100% of the ordinary share capital was acquired.
The companies acquired have been mainly in the areas of IT, and Digital and Software solutions which complement or extend the Groups existing skill sets and provide opportunities for growth into these markets.
In addition, during the year the Group settled 10.7m of deferred consideration and 18.5m of contingent consideration payments with regard to previous acquisitions, all of which had been accrued.
Where this can be determined, the acquired subsidiaries contributed 1.61 m to the profit before tax of the Group.
If these acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2016, Group revenue would have been an estimated 4,989.9m and Group profit before tax would have been an estimated 72.0m.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2016.
During the year, some of the acquired businesses have been completely integrated into the existing business of the Group and therefore their post-acquisition performance cannot be determined.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisitions because the fair value of the acquired assets was lower than the consideration paid: the goodwill represents the value to the Group that can be driven from these underlying assets over the life of the acquired businesses, particularly from synergies, and the capabilities of the acquired workforce.
The total amount of goodwill recognised in the period that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes is nil 2015: 44.4m.
The fair value exercise has been completed on a provisional basis for acquisitions made in 2016.
The Group will complete this review in 2017 though any adjustment to the carrying value is likely to be insignicant to the individual acquisition.
In total, the effect of revisions made to fair value adjustments in the current year that had been determined provisionally at the immediately preceding balance sheet date increases goodwill by 1.7m.
Contingent consideration In respect of the acquisitions made in 2016, the Group has agreed to pay the vendors additional consideration dependent on the achievement of performance targets in the periods post acquisition.
These performance periods are of up to 4 years in duration and will be settled in cash and loan notes on their payment date on achieving the relevant targets.
The range of the additional consideration payment is estimated to be between 1m and 23m.
The Group has included 8.8m as contingent consideration related to the additional consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration has been calculated based on the Groups expectation of what it will pay in relation to the postacquisition performance of the acquired entities by weighting the probability of a range of payments to give an estimate of the final obligation.
Acquisition related costs The Group incurred acquisition related costs of 9.0m related to professional fees paid for due diligence, general professional fees and legal related costs.
These costs have been included in non-underlying administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated income statement.
