Calculation of these provisions requires sold, which management can estimate reliably based upon the length judgements to be made which include forecast consumer demand, the of the policies and the historical rate of customer attrition.
Reliance on promotional, competitive and economic environment and inventory historical data assumes that current and future experience will follow loss trends.

Financial instruments continued b Credit risk Financial risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of these assets.
The Groups receivable balance primarily comprises accrued income representing the expected future commission payments in relation to the product protection plans sold by the Group on behalf of one customer.
The Directors have assessed and considered the credit risk in respect of this amount and do not consider it to be of significance.
The Groups trade receivable balances comprise a number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, operating within the same industry but over a number of geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited.
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.
It is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.
Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.
Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk at the statement of financial position date by class of financial instrument was: 2016 2015 m m Accrued income 39.4 26.1 Trade receivables 9.7 8.0 49.1 34.1 Credit quality of financial assets and impairment losses The ageing of trade receivables at the statement of financial position date was: Gross Net m m Not past due 9.0 9.0 Past due 0-30 days 0.6 0.6 Past due 31-120 days More than 120 days 0.1 0.1 At 31 March 2016 9.7 9.7 Not past due 5.7 5.7 Past due 0-30 days 1.8 1.8 Past due 31-120 days 0.3 0.3 More than 120 days 0.2 0.2 At 31 March 2015 8.0 8.0 There has been no impairment charged to trade receivables in the current year.
c Liquidity risk Financial risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short-term and long-term financial requirements.
In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Uncommitted facilities are used if available on advantageous terms.
It is Group treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Groups borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other functional currencies within the Group.
