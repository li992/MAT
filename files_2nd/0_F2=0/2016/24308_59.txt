NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 24 Post-employment obligations 2016 2015 Post-employment obligations as at the year end comprise: m m Pensions funded 1,285 977 unfunded 662 505 Medical funded 37 30 unfunded 49 46 2,033 1,558 The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In addition, in the US and UK various plans operate which provide members with post-retirement medical benefits.
The Groups post-employment plans in the UK, US and Germany together account for 98% of plan assets and 98% of plan liabilities.
The Groups post-employment plans include both funded and unfunded arrangements.
The UK pension schemes are funded, albeit in deficit in common with many other UK pension schemes, with the scheme assets held in trustee-administered funds.
The German and other European plans are generally unfunded, with pension payments made from company funds as they fall due, rather than from scheme assets.
The US schemes include a combination of funded and unfunded pension and medical plans, while Japan also operates a funded pension plan.
The Groups defined benefit pension arrangements provide benefits to members in the form of an assured level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided typically depends on length of service and salary levels in the years leading up to retirement.
In the UK and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with inflation, whereas in the US pensions generally do not receive inflationary increases once in payment.
The UK and German schemes are closed to new entrants, while the US schemes are closed to future accrual.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2016.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service cost elements were measured using the projected unit credit method.
a Defined benefit schemes assumptions and estimates Estimating the post-employment obligation involves a number of significant assumptions, which are detailed below.
Key assumptions and estimates: UK GKN1 GKN2 GKN3 Americas Europe ROW % % % % % % 2016 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past future service n a 4.30 4.25 n a n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions n a 3.20 3.30 n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past future service n a 2.60 2.70 2.45 4.10 1.60 0.50 Inflation assumption past future service n a 3.30 3.25 3.35 n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long-term 5.4 5.4 6.75 5.0 n a n a 2015 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries past future service n a 4.10 4.15 n a n a 2.50 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.05 3.10 n a n a 1.75 n a Discount rate past future service 3.55 3.85 4.05 n a 4.30 2.40 0.80 Inflation assumption past future service 3.05 3.10 3.15 n a n a 1.75 n a Rate of increase in medical costs: Initial long-term 5.4 5.4 7.0 5.0 n a n a The assumptions table above specifies separate assumptions for past and future service in relation to the UK pension scheme.
This approach is consistent with that taken in 2015, whereby a different, future service set of assumptions will be used to determine the service cost for the following year.
This reflects market practice and is based on the premise that active members of the scheme are younger and have, on average, longer remaining life expectancy than an average scheme member.
Given that yield curves typically rise over time, this longer duration implies a higher discount rate for the active sub-set of members which has been set at 2.70%, as at 31 December 2016.
160 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION The GKN1 scheme is in the process of being wound up which commenced in December 2016.
The residual liabilities have been transferred to the new GKN3 scheme.
The UK schemes each use a duration-specific discount rate derived from the Mercer pension discount yield curve, which is based on corporate bonds with two or more AA-ratings.
The European discount rate was calculated with reference to Aon Hewitts German discount rate yield curve.
For the US, the discount rate referenced the Citigroup intermediate pension liability index, the Merrill Lynch US corporate AA 10 years index and the Towers Watson Rate:LINK benchmark.
The approach taken in each territory is consistent with the prior year.
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes, are as follows: UK The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN2 and GKN3 use S2PA year of birth mortality tables adjusted for GKN experience with CMI 2015 improvements and a 1.5% per annum long-term improvement trend.
These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN3 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.4 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.0 years, while a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 24.5 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 27.4 years from age 65.
For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 22.5 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 25.6 years, while a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 24.9 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 28.0 years from age 65.
Overseas In the US, RP-2014 tables have been used, while in Germany the RT2005-G tables have been used.
In the US, the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 20.8 years female 22.8 years, while in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 19.1 years female 23.2 years.
The longevity assumption for a US male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 22.4 years once attaining 65 years female 24.4 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.8 years female 25.7 years.
These assumptions are based on the prescribed tables, rather than GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions longevity: 1 year on the defined benefit obligations as at 31 December 2016 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities m m m m Discount rate 1% 535 41 104 3 Discount rate -1% 709 50 136 2 Rate of inflation 1% 556 1 89 Rate of inflation -1% 463 74 Life expectancy 1 year 126 9 26 Life expectancy -1 year 126 10 23 Health cost trend 1% 2 2 Health cost trend -1% 2 2 The above sensitivity analyses are based on isolated changes in each assumption, while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and there is likely to be some level of correlation between movements in different assumptions.
In addition, these sensitivities relate only to potential movement in the defined benefit obligations.
The assets, including derivatives held by the schemes, have been designed to mitigate the impact of these movements to some extent, such that the movements in the defined benefit obligations shown above would, in practice, be partly offset by movements in asset valuations.
However, the above sensitivities are shown to illustrate at a high level the scale of sensitivity of the defined benefit obligations to key actuarial assumptions.
The same actuarial methods have been used to calculate these sensitivities as are used to calculate the relevant balance sheet values, and have not changed compared to the previous period.
Pension partnership interest During the year, the Group has paid 30 million 2015: 30 million to the UK pension schemes through its pension partnership arrangement and this is included within the amount of contributions benefits paid.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 161 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 24 Post-employment obligations continued a Defined benefit schemes assumptions and estimates continued Pensioner buy-out In December 2016, the Company commenced the winding-up of the GKN Group Pension Scheme GKN1.
The benefits were settled through a combination of: a buy-out secured with Pension Insurance Corporation for a premium of 190 million: paying Winding-Up Lump Sums and trivial commutations to members with small-value benefits: and transfer of liabilities to a new GKN Group Pension Scheme 2016 GKN3.
This transaction involved a specific contribution of 15 million from the Company to Scheme and resulted in the removal of 268 million of liabilities and 263 million of assets from the balance sheet.
This has resulted in an overall settlement gain of 5 million net of expenses in the income statement.

Once the valuation process is complete, the funding deficit in each scheme will be confirmed and any incremental deficit contributions payable by the Group will be established.
It is likely that some additional Group funding will be required, but given the stage of negotiations with the scheme trustees and the many variables involved in both establishing the valuation and agreeing any resulting recovery plan, the final outcome cannot currently be predicted with any reasonable degree of certainty.
Following the previous triennial valuation in the UK, additional deficit funding payments of 10 million per year have continued and there is potential for further payments commencing in 2017, contingent upon asset performance.
In addition, the Group agreed, during 2014, to pay 2 million per year for four years to the UK scheme, GKN1, to cover a funding requirement arising from a 123 million bulk annuity purchase and this payment will continue in 2017 to GKN3.
The combined contribution for deficit funding and future accrual expected to be paid by the Group during 2017 to the UK schemes is 43 million.
In addition, a distribution of 30 million is expected to be made from the UK pension partnership to the UK schemes in the first half of 2017, which brings the total expected UK cash requirement for 2017 to 79 million.
The expected 2017 contribution to overseas schemes is 30 million.

c Defined benefit scheme risk factors Through its various post-employment pension and medical plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The Groups focus is on managing the cash demands which the various pension plans place on the Group, rather than balance sheet volatility in its own right.
For funded schemes, cash requirements are generally determined by funding valuations which are performed on a different basis from accounting valuations.
Asset volatility: plan liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields although the discount rate methodology differs for accounting and funding purposes.
If plan assets deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate, this will create or increase a plan deficit.
GKNs various pension plans hold a significant proportion of equities and similar growth assets, which are expected to out-perform bonds in the long term, albeit at the risk of short-term volatility.
