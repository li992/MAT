FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies Significant accounting policies Marshalls plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 15 March 2017.
The following paragraphs summarise the significant accounting policies of the Group, which have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the EU and therefore the Group Financial Statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and International Financial Reporting Committee relevant to its operations and which are effective in respect of these Financial Statements.
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2016.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these Financial Statements.
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative.
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative for the first time in the current year.
The amendments clarify that an entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material, and give guidance on the bases of aggregating and disaggregating information for disclosure purposes.
However, the amendments reiterate that an entity should consider providing additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users of financial statements to understand the impact of particular transactions, events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance.
In addition, the amendments clarify that an entitys share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted forusing the equity method should be presented separately from those arising from the Group, and should be separated into the share of items that, in accordance with other IFRSs: i will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: and ii will be reclassified subsequently toprofit or loss when specific conditions are met.
The amendments also address the structure of the financial statements by providing examples of systematic ordering or grouping of the notes.
The adoption of these amendments has not resulted in any impact on the financial performance or financial position of the Group.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation.
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation for the first time in the current year.
The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment.
The amendments to IAS 38 introduce a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortisation ofanintangible asset.
This presumption can only be rebutted in the following two limited circumstances: a when the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue: or b when it can be demonstrated that revenue and consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
Other than in relation to queries, where a rate of extraction basis for depreciation is applied the Group uses the straight line method for depreciation and amortisation for all other items if property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
Consequently, theadoption of these amendments has had no impact on the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle.
The Group has adopted the amendments to IFRSs included in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle for the first time in the current year.
The amendments to IFRS 5 introduce specific guidance in IFRS 5 for when an entity reclassifies an asset or disposal group from held for sale to held for distribution to owners or vice versa.
The amendments clarify that such a change should be considered as a continuation of the original plan of disposal and hence requirements set out in IFRS 5 regarding the change of sale plan do not apply.
The amendments also clarify the guidance for when  accounting is discontinued.
The amendments to IFRS 7 provide additional guidance to clarify whether a servicing contract is continuing involvement in a transferred asset for the purpose of the disclosures required in relation to transferred assets.
The amendments to IAS 19 clarify that the rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations should be determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds.
The assessment of the depth of a market for high qualify corporate bonds should be at the currency level i. e. the same currency as the benefits are to be paid.
For currencies for which thereis no deep market in such high quality corporate bonds, the market yields at the end of the reporting period on Government bonds denominated in that currency should be used instead.
The adoption of these amendments has had no effect on the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements.
84 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and, in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions: IAS 7 amendments Disclosure Initiative: and IAS 12 amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group in future periods, except as noted below: IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments: IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material to have a material impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures: and IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the reported assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flows of the Group.
Furthermore, extensive disclosures will be required by IFRS 16.
The Group has disclosed operating lease commitments at 31 December 2016 amounting to 71.0 million 2015: 74.0 million and full disclosures of these are included in Note 23 on page 117.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
a Statement of compliance The Group Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The Parent Company has elected to prepare its Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 101 and these are presented on pages 119 to 126. b Basis of preparation The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also set out in the Strategic Report.
In addition, Note 17 includes the Groups policies and procedures for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Details of the Groups funding position are set out in Note 17 and are subject to normal covenant arrangements.
The Groups on-demand overdraft facility is reviewed on an annual basis and the current arrangements were renewed and signed on 16 August 2016.
In the opinion of the Directors there are sufficient unutilised facilities held which mature after 12 months.
The Groups performance is dependent on economic and market conditions, the outlook for which is difficult to predict.
Based on current expectations, the Groups cash forecasts continue to meet half-year and year-end bank covenants and there is adequate headroom which is not dependent on facility renewals.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these Consolidated Financial Statements and are also set out on the Companys website www.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
Sterling is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
These are set out in Note 26 on page 118.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 85 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of preparation continued Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have a significant effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 26. c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries which are set out in detail in Note 30 on pages 123 and 124 are entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved when the Company: has power over the investee: is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 1 or more of the 3 elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.
The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Companys voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including: the size of the Companys holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders: potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties: rights arising from other contractual arrangements: and any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control ofthe subsidiary.
Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
ii Associates equity-accounted investees Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method equity-accounted investees and are recognised initially at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses and equity movements of equity-accounted investees, after adjustment to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest including any long-term investments is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated inpreparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
iv Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets are initially measured at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at the initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
86 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued d Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
For the purposes of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
e Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, fuel pricing and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value and transaction costs are recognised in the Income Statement when incurred.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see accounting policy f. f Hedging i Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
When the forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding policy statement, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity andrecognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects theincome or expense.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship, but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, it no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting.
The cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
ii Economic hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge economically the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see overleaf and impairment losses seeaccountingpolicy m. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportionofdirectly attributable production overheads.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition toadopted IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plantand equipment.
ii Leased assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Property, plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see overleaf and impairment losses see accounting policy m. iii Subsequent costs The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued g Property, plant and equipment continued iv Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation on quarries is based on estimated rates of extraction.
This is based on a comparison between the volume of relevant material extracted in any given period and the volume of relevant material available for extraction.
Depreciation on leased assets is charged over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic life.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The rates are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent per annum Short leasehold property over the period of the lease Fixed plant and equipment 3.3 per cent to 25 per cent per annum Mobile plant and vehicles 14 per cent to 30 per cent per annum Quarries based on rates of extraction The residual values, useful economic lives and depreciation methods are reassessed annually.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use.
Site preparation costs associated with the development of new stone reserves are capitalised.
These costs would include: costs of clearing the site including internal and outsourced labour in relation to site workers : professional fees including fees relating to obtaining planning consent : purchase, installation and assembly of any necessary extraction equipment: and costs of testing whether the extraction process is functioning properly net of any sales of test products.
Depreciation commences when commercial extraction commences and is based on the rate of extraction.
In accordance with IAS 37, provision is made for quarry restoration where a legal or constructive obligation exists, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will occur and the financial cost of restoration work can be reliably measured.
The lives of quarries are almost always long and it is difficult to estimate the length with any precision.
The majority of quarry restoration work is undertaken while extracting minerals from new areas backfilling and therefore work can be completed without additional cost.
As a result of the particular characteristics of the Groups quarries, the IAS 37 criteria have not been met to date based on the assets so far acquired and, therefore, no provisions have been recognised.
h Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control istransferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2004, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Costs relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, itis not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
On a  basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests either at their fair value or at their proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2016 were not adjusted in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2016.
88 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued h Intangible assets continued i Goodwill continued In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under the Groups previous accounting framework.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 were not adjusted in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy m. In respect of equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included inthe carrying amount of the investment in the investee.
In respect of acquisitions where there is a contingent consideration element, an accrual is created for the estimated amount payable if it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and this can be measured reliably.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process meets the recognition criteria for development expenditure as set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The expenditure capitalised includes all directly attributable costs, from the date which the intangible asset meets the recognition criteria, necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy m. iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy m. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
iv Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied inthespecific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
v Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The rates applied are as follows: Customer and supplier relationships 5 to 20 years Patents, trademarks and know-how 2 to 20 years Development costs 10 to 20 years Software 5 to 10 years i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material less impairment losses see accounting policy m. j Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course ofbusiness, less the estimated costs to completion and of selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity, which were incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
k Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
l Assets classified as held for sale Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within 1 year from the date of classification, and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued m Impairment i Impairment review The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories see accounting policy j and deferred tax assets see accounting policy w, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount isestimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the group of assets identified on acquisition that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The recoverable amount of assets or cash generating units is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairments An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have beendetermined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
n Share capital i Share capital Share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or if it is redeemable but only at the Companys option.
Dividends on share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
Non-equity share capital is classified as aliability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders or if dividend payments are not discretionary.
Dividends thereon are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a financial expense.
ii Dividends Dividends on non-equity shares are recognised as a liability and accounted for on an accruals basis.
Equity dividends are recognised asaliability in the period in which they are declared appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
o Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised intheConsolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
p Pension schemes i Defined benefit schemes The net obligation in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
If the calculation results in a surplus, the resulting asset is measured at the present value of any economic benefits available in the form ofrefunds from the plan, or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The present value of these economic benefits is discounted byreference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
When the benefits of the scheme are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised asanexpense in the Income Statement in the period of the scheme amendment.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of a plan are recognised immediately within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
ii Defined contribution schemes Obligations for contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
90 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued q Share-based payment transactions The Group enters into equity settled share-based payment transactions with its employees.
In particular, annual awards are made to employees under the Companys Management Incentive Plan MIP and there are also outstanding awards from previous years under the2005 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured atgrant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Where appropriate, thefair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Current tax relief is available as shares vest based on the value at the date of vesting.
A deferred tax asset is recognised at grant date based on the number of shares expected to be issued, at the value at which they are expected to be issued, proportioned in line with the vesting period.
r Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Group Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
s Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
t Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at nominal amount discounted if material.
u Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement upon the despatch of goods, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue represents the invoiced value of sales to customers less returns, allowances, rebates and value added tax.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or the possible return of goods orcontinuing management involvement with the goods.
v Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the lease.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii Financial expenses Net financial expenses comprise interest on obligations under the defined benefit pension scheme, the expected return on scheme assets under the defined benefit pension scheme, interest payable on borrowings including finance leases calculated using the effective interest rate method, dividends on non-equity shares, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement see accounting policy f. Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Significant accounting policies continued w Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred taxation.
Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive or in equity, in which case it is .
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred taxation provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary difference reverses, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred taxation assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
x Segment reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of discrete financial information about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
As far as Marshalls is concerned the CODM is regarded as being the Executive Directors.
The Directors have concluded that the Groups Landscape Products business is a single reportable segment, which includes the UK operations of the Marshalls Landscape Products hard landscaping business, servicing both the UK Domestic and the Public Sector and Commercial end markets.
Financial information for Landscape Products is now reported to the Groups CODM for the assessment of segment performance and to facilitate resource allocation.

The Landscape Products reportable segment operates a national manufacturing plan that is structured around a series of production units throughout the UK, in conjunction with a single logistics and distribution operation.
A national planning process supports sales to both of the key end markets, namely the UK Domestic and Public Sector and Commercial end markets and the operating assets produce and deliver a range of broadly similar products that are sold into each of these end markets.
Within the Landscape Products operating segment the focus ison the 1 integrated production, logistics and distribution network supporting both end markets.
Included in Other are the Groups Street Furniture, Mineral Products, Stone Cladding and International operations, which do not currently meet the IFRS 8 reporting requirements.
The accounting policies of the Landscape Products operating segment are the same as the Groups accounting policies.
Segment profit represents the profit earned without allocation of the share of profit of associates and certain central administration costs that are not capable of allocation.
Centrally administered overhead costs that relate directly to the reportable segment are included within the segments results.

The majority of the Groups profits are earned in the UK with the standard rate of corporation tax being 20 per cent for the year to 31 December 2016.
Capital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on fixed assets.
The rates are determined by Parliament annually, and spread the tax relief due over a number of years.
This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the expenditure on fixed assets is treated as an investment with the cost then being spread over the anticipated useful life of the asset, and or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.
The different accounting treatment of fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes is one reason why the taxable income of the Group is not the same as its accounting profit.
During the year to 31 December 2016 the depreciation charge for the year exceeded the capital allowances due to the Group.
Short-term timing differences arise on items such as depreciation in stock and share-based payments because the treatment of such items isdifferent for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences usually reverse in the years following those in which they arise, as is reflected inthe deferred tax charge in the Financial Statements.
Adjustments to tax charges arising in earlier years arise because the tax charge to be included in a set of accounts has to be estimated before those financial statements are finalised.
Such charges therefore include some estimates that are checked and refined before the Groups corporation tax returns for the year are submitted to HM Revenue & Customs, which may reflect a different liability as a result.
Some expenses incurred may be entirely appropriate charges for inclusion in the Financial Statements but are not allowed as a deduction against taxable income when calculating the Groups tax liability for the same accounting period.
Examples of such disallowable expenditure include business entertainment costs and some legal expenses.
As can be seen from the tax reconciliation, the process of adjustment that can give rise to current year adjustments to tax charges arising in previous periods can also give rise to revisions in prior year deferred tax estimates.
This is why the current year adjustments to the current year charge for capital allowances and short-term timing differences are not exactly replicated in the deferred taxation charge for the year.
The Groups overseas operations comprise a manufacturing operation in Belgium and sales and administration offices in the USA, China and Dubai.
The sales of these units, in total, were less than 5 per cent of the Groups turnover in the year to 31 December 2016.
In total, the trading profits were not material and no tax was due.

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units CGUs and these CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill ismonitored for management purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 10 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations and at both 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 the full amount of goodwill in the Group Balance Sheet related to the Landscape Products CGU.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on a combination of individual financial 5-year forecasts, containing assumptions for revenue growth and operational gearing, and appropriate long-term growth rates of 2.5 per cent.
To prepare value-in-use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are discounted back to presentvalue using an appropriate market-based discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 9.5 per cent 2015:10.0per cent.
The Directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and do not consider that any reasonable change inthe assumptions would give rise to the need for further impairment.
Included in software additions is 819,000 2015: 739,000 of own work capitalised.

The Group primarily finances its operations using share capital, retained profits and borrowings.
The Groups bank loans are non-equity funding instruments, further details of which are set out on page 106.
As directed by the Board, the Group does not engage in speculative activities using derivative financial instruments.
Group cash reserves are held centrally to take advantage of the most rewarding short-term investment opportunities.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used inthe management of currency risk.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and pricing risk.
The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks and they have remained unchanged since 2015.
Capital management The Group defines the capital that it manages as its total equity and net debt balances.
The Group manages its capital structure in light of current economic conditions and its strategic objectives to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balances.
The Group manages its medium-term bank debt to ensure continuity of funding and the policy is to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed facilities.
A key objective is to ensure compliance with the covenants set out in the Groups bank facility agreements.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily theshares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups incentive schemes.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
There has been no change in the objectives, policies or processes with regard to capital management during the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
102 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 Financial instruments continued Financial risks The Group has exposure to a number of financial risks through the conduct of its operations.
Risk management is governed by the Groups operational policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures, which are outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 20 to 24.
The key financial risks resulting from financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk and pricing risk.
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Overthelonger term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For instance, a weakening of Pound Sterling on the foreign currency market would increase the cost of certain raw materials, whereas a strengthening would have the opposite effect.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due and does so by monitoring cash flow forecasts and budgets.
Cash resources are largely and normally generated through operations and short-term flexibility is achieved by bank facilities.
Bank debt is raised centrally and the Group aims to maintain a balance between flexibility and continuity of funding by having a range of maturities on its borrowings.
Details of the Group borrowing facilities are provided on page 106. b Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to review regularly the terms of its available short-term borrowing facilities and to assess individually and manage each long-term borrowing commitment accordingly.
The Group borrows principally at floating rates of interest and, where appropriate, uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile, thereby managing the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Approximately 60 to 70 per cent of core debt is covered by interest rate swaps of varying maturities up until 2018, which reflects the maturity date of the related loans and medium-term requirements, in accordance with Group policy.
The Group classifies its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is a 49,000 liability 2015: 77,000 liability and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an ongoing basis.
The period that the swaps cover is matched against the debt maturity in order to fix the impact on the Income Statement.
During the year nil 2015: 144,000 has been recognised in other comprehensive income for the year with 75,000 2015: 109,000 being reclassified from equity to the Income Statement.
The interest rate swaps have been fully effective in the period.
With the addition of the fuel hedges Note 17 e and forward contracts this gives a total of 1,123,000 2015: 940,000 recognised in other comprehensive income for the year with 1,681,000 2015: 1,984,000 being reclassified from equity to the Income Statement.
Sensitivity analysis A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have decreased equity and profit by the amounts shown below.
The sensitivity analysis has been undertaken before the effect of tax.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates andthe fixed rate element of interest rate swaps.
The analysis was performed on the same basis for 2015.
2016 2015 000 000 Increase of 100 basis points 185 349 Decrease of 100 basis points 185 349 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 17 Financial instruments continued Financial risks continued c Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed onall customers requiring credit over a certain amount and, where appropriate, credit insurance cover is obtained.
This provides excellent intelligence to minimise the number and value of bad debts and ultimately provides compensation if bad debts are incurred.
An ageing oftrade receivables is shown in Note 13 on page 101.
Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating equal to or better than the Group.
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement as wellas sound credit ratings.
Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by thecarrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
d Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily Euros and US Dollars.
The Groups policy is to cover all significant foreign currency commitments in respect of trade receivables and trade payables by using forwardforeign currency contracts.
All the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than 1 year after the balance sheet date.
Wherenecessary, the forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is 30,000 asset 2015: 19,000 liability and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an ongoing basis.
At 31 December 2016 alloutstanding forward exchange contracts had a maturity date within 6 months.

The current hedges held are in place until 31 December 2017.
The Group classifies its fuel hedges as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of the fuel hedges is 676,000 asset 2015: 2,053,000 liability and is adjusted against the hedging reserve on an ongoing basis.
The period that the fuel hedges cover is matched against future expected purchases in order to fix the impact on the Income Statement.
During the year 1,123,000 2015: 796,000 has been recognised in other comprehensive income, with 1,606,000 2015: 1,875,000 being reclassified from equity to the Income Statement.

There are additional seasonal bank working capital facilities of 10.0 million available between 1 February and 31August each year.
The undrawn facilities available at 31 December 2016, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were asfollows: 2016 2015 000 000 Committed: Expiring in more than 2 years but not more than 5 years 65,025 43,875 Expiring in 1 year or less Uncommitted: Expiring in 1 year or less 15,000 15,000 80,025 58,875 On 16 August 2016, the Group renewed its short-term working capital facilities and reduced its seasonal working capital facility to 10.0 million.
The Group also extended the maturity of each of its committed facilities by 12 months.
The committed facilities are all revolving credit facilities with interest charged at variable rates based on LIBOR.
The Groups bank facilities continue to be aligned with the current strategy to ensure that headroom against available facilities remains at appropriate levels.
The maturity profile of borrowing facilities is structured to provide balanced, committed and phased medium-term debt.
The current facilities are set out as follows: Cumulative Facility facility 000 000 Committed facilities: Q3: 2021 20,000 20,000 Q3: 2020 20,000 40,000 Q3: 2019 20,000 60,000 Q3: 2018 20,000 80,000 On-demand facilities: Available all year 15,000 95,000 Seasonal February to August inclusive 10,000 105,000 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities A comparison by category of the book values and fair values of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2016 is shown below: 2016 2015 Book amount Fair value Book amount Fair value 000 000 000 000 Trade and other receivables 46,033 46,033 40,690 40,690 Cash and cash equivalents 20,681 20,681 24,990 24,990 Bank loans 14,975 14,192 36,125 34,906 Finance lease liabilities 293 320 327 360 Trade and other payables 70,939 70,939 71,293 71,293 Interest rate swaps, forward contracts and fuel hedges 657 657 2,149 2,149 Financial instrument assets and liabilities net 18,836 44,214 Non-financial instrument assets and liabilities net 235,957 236,932 217,121 192,718 106 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 Financial instruments continued Borrowing facilities continued Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.
a Derivatives Derivative contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price at the relevant rate and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps, broker quotes are used.
b Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
c Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
d Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than 1 year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
e Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments, measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation techniques used todetermine fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices orindirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The Scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustee Board is appointed by both the Company and the Schemes membership and acts in the interest of the Scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustee is also responsible for the investment of the Schemes assets.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme, which closed to future service accrual on 30 June 2006, provides pension and lump sums to members on retirement and to dependants on death.
Members of the defined benefit section became entitled to a deferred pension on closure.
Members no longer pay contributions to the defined benefit section.
Company contributions to the defined benefit section after thisdate are used to fund any deficit in the Scheme and the expenses associated with administering the Scheme, as determined by regular actuarial valuations.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme poses a number of risks to the Company, for example longevity risk, investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and salary risk.
The Trustee is aware of these risks and uses various techniques to control them.
The Trustee has a number of internal control policies, including a risk register, which are in place to manage and monitor the various risks it faces.
The Trustees investment strategy incorporates the use of liability-driven investments LDIs to minimise sensitivity of the actuarial funding position to movements ininterest rates and inflation rates.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 107 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 18 Employee benefits continued The defined benefit section of the Scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every 3 years.
The next actuarial valuation is expected to be carried out with an effective date of 5 April 2018.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
A formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2015.
The results of that valuation have been projected to 31 December 2016 by aqualified independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the projected unit method.
During 2015 an exercise was carried out offering eligible defined benefit section members and current pensioners and dependants the option to commute small pensions for a cash lump sum representing the value of their benefits.
This represents a settlement of benefits for members taking the option.
The cash lump sums were determined by the Trustee on a best estimate basis after taking advice from the actuary.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 000 000 000 Present value of Scheme liabilities 355,793 298,812 309,067 Fair value of Scheme assets 360,069 302,239 312,516 Net amount recognised at year end before any adjustments for deferred tax 4,276 3,427 3,449 The current and past service costs, settlements and curtailments, together with the net interest expense for the year, are included in the employee benefits expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The valuation of the insured pensions has been taken as the value of the corresponding liabilities assessed using the assumptions set out above.
The Scheme has no investments in the Company or in property occupied by the Company.
The Company expects to pay no contributions to the defined benefit section of the Scheme during the year ended 31 December 2017.
Sensitivity of the liability value to changes in the principal assumptions If the discount rate were 0.1 per cent higher lower, the defined benefit section Scheme liabilities would decrease by approximately 6.6 million increase by 6.7 million if all the other assumptions remained unchanged.
If the inflation assumption were 0.1 per cent higher lower, the Scheme liabilities would increase by 2.2 million decrease by 2.1 million.
Inthis calculation all assumptions related to the inflation assumption have been appropriately adjusted, that is salary, the deferred pension andpension in payment increases.
The other assumptions remain unchanged.
If life expectancies were to increase decrease by 1 year, the Scheme liabilities would increase by 15.1 million decrease by 16.5 million ifallthe other assumptions remained unchanged.
Share-based payments Marshalls plc 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was replaced in 2014 by the Management Incentive Plan MIP and accordingly no further share-based payment awards were made during the year ended 31 December 2016 under the LTIP.
The LTIP awards made in respect of the 2014 scheme year provide for the award of Performance Shares.
Performance Shares may be awarded to participants without requiring a qualifying investment, and are subject to the achievement of a 3-year performance target.
The awards lapse if the performance target is not met over the 3-year vesting period.
Performance Share awards are dependent on an improvement in reported earnings per share and operating cash flow, each measured using IFRSs.
The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion with regard to the effect of one-off items.
Details of the performance criteria applicable to 2014 LTIP awards are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 65.

Reductions in the rate to 19 per cent effective April 2017 and 17 per cent effective April 2020 were substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred taxation liability at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on the rate at which the deferred tax is expected to unwind in the future using rates enacted at the balance sheet date.

The explanation as to why such liabilities may arise is included in the notes to the tax reconciliation Note 6.
The deferred tax balances on short-term timing differences are expected to reverse within 1 to 3 years.
Based on the current investment programme of the Group and assuming that current rates of capital allowances on fixed asset expenditure continue into the future, there is little prospect of any significant part of the deferred taxation liability of the Company becoming payable overthe next 3 years.
It is not realistic to make any projection after a 3-year period.
The deferred tax liabilities disclosed in the year ended 31 December 2016 include the deferred tax relating to the Groups pension scheme assets.
Deferred tax assets on capital losses and overseas trading losses have not been recognised due to uncertainty around the future use ofthe losses.
