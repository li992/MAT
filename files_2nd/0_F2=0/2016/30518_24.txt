Accordingly, in the period ended 27 December 2016, the Company has changed its accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS 101 during the period and has, in doing so, applied the requirements of IFRS 1.6.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The prior year financial statements were re-presented for adoption of FRS 101 in the current year.
There were no adjustments to Total Comprehensive Income or Equity on re-presentation.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
As the Company is a qualifying entity it has also applied the exemption from the requirement of IFRS 1 to present an opening Statement of Financial Position.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by theperiod end date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in abusiness combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where theCompany is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each period end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based ontax laws and rates that have been enacted at the period end date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with inequity.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction or atan average rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end date are reported atthe rates ruling at that date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Income Statement.
Finance costs Finance costs and income arising on interest-bearing financial instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance costs include the amortisation of fees that are an integral part of the effective finance cost of a financial instrument, including issue costs, and the amortisation of any other differences between the amount initially recognised and the redemption price.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of discounts and direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including the unwinding of any discounts, premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged on an accrual basis to the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Subsequent toinitial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost.
Any accrued finance costs areincluded in accruals within trade and other payables.

Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees within the William Hill PLC Group and operates a number of HMRC-approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes open to all eligible employees within the William Hill PLC Group, which allow the purchase of shares at a discount.
The cost to the Company of both of these types of share-based payments is measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is borne by the employing company within theGroup.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based onmanagements best estimates, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, thevalue of the option has also been adjusted to take into account any market conditions applicable to the option.
Further descriptions of the Groups share-based payment plans are given in note 31 to the Group financial statements.
Going concern A full description of the Groups business activities, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, committed facilities and borrowing position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, is set out in the Strategic Report, including the Financial Review, and in notes 22 and 23 to the Group financial statements.
As highlighted in notes 22 and 23 to the Group financial statements, the Group and the Company meet their day-to-day working capital requirements from the positive cash flows generated by their trading activities and their available cash resources.
These are supplemented when required by additional drawings under the Groups revolving credit bank loan facilities, which are committed until May 2019.
Whilst there are a number of risks to the Groups trading performance, as summarised in the Managing our risks section on pages 40 to 45, the Group and the Company are confident of their ability to continue to access sources of funding in the medium term.
The Company issued 350m of corporate bonds in May 2016 the proceeds from which were used to redeem 300m of corporate bonds which matured in November 2016.
The new bonds are due for redemption in 2023.
The Groups strategic forecasts, based on reasonable assumptions, indicate that the Group and the Company should be able to operate within the level of their currently available and expected future facilities and their banking covenants for the period of the strategic forecast.
After making enquiries and after consideration of the Groups existing operations, cash flow forecasts and assessment of business, regulatory and financing risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Companys accounting policies, the directors do not consider that there are any judgements, estimates or assumptions that could lead to a material change in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
