At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have notbeen applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU marked by : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

165 Annual report and accounts 2016 Drax Group plc SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED Following endorsement by the EU, the Group expects to adopt IFRS 9 in line with the 1 January 2018 effective date.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the recognition or measurement of the Groups financial instruments.
However, following adoption it is anticipated that more of the Groups forward purchase contracts will in future qualify for hedge accounting under the new standard than under the existing standard.
This will likely result in a greater proportion of unrealised gains and losses being recognised in the hedge reserve andan associated reduction in income statement volatility.
The Group is in the process of completing a preliminary impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15, which is expected to be adopted in line with the effective date of 1 January 2018.
Whilst further work is required, the Group expects to review and update its revenue recognition policies in light of the updated requirements.
Based on the initial findings of this process, a material change to the quantum and timing of profitability is considered unlikely at this stage.
The Group has not yet concluded its initial impact assessment into the adoption of IFRS 16: however at this stage the standard is not expected tohave a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of amounts within the financial statements in respect of leases.
TheGroup currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 in the period it becomes mandatory, subject to EU endorsement.
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
