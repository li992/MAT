These provisions are based on the least net cost of fulfilling or exiting the contract.
The calculation of the value in use of the leased properties to the Group is based on the same assumptions for growth rates and expected change in margins as those for Group owned properties, as discussed in detail in Note 11, discounted at the appropriate risk free rate.
The cost of exiting lease contracts is estimated as the present value of expected surrender premiums or deficits from subletting at market rents, assuming that the Group can sublet properties at market rents, based on discounting at the appropriate risk adjusted rate.
For some leases, termination of the lease at the break clause requires the Group to either purchase the property or buy out the equity ownership of the property at fair value.
No value is attributed to the purchase conditions since they are at fair value.
It is also assumed that the Group is indifferent to purchasing the properties.
Based on the factors set out above, the Group has recognised a net onerous property provision exceptional charge in the year of 150m 2015: 612m charge, largely relating to onerous lease contracts for fully impaired properties and other onerous contracts relating to properties.
The onerous property provision charge relates to contracts in the UK & ROI of 134m 2015: 574m and International of 16m 2015: 38m, with 130m 2015: 492m included within cost of sales and 20m 2015: 120m included within profits losses arising on property-related items.
Onerous lease provisions will be utilised over the lease terms.
Restructuring provisions Of the 89m net charge 166m charge, 77m release recognised in the year, 22m relating to changes to store colleague structures and working practices in the UK & ROI has been classified as an exceptional item within Net restructuring and redundancy costs within cost of sales.
An additional 34m relating to UK head office restructuring costs has been classified as an exceptional item within Net restructuring and redundancy costs within administrative expenses.
The exceptional charges are expected to be utilised in the next financial year.
The remaining 33m has not been included within exceptional items.
The prior year charge of 325m related to cost saving initiatives including in the UK a restructuring of central overheads, simplification of store management structures and increased flexibility in working arrangements and was classified as an exceptional item.
Other provisions The other provisions relate mainly to provisions for Tesco Bank customer redress in respect of potential complaints arising from the historical sales of Payment Protection Insurance PPI, in respect of customer redress relating to the historical sale of certain Cardholder Protection Products CPP to credit card customers and in respect of customer redress relating to instances where certain of the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act CCA for post contract documentation have not been fully complied with.
In each instance, management have exercised judgement as to both the timescale for implementing the redress campaigns and the final scope of any amounts payable.
