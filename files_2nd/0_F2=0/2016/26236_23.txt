What an audit of financial statements involves We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs UK & Ireland.
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

Distributions Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the company.

Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 225 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the company financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The companys activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates.
Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Pension costs The company participates in the group defined benefit schemes which are recognised on the Balance Sheet of Legal & General Resources Limited.
The companys cost of participation has been treated as that of a defined contribution schemes for reporting purposes.
In addition to these schemes the company also contributes to defined contribution schemes.
The company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred.
Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the balance sheet.
The assets of the defined benefit schemes and the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.
Share-based payments The company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries.
The fair value of the equity instruments granted is spread over the vesting period of the instrument and treated as a capital contribution to the respective subsidiary.
The total capital contribution is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
The capital contribution to the subsidiaries is accounted for as an increase in the investment in the parent companys financial statements.
At each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimate, if any, in the cost of the investment in the subsidiary and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the accumulated capital contribution and the actual cost to the company is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
Any capital contribution is subsequently recharged to the respective subsidiary as incurred and the corresponding cost of investment is reduced.
