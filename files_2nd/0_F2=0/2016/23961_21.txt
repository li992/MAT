Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 395KingStreet, Aberdeen, AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic report on pages4 to 46.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on agoing concern basis as described in the going concern statement within other statutory information on pages 103 to 104.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2016 include the results of the First Rail business for the year to 31 March 2016 and the results of all the otherbusinesses for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2016.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2015 include the results of the First Rail businesses for the year to 31 March 2015 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2015.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company itssubsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity soastoobtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of their fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisitions method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment and non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
As a general rule, significant influence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% ormore of the voting power, of the investee.
However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the voting power does not have significant influence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate.
The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst but does not have significant influence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associatein excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Thiscondition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the dateof classification.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum ofthe consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs which are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on thebasis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Ondisposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit orloss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being testedfor impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included indetermining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives as follows: Customer contracts over the estimated life of the contract 9 to 10 years Greyhound brand and trade name over the estimated life of the brand 20 years Franchise agreements over the initial term of the franchise 2 to 10 years Software Computer software is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, web-site development, costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the software.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years.
Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as the proportion of total services to be provided.
Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within Season ticket deferred income and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Revenue in First Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable under franchise arrangements.
Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
First Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts arerecognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales.
Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, andservices revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Allother leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve aconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
112 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies see note 24 for details of the Groups policies in respect of foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take asubstantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Non-GAAP measures and performance In measuring the Group adjusted performance, additional financial measures derived from the reported results have been used in order to eliminate factors which distort year on year comparisons.
The Groups adjusted performance is used to explain year on year changes when theeffect of certain items are significant, including other intangible asset amortisation, business disposals, aged legal and self-insurance claims, revisions to onerous contracts and pension settlement gains or losses, as management consider that this basis more appropriately reflects operating performance and a better understanding of the key performance indicators of the business.
See note 4 for the reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance.
Subsequent revisions to adjusting items are also recognised as an adjusting item in future periods.
In the current year non-GAAP adjusting items principally relate to other intangible asset amortisation charges, pension past service gain, aged self-insurance and legal claims and business disposals.
In the prior year the non-GAAP adjusting items principally related to amortisation charges, gain on disposal of property, aged legal claims associated with previous acquisitions, the impairment of a number of Group IT licences and business disposals.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Where changes to the benefits in payment on defined benefit pension schemes require a change in scheme rules or ratification by the Trustees, the change is recognised as a past service charge or credit in the income statement.
Where changes in assumptions can be made without changing the Trustee agreement these are recognised as a change in assumptions in other comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Various TOCs in the First Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities andwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on anetbasis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation oftheseassets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight-line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight-line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 17 years straight-line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight-line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Capital grants Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated inorder to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
114 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances forestimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Groups First Rail subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component ofequity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issuedby the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments forspeculative purposes.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred tothe income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required tosettle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals.
Self-insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
In addition there are typically a smaller number ofmajor claims during a financial year for which cover isobtained through third-party insurance policies subject to an insurance deductible.
Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for theestimated cost of settling uninsured claims forincidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value atthe date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes or other appropriate valuation models.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations for annual periods beginning on or after the effective dates as noted below: Effective for accounting periods IAS IFRS standards starting on or after 1 Amendments to IAS 27 August 2014 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016 1 Amendments to IAS 1 December 2015 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2016 1 Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 May 2014 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation 1 January 2016 andAmortisation 1 Amendments to IFRS 11 May 2014 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 2 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 December 2015 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016 2 Amendments to IAS 12 January 2016 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 January 2017 2 Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2017 2 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 2 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 2 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 3 Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 September 2014 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor See below anditsAssociate or Joint Venture 1 Mandatory for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2016 under EU adopting regulations.
2 The mandatory adoption under EU adopting regulations has not yet been confirmed.
3 The IASB has acknowledged a conflict between these amendments and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
In December 2015 the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28, deferring the effective date of the amendments indefinitely.
116 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 2 Significant accounting policies continued The Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these other standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application other than the following: IFRS 9 may impact the measurement and disclosure of the Groups financial instruments.
The potential impact of IFRS 15 is being assessed.
IFRS 16 is expected to result in a material increase to both assets and liabilities of the Group and will reduce operating costs and increase financecosts.
A full assessment of the impact of these new standards will be undertaken prior to their adoption.
Adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for a number of new and revised Standards andInterpretations which have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported inthese financial statements.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgments and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
Thevalue in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 1,736.3m 2015: 1,659.2m as set outin note 11 and thecarrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 162.2m 2015: 197.0m as setout in note 12.
Contract and franchise accounting Judgments are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and liabilitiesarising from franchises and long term service contracts.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises andcontracts, which require assessments and judgments relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, the life of the contract or franchise.
The useful economic lives of assets are determined by reference to the length of a franchise and matched to the franchise end date.
The residual value of assets is determined by their condition at the franchise end date and by the amount of maintenance that has been carried out during the period of operation.
In particular First Rail has a number of contractual relationships including those with the DfT and Network Rail.
Due to the regulated nature of therail industry, disputes and claims typically arise with such bodies as well as other TOCs where one or more TOCs have access to common infrastructure such as railway lines.
Judgment is required by management as to the amounts receivable and also payable taking account of the information available at the time.
Defined benefit pension arrangements Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of inflation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these are the discount rate and inflation rate assumptions.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 1m and 32m respectively.
A 0.1% movement in the inflation rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 1m and 26m respectively.
The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was 270.9m 2015: 239.4m as set out in note 35.
Self-insurance Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as required.
The Groups total self-insurance provisions, including those classified within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were 363.8m 2015:316.2m as set out in note 26.
Tax provisions Assessing the outcome of tax uncertainties requires judgements to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and enquires from tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions.

The Groups adjusted performance is used to explain year on year changes when theeffect of certain items are significant, including other intangible asset amortisation, business disposals, aged legal and self-insurance claims, revisions to onerous contracts and pension settlement gains or losses, as management consider that this basis more appropriately reflects operating performance and abetter understanding of the key performance indicators of the business.

The reduction primarily reflects a lower charge in First Rail as the GWR franchise intangible was fully expensed at the end of Direct Award 1 partly offset by a higher charge for First Student due to the full year effect of the Mile Square acquisition.
Legal claims A legal claim that pre-dates the Laidlaw acquisition and was acquired with the former Laidlaw entities had further adverse developments during the year and has been settled for 1.0m more than was originally provided for within adjusted items.
First Bus depot sales and closures There was a charge of 1.8m 2015: 7.5m in the year relating to operating losses on a legacy depot closure.
Pensions past service gain During the year we agreed with the FirstGroup Pension Scheme Trustee to change the basis for revaluing pensions in payment from RPI to CPI.
This change has led to a reduction in the liabilities and as a result 10.8m past service gain has been recognised.
North America Insurance reserves There have been significant adverse developments on a small number of old and unusual insurance claims in North America during the year.
Theimpact of these adverse developments was a charge of 10.5m.
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives There was a 0.4m 2015: 0.3m non-cash charge during the year due to ineffectiveness on financial derivatives.

The deferred tax credit adjustment with respect to prior years primarily reflects the release of prior year provisions in addition to the transfer to current tax.
UK corporation tax is calculated at 20% 2015: 21% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 m % m % Profit before tax 113.5 100.0 105.8 100.0 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 20% 2015: 21% 22.7 20.0 22.2 21.0 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 2.0 1.7 1.8 1.7 Impact of subsidiaries operating outside of the UK 5.1 4.5 2.9 2.7 Impact of reduction in UK tax rate on current years deferred tax 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 Impact of reduction in UK tax rate on prior years deferred tax 0.7 0.6 Adjustments relating to taxation of prior years results transactions 11.6 10.2 6.8 6.4 Tax charge and effective tax rate for the year 17.1 15.1 20.3 19.2 The Group recognises provisions in respect of tax for items which are considered to have a range of possible tax outcomes in its open tax returns and its ongoing tax audits in respect of multiple years.
These uncertainties exist due to a number of factors including differing interpretations of local tax laws.
The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the carrying amounts relate to the estimated tax which could be payable as a result of differing interpretations and decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
The 2016 adjustment in respect of prior year primarily reflects a change in Groups judgement on those potential liabilities including whether certain liabilities are more likely than not.
The group maintains engagement with tax authorities and engagement with peer groups that may have similar issues.
We engage advisers to obtain opinion on tax legislation and we monitor proposed changes in legislation.
Future years tax charges would be impacted if the final liability for currently open years is different from the amount currently provided for.
Thefuture tax charge may also be affected by the levels and mix of profits in the countries in which we operate, the prevailing tax rates and taxrules in each of those countries and also the foreign exchange rates that apply to those profits.
At the balance sheet date changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020 have been substantively enacted.
A further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been announced but not enacted.
In addition to the amount credited charged to the income statement, deferred tax relating to actuarial losses gains 16.1 m 2015: 6.7m andcash flow and net investment hedges 0.6 m 2015: 26.6 m, amounting to a total charge of 16.7m 2015: 19.9m have been recognised in other comprehensive income.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2016 2015 m m Carrying amount First Student 1,123.0 1,073.5 First Transit 273.2 259.5 Greyhound 257.6 244.6 First Bus 76.9 76.0 First Rail 5.6 5.6 1,736.3 1,659.2 124 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 11 Goodwill continued Impairment testing At the year end the carrying value of goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising ineach relevant CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2016 17 and Three Year Plan projections up to 2018 19 2015: Five Year Plan whichtake account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
The projections for First Student assume the incremental benefits of the existing recovery plan, the programme to address contract portfolio pricing together with an economic recovery.
Cashflows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2015: 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% 2015: 3.0% for North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the market.
Cash flows are discounted using apre-tax discount rate of 8.1% 2015: 9.0% for the United Kingdom CGUs and 8.9% 2015: 10.0% for the North American CGUs to arrive at thevalue in use.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from a market participants weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the Groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount in respect of the First Transit, Greyhound, First Bus and First Rail divisions.
The value in use of the First Student division exceeds its carrying amount by 232.3m 2015: 300.9m.
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the First Student margin would need to fall in excess of 87 basis points compared to medium term expectations, or long term growth rates would need to fall in excess of 66 basis points for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business.
An increase in the discount rate in excess of 59 basis points would lead to the value in use of the division being less than its carrying amount.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment to any of the CGUs.

The Group does not consider any of these counterparties to be asignificant risk.
Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by lending banks and large banks with aminimum of A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board.

Capital management Overall the Groups objective is to achieve a post-tax return on capital employed ROCE in the range of 10% to 12% in the medium term.
We also aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and appropriate balance sheet liquidity headroom.
The Group has net debt:EBITDA of 2.3 times as at March 2016 2015: 2.3 times and is targeting net debt:EBITDA of 2.0 times in the medium term.
ROCE is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit after tax by net assets, excluding debt items.
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong.
At 31 March 2016 there was 940.2m 2015: 1,023.8m of committed headroom and free cash.
Largely due to seasonality in the North American school bus business, committed headroom typically reduces during the financial year up to October and increases thereafter.
The Groups Treasury policy requires a minimum of 150m of committed headroom at all times.
The Groups net debt, excluding accrued bond interest at 31 March 2016, was 1,410.2m 2015: 1,407.3m as set out on page 46 of the Financial review.

The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Chief Financial Officer and to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee comprises the Chief Financial Officer and certain senior finance employees and is responsible for approving hedging transactions permitted under Board approved policies, monitoring compliance against policy and recommending changes to existing policies.
134 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 24 Derivative financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The objective of the Groups liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient committed liquidity resources exist.
The Group has a diversified debt structure largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and finance leases.
Itisa policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 150m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates.
At 31 March 2016, the total amount of these facilities stood at 800.0m 2015: 800.0m, and committed headroom was 800.0m 2015: 800.0m, in addition to free cash balances of140.2m 2015: 223.8m.
The next material contractual expiry of revolver bank facilities is in June 2019.
Largely due to theseasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increases again by the followingMarch.
The average duration of net debt excluding ring-fenced cash at 31 March 2015 was 4.4 years 2015: 5.2 years.
The following tables detail the Groups expected maturity of payables receivables for its derivative financial instruments.
The amounts in thesetables are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
Total amounts receivable per the tables are 92.4m 2015:114.3m.
No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
Currency risk Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in pounds Sterling due to movements inexchange rates.
The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
Consequently the principal currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling.
Certain and highly probable foreign currency transaction exposures may be hedged at the time the exposure arises for up to two years atspecified levels, or longer if there is a very high degree of certainty.
The Group does not hedge the translation of earnings into the Group reporting currency pounds Sterling, but accepts that reported Group earnings will fluctuate as exchange rates against pounds Sterling fluctuate for the currencies in which the company does business.
During the year, the net cash generated in each currency may be converted by Group Treasury into pounds Sterling by way of spot transactions in order to keep the currency composition of net debt broadly constant.
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange rates.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar.
The analysis has been prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.
Apositive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.

The Group treasury policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum of 50% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS.
The policy objective is primarily achieved through fixed rate debt.
The main floating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and pounds Sterling LIBOR.
This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 4.6 years 2015:5.3years.
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the 250.0m 2019 and the 350.0m 2021 Sterling bonds relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps offset the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bonds.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis points 1% increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant.

The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis.
The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on anet basis.

The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for potentially lower costs over the medium term.
The Group primarily uses fixed rate swap instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty.
During the year to 31 March 2016, the Group was hedged 82% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2016 to March 2019 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31March 2017.
The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.
Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs within operating results.

Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases filed or thought highly likely to be filed for incidents that occurred prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within 10 years.
Also included are provisions in respect of costs anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases and dilapidation and other provisions in respect of contractual obligations under rail franchises.
The dilapidation provisions are expected to be settled at the end ofthe respective franchise.
The pensions provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain First Bus companies.
It is anticipated that this will be utilised over five to 10 years.

The 12.2m consideration represents 11.0m cash paid in the year to 31 March 2015 and 1.2m of deferred consideration.
Included within the purchase agreement is a put option for the Group to purchase the remaining 49% from the non-controlling interest party for afixed price of US$19.1m.
As the put option is a contract to purchase the Groups own equity instruments it gives rise to a financial liability for thefixed price amount in accordance with paragraph 23 in IAS 32.
We have recognised the financial liability in the balance sheet and the initial recognition is treated as reclassified from equity.
The business acquired during the year contributed nil 2015: 6.4m to the Groups net operating cash flows and utilised nil 2015:11.0m for capital expenditure.

UK The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all Group and First Bus division employees who have joined a pension arrangement since January 2011 and April 2013, respectively.
They will receive a Company match to their contributions, which varies by salaryand or service level.
North America Employees in the US have been able to join a defined contribution arrangement for many years.
They will receive a Company match to their contributions, which varies by employment status.
The Company match is 50% of member contributions, to a Company maximum of 3% forfull-time employees and $250 per annum for part-time employees.
All new employees in Canada join a defined contribution arrangement.
Union employees join the Eastern or Western plan, dependent upon theirgeographical location, whilst managers and supervisors join the Supervisory plan.
Members of the Western andSupervisory plans can contribute 2%, 3%, 4% or 5%, and receive a 50% Company match.
Members of the Eastern plan may contribute 2%, 3% or 4%, and receive a100% Company match.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement of 18.2m 2015: 23.0m represents contributions payable to these plans bythe Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans The Group sponsors 16 funded defined benefit plans across its operations, covering approximately 70,000 former and current employees.
UK The majority of defined benefit provision is through Trust-based schemes.
With the exception of the Railways Pension Schemes RPS, these arrangements are now closed to new entrants.
In these arrangements the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group, and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards.
The Trustee board of the pension schemes is required by law, or by their Articles of Association, to act in the best interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i. e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees, beneficiaries and employers.
There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have some member representation with the other Trustees being company appointed.
The Trustee board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the fund, although the Company must be consulted on this, and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the cost of future service is calculated and the funding position established.
The Company and Trustee board are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this.
The contributions mayneed to incorporate deficit recovery contributions in addition to future service contributions, if a deficit position is determined through the valuation.
If a surplus is shown at the valuation, this may be used to reduce future service contributions.
In agreeing contribution rates, reference must be made to the affordability of contributions by the employer.
In most arrangements, any surplus after benefits have been paid secured, can be repaid to the employer.
The First UK Bus Pension Scheme This predominantly provides pension benefits to employees in the First Bus division.
Historically the scheme provided final salary benefits and career average benefits.
However, with effect from April 2012, the scheme provides career average benefits with a retirement age linked to State Pension age and a cap on the pensionable pay on which defined benefits can be built.
The defined benefit pensionable pay is capped at 21,580 per annum, with defined contribution benefit building on any pensionable pay above thisamount.
The costs of future service are shared between the employer and member, so that the employer and employees each meets 50% of the cost.
The funding level of the scheme will be calculated on 5 April 2017, and if agreed funding levels are not achieved, the scheme will close to defined benefit accrual 12 months later.
In addition there is a smaller Group scheme which provides defined benefit pensions to Group employees and executives.
This closed to new entrants in 2011.
This scheme is subject to the same funding level test at 5 April 2017 as The First UK Bus Pension Scheme, and will also close todefined benefit accrual from April 2018 if the First Bus scheme does.
During the year the Trustee of the Group scheme agreed to change the index used for the revaluation of pensions from the Retail Price Index RPI to the Consumer Price Index CPI.
This produced a past service gain of 10.8m in the year.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 145 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Retirement benefit schemes continued The Railways Pension Scheme The Group currently sponsors four sections of the RPS, relating to its franchising obligations for its TOCs, and for Hull Trains, its Open Accessoperator.
Under this scheme members build a 1 60th pension and 1 40th lump sum based upon their pensionable pay.
Some members of the RPS are subject to Protected Persons legislation, which requires individual consent to changes to benefits, and certain rights upon transfer between sections of the scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost arrangement.
All costs, and any deficit or surplus is shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the members.
Furthermore, under the franchising obligations, the responsibility of the employer is to pay the contributions requested of the Trustee whilst itoperates the franchise.
There is no residual liability or asset for any deficit, or surplus, which remains at the end of the franchise period.
During the year, some changes to benefits were agreed with members of the TOC sections, to take account of the fact that the RPS would no longer be contracted-out from April 2016.
Pensionable pay growth for past service benefits is capped at RPI plus 0.25%.
The Normal Pension Age for future service has also increased to 62 for members who are not Protected Persons.
The pensionable pay cap has resulted in a past service gain of 28.8m.
Given the franchise nature of these operations, the balance sheet franchise adjustment has decreased by an offsetting 28.8m, recognising that not all of this benefit will be available to First Rail, and that the element that will be available will be recognised in full via lower cash obligations during the remainder of the franchise.
In calculating the Groups pension obligations in respect of the RPS the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit which is projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated bythe Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
Allowance is also made in the preparation of the financial statements for the cost sharing nature of the benefit and in particular, only 60% of the total profit and loss charge and balance sheet position are attributed to the Group and recognised in theaccounts.
Hull Trains is not subject to franchising obligations, and as such it is accounted for under IAS 19 as a defined benefit scheme, although subject to the same cost sharing obligations as for the franchised sections.
The Group has re-estimated the calculation of the franchise adjustment under IAS19 revised to better reflect the commercial terms and shorter duration of the GWR and TPE franchises.
This change in accounting estimate has been triggered by the new Direct Awards operated by GWR and First TransPennine Express in the year and has been applied prospectively from 1 April 2015.
As a result of this change in accounting estimate the operating profit charge for First Rail pension schemes for the full year is 18.6m lower at 27.4m than it would otherwise have been.
The change in the basis of estimate has no effect on the cash contributions made to the First Rail pension schemes in the year.
Local Government Pension Schemes The Group participates in five Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS, three in England and two in Scotland.
These differ from Trust-based schemes in that their benefits are prescribed by legislation, and they are administered by local authorities, and pension committees consisting of local councillors.
Typically the Group has less control over the investment strategy adopted by the LGPS compared to the UK Trust-based schemes.
Historically benefit accrual in these schemes has been based on final salary.
The benefit structure changed to a 1 47th career average benefit in England in April 2014 and in Scotland in April 2015.
Normal pension age will be aligned with State Pension Age from that time.
Some members have a right to receive some of their benefits on an unreduced basis, conditional on age and service.
As with the Trust-based schemes, valuations take place at least triennially.
Generally contribution rates are agreed for the three year period untilthe next valuation.
Whilst these are balance of cost schemes, at termination there is no right for the Company to receive any surplus in the schemes, although there is an obligation on the Company to fully fund the benefits.
To reflect this, the Group only recognise existing surpluses relating to the LGPS when determining the balance sheet position, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped by the reduction of futurecompany contributions.
North America US The Group operates two defined benefit arrangements in the US.
These are legacy arrangements with benefit accrual having ceased some years ago.
The schemes are valued annually, when the funding position and minimum and maximum contributions are established.
Changes in funding position create new surplus or deficit each year, which is normally spread over seven years, as required by legislation.
However, funding relief passed by Congress has allowed greater flexibility following the global financial crisis, having the effect of increasing thefunding discount rate, which acts to lower liabilities, deficits and contributions or spreading deficit payments over a longer period.
Greyhound Canada There are three plans, relating to Eastern, Western and Supervisory employees.
All these plans are now closed to new members, although benefitaccrual continues for existing members.
Very small executive arrangements also exist.
The plans are valued annually, where the cost of future service and the funding position are identified.
Future service costs are shared in proportion between the members and the Company, although there are caps on the member rates.
Deficit contributions are met entirely by theCompany.
Cash contributions are required to fund the plans on a going concern basis, whilst the usually higher solvency deficit can be made good through a combination of cash contributions and Letters of Credit.
There is a cap on the value of the Letter of Credit, which cannot exceed 15% of the value of the assets heldin the plan.
Valuations At their last valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 76.2% and 105.4% 2015: 74.1% and 105.1%.
Themarket value of the assets at 31 March 2016 for all defined benefit schemes totalled 4,045m 2015: 4,146m.

The net present value reflects the current value of deficit recovery payments that would be required to meet the actuarial deficit in full, discounted at 9.0% per annum.
Management consider that, were a pension asset to arise in respect of this scheme, this would be fully recoverable through actions within the Groups control, in line with the rules of the scheme.
The estimated amounts of employer contributions expected to be paid to the defined benefit schemes during the financial year to 31 March 2017 is 94.8m year to 31 March 2016: 88.3m.
Risks associated with defined benefit plans: Generally the number of employees in defined benefit plans is reducing rapidly, as these plans are largely closed to new entrants, and in many cases to future accrual.
Consequently, the number of defined contribution members is increasing.
Furthermore, changes have been implemented to the First UK Bus Pension Scheme with effect from April 2015 which allow for the closure of thescheme if the funding level is not in line with the target level.
This change will serve to limit the risks associated with defined benefit pension provision by the Group.
Despite remaining open to new entrants and future accrual, the risks posed by the RPS are limited, as under the franchise arrangements, the First Rail TOCs are not responsible for any residual deficit at the end of a franchise.
As such, there is only short term cash flow risk within this business.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 151 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Retirement benefit schemes continued The key risks relating to the defined benefit pension arrangements and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate them are as follows: Risk Description Mitigation Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with Asset liability modelling has been undertaken to ensure that reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform any risks taken are expected to be rewarded.
this yield, this will create a deficit.
Most of the defined benefit arrangements hold a significant proportion of return-seeking assets equities, diversified growth funds and global absolute return funds which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk inthe short term.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the UK benefit obligations The business has certain inflation linking in its revenue arelinked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to streams, which helps to offset this risk.
investment strategy reviews have led to increased inflation hedging, mainly through swaps or holding Index Linked Gilts in the UK schemes.
Uncertainty over Contributions to defined benefit schemes can be The Group engages with the Trustees and Administering level offuture unpredictable and volatile as a result of changes in Authorities to consider how contribution requirements contributions thefunding level revealed at each valuation.
The level of volatility and the Groupsability to control contribution levels varies betweenarrangements.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide Linking retirement age to State Pension Age as in the First benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life UK Bus Pension Scheme and LGPS has mitigated this risk expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
Trapped surplus At termination of LGPS arrangements there is no right This issue is discussed with the Administering Authorities forthecompany to receive any surplus that exists within when contribution schedules are set, and the Group receives thescheme.
Therefore there is a risk of overfunding professional advice on potential ways of mitigating some of theschemes.
Legislative risk Future legislative changes are uncertain.
In the past these The Group receives professional advice on the impact have led to increases in obligations, through introducing oflegislative changes.
