Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2016 Directors remuneration continued Annual Report on remuneration continued 2017 remuneration Details of how the remuneration policy will be implemented for the 2017 financial year are set out below.
2017 base salaries The Remuneration Committee considered business performance, salary increases for other UK employees and external market information and decided to increase the salary of the Chief Financial Officer by 2.0% which is in line with the average salary increase budget for all employees across the UK.
The Chief Executive requested not to be considered for a salary increase during the review.
The average salary increase for Executive Committee members will be 2.5%: this compares to a budget of 2.4% which is based on an average of the relevant local market budget for each Executive Committee member.
The annual salaries for 2017 effective 1 July 2016 are as follows: a Chief Executive: Vittorio Colao 1,150,000: and a Chief Financial Officer: Nick Read 714,000.
2017 annual bonus GSTIP The performance measures and weightings for 2017, which remain unchanged from 2016, are as follows: a service revenue 20% : a EBITDA 20% : a adjusted free cash flow 20% : and a customer appreciation KPIs 40%.
This includes an assessment of net promoter score NPS and brand consideration measures.
In respect of the measures included under the customer appreciation KPIs, net promoter score is used as a measure of the extent to which our customers would recommend us, whilst brand consideration acts as a measure of the percentage of people who would consider using a certain brand as their telecoms provider.
Both measures utilise data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies.
The data is sourced from studies involving both our own customers and customers of our competitors for the NPS measure, and both Vodafone users and non-users for the brand consideration measure.
In formulating a final assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs, the Committee will also consider other relevant customer factors such as churn, customer growth and service levels.
Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed in the 2017 remuneration report following the completion of the financial year.
