EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Accounting policy The Group measures earnings per share on an underlying basis.
This differs from earnings defined in IAS 33 Earnings per share.
Underlying earnings is profit loss attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature: amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent: and other infrequent and or exceptional transactions that are significant or material inthecontext of the Groups normal business earnings for the period.
The table below provides the basis of underlying earnings.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Classification and measurement Accounting policy The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to-maturity: or available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities are classified as either held at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
The following details the approach for the categories: a Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss: This category has two sub-categories: Financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
A financial asset or liability is classified as held for trading if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, or forms part of a portfolio of financial instruments which are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking or is a derivative excluding qualifying hedging relationships Designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when: The designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis for example, the Group may designate certain fixed rate loans and receivables that are managed with derivative interest rate swaps A group of financial assets and or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis for example, the Group may designate issued debt to fund a portfolio of trading assets and liabilities that are all managed on a fair value basis The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately b Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and it is expected that apart from credit deterioration substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered.
com 221 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued c Held-to-maturity assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
d Available-for-sale assets are those non-derivative financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to liquidity requirements or changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or equity prices.
e F inancial liabilities held at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities, which include borrowings not classified as held at fair value through profit or loss, are classified as amortised cost instruments.
Preference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders, are classified as financial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
A financial guarantee issued is a special case of financial liability.
Under a financial guarantee contract the Group, in return for a fee, undertakes to meet customers obligations under the terms of a debt instrument if the customer fails to do so.
A financial guarantee is recognised as a liability: initially at fair value and, if not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, subsequently at the higher of its initial value less cumulative amortisation and any provision under the contract measured in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Amortisation is calculated so as to recognise fees receivable in profit or loss over the period of the guarantee.
Initial recognition of financial instruments All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price plus, for those financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
In certain circumstances the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of profits or losses at the time of initial recognition.
However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primarily on observable market data.
In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement.
The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss, and financial assets classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, are initially recognised on the trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way loans are recognised on settlement date when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to the net trading income line in the income statement, except for changes in fair value on financial liabilities designated at fair value attributable to the Groups own credit presented directly within other comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken to the available-for-sale reserve within equity until the asset is sold, or is impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost, with any difference between proceeds net of directly attributable transaction costs and the redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
In addition to these instruments, the carrying value of a financial instrument carried at amortised cost that is the hedged item in a qualifying fairvalue hedge relationship is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Reclassification of financial instruments: Reclassifications of financial assets or financial liabilities between measurement categories are not permitted following initial recognition, otherthan: Held for trading non-derivative financial assets can only be transferred out of the held at fair value through profit or loss category in the following circumstances: to the available-for-sale category, where, in rare circumstances, they are no longer held for the purpose of selling orrepurchasing in the near term: or to the loan and receivables category, where they are no longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term and they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity Financial assets can only be transferred out of the available-for-sale category to the loan and receivables category where they would have met the definition of a loan and receivable at the date of reclassification and the Group has the intent and ability to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity 222 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 13.

This reclassification was made possible through the circumstances of the credit crisis in financial markets which significantly impacted the liquidity in certain markets.
The carrying value and fair value of securities reclassified into loans and receivables is $79 million 2015: $123 million and $80 million 2015: $120 million respectively.
If the reclassifications had not been made, the Groups income statement for 2016 would have included a net gain on the reclassified trading assets of $1 million 2015: gain of $1 million.
There have been no reclassifications since 2008.
Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
In practice, for credit mitigation, the Group is able to offset assets and liabilities which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criteria set out above.
Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivatives and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions.
These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.
In addition the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivative transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default.
Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements the Group pledges legally sells and obtains legally purchases respectively, highly liquid assets which can be sold in the event of a default.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Valuation of financial instruments Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date in the principal market or, in the absence of this, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date.
The fair value of a liability reflects the Groups non-performance risk.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on the basis of the individual financial instrument.
However, when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis.
The fair values of quoted financial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices.
A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use nonmarket observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
The Valuation Control function is responsible for independent price verification, oversight of fair value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues.
Independent price verification is the process of determining the valuations incorporated into the financial statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product.
The Valuation Control function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure the financial instruments are priced to exit.
These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements.
The market data used for price verification may include those sourced from recent trade data involving external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pricing providers.
Valuation Control performs a semi-annual review of the suitability of the market data used for price testing.
Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in.
To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.
Formal committees for the business clusters, consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Control and the business meet monthly to discuss and approve the valuations of the inventory.
The Principal Finance valuation committee meetings are held on aquarterly basis.
The business cluster valuation committees fall under the Valuation Benchmarks Committee VBC as part the of the valuation governance structure.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Group evaluates the significance of financial instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements asthey involve a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Fair value of financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques see below which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs.
Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financial instruments When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value see page 229 In determining the valuation of financial instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the significant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments see page 230 Where the measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a significant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs Valuation techniques Refer to page 230 for an explanation of the Fair value hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3.
Financial instruments held at fair value Loans and advances: These include loans in the global syndications business which were not syndicated as of the balance sheet date andother financing transactions within Financial Markets.
These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation isbased on market observable credit spreads.
If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparable loans withsimilar credit grade, sector, and region, are used.
Where observable credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classified as Level 2.
Where there are no recent transactions or comparable loans, these loans are classified as Level 3.
Debt securities asset backed securities: Asset backed securities are priced based on external prices obtained from consensus pricing providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers quotes, etc.
Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classified as Level 2.
In instances where third party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classified as Level 3.
The fair value ofLevel 3 securities is estimated using market standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings.
Therefore, once external pricing has been verified, an assessment is made whether each security is traded with significant liquidity based on its credit rating and sector.
If a security is of high credit rating and is traded in a liquid sector, it will be classified as Level 2, otherwise it will be classified as Level 3. www.
com 227 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Other debt securities: These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes.
Where quoted prices are available through pricing vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classified as Level 2 and valued using such quotes.
Where there are significant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classified as Level 3.
The valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such asbond spreads and credit spreads.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxied from comparable issuers or assets Equity shares private equity: The majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples Price-toEarnings P E or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation EV EBITDA ratios of comparable listed companies.
The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies.
In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternate valuation techniques for example, discounted cash flow models, which use predominantly unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs, may be applied.
Even though earnings multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third party sources for example, Bloomberg, and those inputs can bedeemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, OTC prices are classified as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgments ranging from determining comparable companies to discountrates where the discounted cash flow method is applied Derivatives: Derivative products are classified as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources.
Derivative products are classified as Level 3 if there are significant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable.
Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with quanto payouts.
These unobservable correlation parameters could only be implied from the market, through methods such as historical analysis and comparison to historical levels or benchmark data Debt securities in issue: These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group.
Where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and broker sources these positions are classified as Level 2.
Where such liquid external prices are not available, valuation of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classified as Level 3.
These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer if available or proxies from comparable issuers or assets Financial instruments held at amortised cost The following sets out the Groups basis of establishing fair values of amortised cost financial instruments and their classification between Levels 1, 2 and 3.
As certain categories of financial instruments are not traded, there is a significant level of management judgement involved incalculating the fair values Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
The Groups loans and advances to customers portfolio is well diversified by geography and industry.
Approximately a quarter of the portfolio re-prices within one month, and approximately half re-prices within 12 months.
Loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value, subject to any significant movement in credit spreads.
The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and, where appropriate, credit spreads.
Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value.
The Group has a wide range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a result providing quantification of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical Investment securities: For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value.
Where available, securities are valued using inputs proxies from the same or closely related underlying for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer or inputs proxies from a different underlying for example, a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating.
Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs.
This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relate to asset backed securities.
The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the underlying cash flows.
The Group has a wide range of individual investments within the unlisted debt securities portfolio.
Given the number of instruments involved, providing quantification of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical, with no one assumption being material Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
Following the adoption of IFRS 13 the Group also adjusts the fair value of deposits and borrowings for own credit adjustment using the principles described above Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity 228 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 13.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value adjustments When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market participants would make when pricing that instrument.
The main valuation adjustments in determining fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows: 2016 2015 Valuation adjustments $million $million Bid-offer 106 72 1 Credit 443 815 Own credit 331 703 Model 6 13 Funding 248 366 Others including day one 132 169 Total 1,266 2,138 1.
Includes debit valuation adjustments on derivatives Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Where market parameters are marked on a mid market basis in the revaluation systems, a bid offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the business positions through dealing away in the market, thereby bringing long positions to bid and short positions to offer.
The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long positions are marked to bid and short positions marked to offer in the systems Credit valuation adjustment CVA : The Group makes CVA adjustments against the fair value of derivative products.
CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to reflect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions.
It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price toacquire our exposures.
CVA is calculated for each subsidiary, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold.
The Group calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default PD on the potential estimated future positive exposure of the counterparty using market-implied PD.
Where market-implied data is not readily available, we use market based proxies to estimate the PD.
The methodologies do not, in general, account for wrong-way risk.
Wrong-way risk arises when the underlying value of the derivative prior to any CVA is positively correlated to the probability of default by the counterparty.
The Group continues to include wrong-way risk in its Prudential Valuation Adjustments In 2015 the Group enhanced its methodology for estimating the CVA for derivatives.
Prior to 2015 the CVA was based on an expected counterparty loss calculation using historical default probabilities whereas the enhanced methodology uses market-implied default probabilities.
In addition, the funding valuation adjustment FVA was also enhanced moving from bank internal funding rates to market-based rates.
The net effect of the changes in estimates in 2015 was to reduce net trading income by $863 million Debit valuation adjustment DVA : The Group calculates DVA adjustments to reflect changes in its own credit standing.
The Groups DVA adjustments are calculated on its derivative liabilities.
The Groups DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
The Groups DVA adjustments will reverse over time as its derivatives mature.
For derivative liabilities, aDVA adjustment is determined by applying the Groups probability of default to the Groups negative expected exposure against the counterparty.
The Groups probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on internally assessed credit ratings and market standard recovery levels.
The expected exposure is modelled based on simulation methodology and is generated through simulation of underlying risk factors over the life of the deal booked against the particular counterparty.
This simulation methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements.
The methodology used to determine a DVA adjustment on derivative liabilities is consistent with the methodology used to determine CVA on derivative assets Own credit adjustment OCA : The Group calculates OCA adjustments to reflect changes in its own credit standing.
The Groups OCA adjustments are calculated on its issued debt designated at fair value, including structured notes.
The Groups OCA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves.
The Groups OCA adjustments will reverse over time as its liabilities mature.
For issued debt and structured notes designated at fair value, an OCA adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using a yield curve adjusted for market observed secondary senior debt issuance spreads above average interbank rates In December 2016, the Group refined its calculation of OCA by incorporating a more accurate calculation of the expected maturity of callable structured notes.
This calculation change is treated as a change in estimate and resulted in a decrease in the OCA balance of $141 million Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pricing deficiencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment.
These pricing deficiencies or limitations arise due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model Funding valuation adjustment FVA : The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivative products.
FVA reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs that could arise in relation to the exposure.
FVA is calculated by determining the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding.
The FVA for collateralised derivatives is based on discounting the expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap OIS rate after taking into consideration the terms of the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty.
The FVA for uncollateralised including partially collateralised derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these transactions.
The FVA calculation was previously based on the Groups internal funding rates.
As at 31 December 2015, the calculation was revised to use market based rates.
The change in estimate reduced net trading income by $151 million Day one profit or loss: In certain circumstances the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of profits or losses at the time of initial recognition.
The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated www.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments held at fair value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the observability of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values.
Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a significant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques asatthe end of the reporting period.
Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data The following tables show the classification of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy.

The ranges of values shown in the above table represent the highest and lowest levels used in the valuation of the Groups Level 3 financial instruments as at 31 December 2016.
The ranges of values used are reflective of the underlying characteristics of these Level 3 financial instruments based on the market conditions at the balance sheet date.
However, these ranges of values may not represent the uncertainty in fair value measurements of the Groups Level 3 financial instruments 2.
Weighted average for non-derivative financial instruments has been calculated by weighting inputs by the relative fair value.
Weighted average for derivatives has been provided by weighting inputs by the risk relevant to that variable.
N A has been entered for the cases where weighted average is not a meaningful indicator The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the valuation technique table: Credit spreads represent the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument Recovery rates is the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan.
As the probability of default increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increasingly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default.
An increase in the recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan www.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Comparable price yield is a valuation methodology in which a price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices.
Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash-flows in a discounted cash-flow model.
Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield or spread over a liquid benchmark from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjusting that yield or spread to derive a value for the instrument.
The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financial instruments such as maturity and or credit quality.
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument for example, deriving a fair value for a junior unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond.
An increase in price, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement inthe fair value of the asset.
An increase in yield, in isolation, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable.
An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.
Generally, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point of time EV EBITDA ratio multiples is the ratio of Enterprise Value EV to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA.
EV is the aggregate market capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents.
An increase in EV EBITDA multiple in isolation, will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Price-Earnings P E multiples is the ratio of the Market Capitalisation to the Net Income after tax.
The multiples are determined from multiples of listed comparables, which are observable.
An increase in P E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments: A liquidity discount is primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted firms investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded.
An increase in liquidity discount will result in unfavourable movement inthe fair value of the unlisted firm Price-Book P B multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity.
An increase in P B multiple will result inafavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm Price-Sales P S multiple: This is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales.
