The Group reduces risk through its credit control process and by contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoices on their behalf.
The Groups exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
The risk disclosures contained on pages 42 to 45 within the Strategic Report form part of these financial statements.
