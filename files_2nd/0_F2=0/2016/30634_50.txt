Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2016 Directors remuneration continued Annual Report on remuneration continued 2016 remuneration In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2016 financial year versus 2015.
Specifically we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration figure for the year.
The value of the annual bonus GSTIP reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash in the following year.
Similarly the value of the long-term incentive GLTI reflects the share awards which will vest in June 2016 as a result of the performance through the three year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2016.
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.
If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting downwards.
On this occasion, based on the fact that final annual bonus payout and final vesting level long-term incentives awards GLTI were deemed to be an accurate reflection of performance and were considered fair and appropriate, the Committee did not use its discretion to adjust final outcomes.

During the year under review, service revenue performance was slightly above budget, with both Europe and AMAP regions recording above target performances.
EBITDA results also demonstrated above target performance, with both Europe and AMAP again recording equally strong performances.
With regards to Adjusted Free Cash Flow, overall performance reflected particularly strong AMAP performance, with our Europe region recording below target results.
An assessment of performance under the Customer Appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market by market basis, with these scores then being subject to a revenue-weighted average to give an overall performance achievement.
Performance was primarily judged against an assessment of net promoter score and brand consideration for both consumer and enterprise operations, where applicable, within each market.
Additional consideration was then given to other relevant factors including customer churn rates and revenue market share.
Group performance for the year was slightly above target reflecting our position as Consumer NPS leader in 13 out of 21 markets an increase from our previous position as leader in 11 markets.
