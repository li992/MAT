NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS The Consolidated Financial Statements of Computacenter plc Parent Company or the Company and its subsidiaries the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 13 March 2017.
The Consolidated Balance Sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Groups Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, except for the adoption of new and amended IFRS that are applicable to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.
They may however give rise to additional disclosures.
The other pronouncements which came into force during the year were not relevant to the Group.
The following new or revised standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board have not been applied in preparing these accounts as their effective dates fall in years beginning after 31 December 2016.
Effective for the year ending 31 December 2017 IAS 16 and IAS 38 Amendments relating to Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation.
IAS 27 Amendments relating to Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements.
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Amendments relating to Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture.
IFRS 11 Amendments relating to Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations.
Effective for the year ending 31 December 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Finalised version, incorporating requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, general hedge accounting and derecognition.
Effective for the year ending 31 December 2019 IFRS 16 Leases.
Managements assessment of the impact and accepted best practice is ongoing.
Certain of these standards and interpretations will, when adopted, require addition to or amendment of disclosures in the accounts.
With the exception of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, it is not anticipated that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
Management is currently assessing the implication of IFRS 16 on the Group Financial Statements but has not yet formed a conclusion.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, becomes effective for the Group on 1 January 2018.
The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognised at the date of initial application the cumulative catch-up transition method.
The Group is currently performing a detailed analysis of the impact of IFRS 15 on its business.
The preliminary analysis has identified various areas in which adjustments may be required in revenue and cost recognition and in the related procedures and processes.
The most significant of these is expected to be that some of our Supply Chain revenue, which has previously been presented gross, will be presented net under IFRS 15 as agency revenue.
This change is likely to impact our Software sales and certain Resold Services, which contributed 337 million and 298 million to the Groups gross revenue in 2016 respectively.
Additional areas of difference identified include: the method in which we recognise revenue over time on some of our Managed Services and Professional Services contracts may need to change, for example to utilise output-driven as opposed to input-driven methods to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised, or to recognise revenue upon achievement of certain performance milestones in the contracts: the identification and recognition of revenue for separate, distinct performance obligations in our Professional Services contracts may change, for example in areas such as Transition and Transformation: and certain costs, such as win fees a form of commission, may need to be capitalised and spread over the life of the contract, as opposed to being expensed as incurred.
The impact of these items, individually or in aggregate, may be material to the revenue and profits in any given financial year, however there will be no impact on cash in any given financial year nor is there expected to be any ultimate long-term impact on the cumulative profits of the Group.
The Groups IFRS 15 impact assessment and implementation work remains ongoing, alongside a quantification exercise which is expected to be finalised during the year ending 31 December 2017.
101 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.1.
Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis other than derivative financial instruments, which are stated at fair value.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation.
Adjustments are made on consolidation for differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the material overseas subsidiaries are Euro, US Dollar US$, South African Rand ZAR and Swiss Franc CHF.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date and their Income Statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
In contracts with customers, where more than one good Supply Chain or service Professional Services or Managed Services is provided to the customer, consideration is allocated between Supply Chain, Professional Services and Managed Services using relative fair value principal.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: 2.3.
Supply Chain The Group supplies hardware and software together as goods to customers that is sourced from and delivered by a number of suppliers.
Supply Chain revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
Professional Services The Group provides skilled professionals to customers either on a resource on demand basis where the revenue is billed on a timesheet basis, or operating within a project framework where revenue is recognised with reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs percentage of completion basis of the contract.
Unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
A provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Managed Services The Group sells maintenance, support and management of customers IT infrastructures and operations.
The Group identifies individual revenue generating activities or performance obligations within each contract and allocates revenue between them.
This revenue is then assessed for recognition purposes based on the nature of the activity.
Managed Services revenue is recognised over the term of the contract as services are delivered.
Unearned Managed Services revenue is included within deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one year are deferred and recognised over the relevant period.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate and revenue thereon is measured at the fair value of the consideration received.
The related costs are recognised as they are incurred.
However, a portion of costs incurred in the initial phase of outsourcing contracts transition and or transformation costs may be deferred when they are specific to a given contract and or will generate future economic benefits, and are recoverable.
These costs are allocated to work-in-progress and any reimbursement by the client is recorded as a deduction from the costs incurred.
102 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 On a limited number of Managed Services contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis which is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract see note 3.1.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is restricted to the extent that it is probable that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Bid and set-up costs The Group operates in a highly competitive environment and is frequently involved in contract bids with multiple competitors with the outcome usually unknown until the contract is awarded and signed.
Any bid costs incurred by the Groups Central Bid Management Engines are not capitalised or charged to the contract, but instead directly charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as they are incurred.
These costs associated with bids are not separately identifiable nor can they be measured reliably as the Groups internal bid teams work across multiple bids at any one time.
Further, it cannot be assessed as probable that the contract will be obtained until the tender process has completed and the contract has been awarded.
Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Operating lease income Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the Income Statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Adjusted measures The Group uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group.
These non-GAAP measures comprise of: Adjusted revenue, adjusted Services revenue, adjusted Professional Services revenue, adjusted Supply Chain revenue, and adjusted administrative expenses excludes the revenue and administrative expenses from a disposed subsidiary, RDC, for the comparative reporting year.
Adjusted operating profit or loss, adjusted profit or loss before tax, adjusted tax, adjusted profit or loss for the year, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share are, as appropriate, each stated before: exceptional and other adjusting items including gain or loss on business disposals, amortisation of acquired intangibles, utilisation of deferred tax assets where initial recognition was as an exceptional item or a fair value adjustment on acquisition, and the related tax effect of these exceptional and other adjusting items, as Management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of the Segment or the Group as a whole.
Each of these measures also excludes the results of RDC for the comparative periods.
Additionally, adjusted gross profit or loss and adjusted operating profit or loss includes the interest paid on customer-specific financing CSF which Management considers to be a cost of sale.
A reconciliation between key adjusted and statutory measures is provided on page 46 of the Group Finance Directors Review which details the impact of Exceptional and other adjusted items when comparing to the non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
Further detail is also provided within note 4, Segment Information.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where an asset does not have independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the CGU to which it belongs.
Certain other corporate assets are unable to be allocated against specific CGUs.
These assets are tested across an aggregation of CGUs that utilise the asset.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognised.
The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
As the Group has no assets carried at revalued amounts, such reversal is recognised in the Income Statement.
103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 2.7.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold buildings: 25-50 years Short leasehold improvements: shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Fixtures and fittings Head office: 5-15 years Other: shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Office machinery and computer hardware: 2-15 years Motor vehicles: 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the Income Statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investment property Investment property is defined as land and or buildings held by the Group to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of business or for use in the supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
The Group recognises any part of an owned or leased under a finance lease property that is leased to third parties as investment property, unless it represents an insignificant portion of the property.
Investment property is measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group elects to measure investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any i. e. applying the same accounting policies including useful lives as for property, plant and equipment.
The fair values, which reflect the market conditions as at the balance sheet date, are disclosed in note 14.
Intangible assets Software and software licences Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Currently software is amortised over four years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development Costs that are incurred and that can be specifically attributed to the development phase of management information systems for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are carried initially at fair value.
Following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Existing customer contracts: 5 years Existing customer relationships: 10 years Tools and technology: 7 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the acquisition method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
104 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGU monitored by Management, usually at business Segment level or statutory Company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs associated with the investment.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described in each category below: 2.12.1.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90-day credit terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise deposits held for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit and which are not available to the Group on demand.
Subsequent to initial measurement, current asset investments are measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand, and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in each category below: 2.13.1.
Provisions excluding Restructuring provision Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Customer contract provisions In respect of contracts where revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis, and where the performance of one of these limited number of contracts results in a margin that was less than anticipated at the time that it was agreed, then the future financial performance of that contract will be reviewed in detail.
If, after further financial analysis, the full financial consequence of the contract can be reliably estimated, and it is determined that the contract is potentially loss-making, then the best estimate of the losses expected to be incurred until the end of the contract will be provided for.
The Group has elected to apply IAS 11 in its assessment of whether contracts are considered onerous and in subsequently estimating the provision as IAS 18 considers the requirements of IAS 11 are generally applicable to the recognition of revenue and the associated expenses for a transaction involving the rendering of services.
A contract that is accounted for under IAS 11 that is considered potentially onerous is assessed according to the recognition of expected losses in IAS 11 ahead of the onerous contract guidance in IAS 37 and considers total estimated costs i. e. directly attributable variable costs and fixed allocated costs as included in the assessment of whether the contract is onerous or not and in the measurement of the provision.
Restructuring provisions The Group recognises a restructuring provision when there is a programme planned and controlled by Management that changes materially the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted.
105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Further to the Groups general provision recognition policy, a restructuring provision is only considered when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying, as a minimum: the business or part of the business concerned: the principal locations affected: the location, function and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services: the expenditures that will be undertaken and when the plan will be implemented.
The Group will only recognise a specific restructuring provision once a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
The Group only includes incremental costs associated directly with the restructuring within the restructuring provisions such as employee termination benefits and consulting fees.
The Group specifically excludes from recognition in a restructuring provision any costs associated with ongoing activities such as the costs of training or relocating staff that are redeployed within the business rather than retrenched and costs for employees who continue to be employed in ongoing operations, regardless of the status of these operations post restructure.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no material pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
The Group has an obligation to make a one-off payment to French employees upon retirement, the Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire IFC.
French employment law requires that a company pays employees a one-time contribution when and only when the employee leaves the Company for retirement at the mandatory age.
This is a legal requirement for all businesses who incur the obligation upon departure, due to retirement, of an employee.
Typically the retirement benefit is based on length of service of the employee and his or her salary at retirement.
The amount is set via a legal minimum but the retirement premiums can be improved by the collective agreement or employment contract in some cases.
In Computacenter France, the payment is based on accrued service and ranges from 1 month of salary after 5 years of service to 9.4 months of salary after 47 years of service.
If the employee leaves voluntarily at any point before retirement, all liability is extinguished and any accrued service is not transferred to any new employment.
Management continues to account for this obligation according to IAS 19 revised.
Due to the materiality of the obligation, Management considers no further disclosures are relevant at this time.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations affecting cash flows from forecasted transactions and unrecognised firm commitments.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instruments fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are addressed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting years for which they are designated.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
106 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Cash flow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement in administrative expenses.
Amounts recognised within other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement, within administrative expenses, when the hedged transaction affects the Income Statement, such as when the hedged financial expense is recognised.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the Income Statement within administrative expenses.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised within other comprehensive income remains within other comprehensive income until after the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects the Income Statement.
Any other gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to administrative expenses in the Income Statement.
Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in the future against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the Income Statement.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 29.
In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market-related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share see note 11.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 28.
Fair value measurement The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
107 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed, are summarised in note 26.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of Financial Statements requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
During the year, Management set aside time to consider the critical accounting estimates and judgements for the Group.
This process included reviewing the last reporting periods disclosures and the current periods challenging accounting issues.
Where Management deemed an area of accounting to be no longer a critical estimate or judgement, an explanation for this decision is found in the relevant accounting note to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical estimates Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
The areas involving significant risk resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: 3.1.
Services revenue recognition The Group accounted for certain Services contracts using the percentage of completion method, recognising revenue by reference to the stage of completion of the contract which is determined by actual costs incurred as a proportion of total forecast contract costs.
This method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion of the contract and may involve estimates on the scope of services required for fulfilling the contractually defined obligations.
These significant estimates include total contract costs, total contract revenues, contract risks, including technical risks, and other assumptions.
Under the percentage of completion method, the changes in these estimates and assumptions may lead to an increase or decrease in revenue recognised at the balance sheet date with the in-year revenue recognition appropriately adjusted as required.
When the outcome of the contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that expenses incurred are eligible to be recovered.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration.
The key judgements are the extent to which revenue should be recognised and also, where total contract costs are not covered by total contract revenue, the extent to which an adjustment is required.
Additionally, where contracts are renegotiated mid-life, Management will consider when to make a revenue adjustment.
A major contract was under renegotiation at year end with the terms largely agreed but not yet signed.
Shortly after the balance sheet date, an agreement was signed including settlement of outstanding revenue claims relating to the second half of 2016.
This additional information resulted in an update to the original revenue estimate with an adjustment of 1.7 million made to increase 2016 revenue and margins.
During the year, Management held a number of difficult contracts under review that were considered to be performing below expectation.
The number of contracts under review fluctuated during the year between eight and 12.
Each contract was subject to a detailed review to consider the reasons behind the lower than anticipated performance and the potential accounting impacts related effect on revenue recognition estimates.
For a limited number of these difficult contracts, where there was no immediate operational or commercial remedy for the performance, a range of possible outcomes for the estimate of the total contract costs and total contract revenues was considered to determine the best estimate of stage of completion.
The gross revenue recognised in the year from these contracts under review was approximately 10.4 million.
The range of potential scenarios considered by management in respect of these specific contracts included a reduction in revenue, and margins, recognised in 2016 of 4.1 million, in the year.
Also, based on Managements best estimate, the total cost to complete on these contracts were 26.6 million.
Critical judgements Judgements made by Management in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements, are as follows: 3.2.
Exceptional items Exceptional items remain a core focus of Management with the recent Alternative Performance Measure regulations providing further guidance in this area.
1 Management is required to exercise its judgement in the classification of certain items as exceptional and outside of the Groups adjusted results.
The overall goal of Management is to present the Groups underlying performance without distortion from one-off or non-trading events regardless of whether they be favourable or unfavourable to the underlying result.
108 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 To achieve this, Management have considered the materiality, infrequency and nature of the various items classified as exceptional this year against the requirements and guidance provided by IAS 1, our Group accounting policies and the recent regulatory interpretations and guidance.
In reaching their conclusions, Management consider not only the effect on the overall underlying Group performance but also where an item is critical in understanding the performance of one of its component Segments which is of relevance to investors and analysts when assessing the Group result and its future prospects as a whole.
Further details of the individual exceptional items, and the reasons for their disclosure treatment, are set out in note 6.
Change in critical estimates and critical judgements During the year, Management reassessed the critical estimates and critical judgements and resolved that the following were no longer considered critical.
Critical estimates Provisions The Groups provisions principally relate to obligations arising from onerous lease property provisions, customer contract provisions, restructuring provisions and retirement benefit obligations.
Management has considered each element that makes up the total provision balance as at the year end and decided that assumptions used to estimate these elements of provisions were not sensitive enough to change the provision balance materially hence provisions are no longer considered a critical estimate.
Further details of the specific estimates used in arriving at these provisions are provided in note 25.
Providing for doubtful debts The level of provision for doubtful debts has decreased significantly from previous years and hence is no longer a critical estimate as the range of possible outcomes resulting from various assumptions applied by management are now not considered material.
This was previously considered a critical estimate due to the higher than normal trade receivables balances in our French Segment at 31 December 2014.
Critical judgements Asset held for sale At the time of approving the 2014 year end Annual Report and Accounts, Management made a judgement in deciding that the sale of its subsidiary, RDC, should not be accounted for as an asset held for sale under the Groups relevant accounting policy disclosed at the time.
However, the Group did not carry any assets classified as held for sale or have any discontinued operations as at 31 December 2016 therefore this is no longer considered an area of critical judgement by Management.
109 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 4 SEGMENT INFORMATION For Management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical Segments, with each Segment determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
No operating Segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating Segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its geographical Segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource 1 allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss which is measured differently from statutory operating profit or loss in the Consolidated Financial Statements as defined above.
Segmental performance for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 was as follows: Year ended 31 December 2016 UK Germany France Belgium Total 000 000 000 000 000 Revenue 1 Adjusted Supply Chain

113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 5 GROUP OPERATING PROFIT This is stated after charging crediting : 2016 2015 000 000 Auditors remuneration: Audit of the Financial Statements 44 43 Audit of subsidiaries 493 428 Total audit fees 537 471 Audit related assurance services 56 67 Taxation compliance services 29 44 Other assurance services 9 54 Taxation advisory services 144 124 Total non-audit services 238 289 Total fees 775 760 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 15,631 18,885 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 168 387 Depreciation of investment property 227 227 Amortisation of software 12,413 11,758 Loss on disposal of software 25 9 Amortisation of other intangible assets 784 1,553 Net foreign currency differences 847 741 Costs of inventories recognised as an expense 1,973,490 1,850,619 Operating lease payments 26,942 32,221 6 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 2016 2015 000 000 Operating profit Redundancy and other restructuring costs 1,169 1,465 Onerous contracts 436 Gain on reversal of fair value adjustments 3,045 1,876 1,029 Exceptional loss gain on disposal of a subsidiary 522 42,155 Exceptional items before taxation 1,354 41,126 Income tax Tax on onerous contracts included in operating profit 52 Tax on gain on reversal of fair value adjustments 192 Exceptional items after taxation 1,162 41,074 2016: Included within the current year are the following exceptional items: As outlined in our 2016 Interim Report, a Line of Business restructure was agreed with the business in France.
This initiative to reduce the underutilised resources within our Professional Services arm completed in the second half of 2016, for a cost of 1.0 million.
This restructure has seen France exit the direct provision of Group Field Maintenance Services.
This Line of Business had materially decreased over time, leading to significant resourcing overcapacity.
Any residual customer requirement will be sub-contracted to an existing third party provider.
Additionally, as also detailed in the 2016 Interim Report, further provisioning to the existing 2014 Social Plan in France of 0.1 million was also required during the period.
The most significant item within exceptional items during 2016 was the 3.0 million release of historical fair value adjustments made on the 2009 acquisition of becom Informationssysteme GmbH becom.
This followed the final payment of the contingent consideration to the vendor during 2016.
Due to the materiality and nature of the item, Management decided to classify this one-off gain as exceptional.
During the third quarter, a Group subsidiary domiciled in Luxembourg, Computacenter PSF SA, was disposed of for a net loss of 0.5 million.
As the principal item in the year to 31 December 2015 was the gain on the disposal of a Group subsidiary, R. D. Trading Limited RDC, of 42.2 million, the current year loss on disposal activity has also been classified as exceptional.
114 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 2015: Included within the prior year are the following exceptional items: Computacenter UK Limited disposed of its wholly-owned subsidiary RDC during the year.
An exceptional gain of 42.2 million was recognised on the disposal.
In line with our accounting policy, Management has elected under IAS 1 to report this gain as a separate line item on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement due to the materiality, infrequency and nature of this gain.
As noted within the summary 1 of significant accounting policies the adjusted results exclude this gain.
This election provides the best guidance to users of our external reporting as to the underlying profitability trends within the Group and to present the results of the Group in a way that is fair, balanced and understandable.
Computacenter France continued with its substantial restructuring exercise that began in 2014.
An additional cost of 1.5 million has been recognised as part of the Social Plan.
As the redundancy and restructuring costs were treated as an exceptional item on recognition, the further provision has also been treated as an exceptional item.
Within this balance, Management has provided for legal expenses of 0.4 million directly related to individual legal challenges to termination settlements provided under the Social Plan.
The Groups remaining two onerous contracts continue to show operational improvements therefore Management has revised its estimates of the losses to be incurred.
On this basis, the Group has released 0.4 million of the provision.
As the onerous contracts were treated as an exceptional item on recognition, the write-back of the provision has also been released as an exceptional item.

In addition, at 31 December 2016, there were unused tax losses across the Group of 150.8 million 2015: 130.9 million for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Of these losses, 40.4 million 2015: 33.5 million arise in Germany and 110.4 million 2015: 93.3 million arise in France.
A significant proportion of the losses arising in Germany have been generated in statutory entities that no longer have significant levels of trade.
The remaining unrecognised tax losses relate to other loss-making overseas subsidiaries.

e Impact of rate change The main rate of UK Corporation will be reduced to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and 17 per cent from 1 April 2020, as enacted in the Finance Act 2015.
The deferred tax in these Financial Statements reflects this.
11 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year excluding own shares held.
To calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.

To calculate this, cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by Senior Management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent 2015: between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all CGUs for 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash flow projections ranges from 11.0 to 15.0 per cent 2015: 11.0 to 15.0 per cent which represents the Groups pre-tax discount rate adjusted for the risk profiles of the individual CGUs.
Each CGU generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.
Other non-current assets When there is an indication of impairment within a CGU, the carrying value of the non-current assets are compared to their recoverable amount which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs of disposal or the value-in-use of the CGU calculated as described above.
In France, a shortfall from the financial budgets approved by Management, or adverse changes in the assumptions, such as a 0.5 per cent reduction in market growth rate or an increase in the discount rate of 0.5 per cent would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.

Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
Due to strong cash generation over the past three years, the Group is now in a position where it can finance its requirements from its cash balance.
The Group does, however, retain overdraft facilities where required.
The uncommitted overdraft facilities available to the Group are 12.8 million at 31 December 2016 2015: 13.7 million.
During 2013 the Group entered into a specific committed facility of 40.0 million for a three-year term which was due to expire in May 2016.
In February 2015 this facility was extended at the same value through to February 2018.
At 31 December 2016 the facility was not utilised.
For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following at 31 December: 2016 2015 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 118,676 111,770 Bank overdrafts note 22 90 118,676 111,680 21 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 2016 2015 000 000 Trade payables 482,639 392,757 Other payables 196,899 189,098 679,538 581,855 124 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 For terms and conditions relating to related parties, refer to note 33.

Bank overdrafts The bank overdrafts are unsecured and are subject to annual review.
Finance leases The finance leases are only secured on the assets that they finance.
These assets are in the main used to satisfy specific customer contracts.
There are a small number of assets that are utilised internally.
Other loans The other loans are unsecured borrowings to finance equipment sold to customers on specific contracts or for equipment for own use.
Other loans comprise the following: Maturity date Interest rate 000 31 December 2016 2017 1.75% 6.67% 413 Less: current instalments due on other loans 413 Maturity date Interest rate 000 31 December 2015 2016 1.75% 6.67% 1,514 Less: current instalments due on other loans 1,514 The table below summarises the maturity profile of these loans: 2016 2015 000 000 No later than one year 413 1,514 413 1,514 The finance lease and loan facilities are committed.

125 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 23 FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS 2016 2015 000 000 Financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss Foreign exchange forward contracts 1,561 358 Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange forward contracts 6,293 940 7,854 1,298 Cash flow hedges Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income These amounts reflect the change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges which are used to hedge expected contract costs in South African Rand and Hungarian Forint where sales on those contracts are in Sterling, based on highly probable forecast transactions.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss The Group also enters into other foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to reduce the foreign exchange risk of expected sales and purchases.
When these other contracts are not designated in hedge relationships they are measured at fair value through profit and loss within administrative expenses.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency costs and changes in the foreign exchange forward rates.
Effectiveness of hedging The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated for the expected highly probable forecast transactions to which hedge accounting has been applied.
No significant element of hedge ineffectiveness required recognition in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted costs were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised gain of 6,293,000 2015: 940,000 with a deferred tax liability of 1,070,000 2015: 190,000 relating to the hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

As one of the three contracts initially provided for ceased during the final quarter of 2015, only two remain provided for at 31 December 2016.
The originally contracted periods for both of these contracts were due to complete during 2016, however both have now been extended, on terms that are more favourable than before.
Whilst there continues to be uncertainty around the future performance of these contracts and the exact timing of cash flows, this uncertainty continues to decrease due to the Groups experience in running these particular, now mature, contracts.
Management remains comfortable with the level of the provision.
Property provisions Assumptions used to calculate the property provisions are based on 100 per cent of the market value of the rental charges plus any contractual dilapidation expenses on empty properties and the Directors best estimates of the likely time before the relevant leases can be reassigned or sub-let, which ranges between one and 15 years.
The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at a rate based upon the Bank of England base rate.
Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
Other provisions The Group has a provision against the retirement benefit obligations in France under the Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire IFC as described in note 2.13.3.
Economic outflows under the obligation only occur if eligible employees reach the statutory retirement age whilst still in employment.
The Group made 37,000 of payments during 2016 under this obligation 2015: nil.
In estimating the provision required, Management is required to make a number of assumptions.
The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows, the turnover rate of employed personnel and rate of salary increases over the length of their projected employment.
The level of unrealised actuarial gains or losses are sensitive to changes in the discount rate, which is affected by market conditions and therefore subject to variation.
Management makes use of an independent actuarial valuation in reaching its conclusions.
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2016 in respect of the Groups French retirement benefit obligations under the IFC was 4.7 million 2015: 3.3 million.
Key movements during the year include a charge to the Income Statement of 0.4 million for the service cost and an actuarial loss taken through reserves of 0.5 million.
The actuarial loss primarily related to a reduction in the iBoxx Corporate AA 10y index discount rate from 2.0 per cent at 31 December 2015 to 1.3 per cent at 31 December 2016.
127 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 25 PROVISIONS CONTINUED Also included within other provisions are the residual estimated costs associated with elements of the comprehensive transformation of the Groups French business that occurred in 2014 for 0.7 million and the Line of Business restructure that occurred during 2016 for 0.2 million.
The remaining nature of the costs previously provided for primarily include retraining and resettlement costs for redundant employees are expected to be utilised in 2017.
The 1.1 million of costs provided for during the first half of the year represent the last expected tranche of assistance costs to former employees for the 2014 restructure of 0.1 million and the cost of the Line of Business restructure for 1.0 million.
The 2014 transformation provision was based inter alia on assumptions concerning the duration of individual settlement payment programmes and the uptake of retraining and resettlement packages.
As disclosed last year, there remains some residual uncertainty relating to individual legal challenges to the implementation of the Social Plan.
These uncertainties arise both from technical arguments around whether the Social Plan process followed was procedurally correct and had pre-existing approval from the multiple, potentially interested, regulatory authorities and also from a challenge as to whether Computacenter France was damaging to the overall Group competitiveness and economic performance.
Having taken independent legal advice on this matter Management has applied judgements which it considers reasonable in establishing the required provision.
Management retains a provision, within the amount disclosed above, for legal expenses of 0.3 million directly related to these individual legal challenges to termination settlements provided under the Social Plan.
26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 45 to 53. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, current asset investment and forward currency contracts, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
The Group manages its counterparty credit risk by placing cash on deposit across a panel of reputable banking institutions, with no more than 50.0 million deposited at any one time except for UK Government-backed counterparties where the limit is 70.0 million.
Aside from the counterparty risk above, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, cash and short-term deposits and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, existing committed and uncommitted facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
If long-term borrowings were to be utilised in the future, the Groups policy would be to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Effect on profit Change in before tax basis points 000 2016 Sterling 25 117 Euro 25 247 US Dollars 25 8 2015 Sterling 25 146 Euro 25 138 US Dollars 25 33 The impact of a reasonable possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other financial instruments carried within the Consolidated Financial Statements is not materially different from their carrying amount.
128 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2016 the Group held foreign exchange contracts as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical Segments are denominated in the functional currency of that Segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a net asset of 7,854,000 2015: 1,298,000.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profit before tax or equity.
129 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2016 Financial liabilities 856 1,659 1,934 4,449 Derivative financial instruments 181 92 273 Trade and other payables 679,538 679,538 680,575 1,751 1,934 684,260 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2015 Financial liabilities 90 1,583 2,340 2,171 6,184 Derivative financial instruments 574 338 10 922 Trade and other payables 581,855 581,855 90 584,012 2,678 2,181 588,961 Fair value measurements recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Derivative financial instruments forward currency contracts At 31 December 2016 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of a net asset of 7,854,000 2015: 1,298,000.
The realised gains from forward currency contracts in the year to 31 December 2016 of 940,000 2015: 747,000, are offset by broadly equivalent realised losses on the related underlying transactions.
27 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the Companys Dividend Policy is to maintain a dividend cover of between 1 2 to 2.5 times.
In 2016 the cover was 2.4 times, on an adjusted profit basis 2015: 2.5 times.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements.
The Group seeks to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow.
As a consequence, the UK has sourced an increasing proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates.
Each country finances its own working capital requirements, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.
During 2013, a notional cash pooling arrangement was introduced, which is still in place, which Group companies can access and allows the Group to pool its funds.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they 3 finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this CSF are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes 3 this CSF when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues.
These financing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
In certain circumstances, the Group deposits its funds in short-term investments that do not fulfil the criteria to be classified as cash and cash 3 equivalents.
The Group considers these deposits when managing the net funds of the business, and accordingly includes these deposits within 3 net funds excluding CSF.
130 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 3 Capital, defined as net funds, that the Group monitors is: 2016 2015 000 000 3 Net funds excluding CSF 148,382 126,675 CSF 3,890 5,887 3 Net funds 144,492 120,788 Each operating country manages its working capital in line with Group policies.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an account manager and account director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had available 12.8 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2015: 13.7 million.

Issued under the terms of the Computacenter Performance Share Plan 2006, as amended at the AGM held on 13 May 2011.
One-quarter of the shares will vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 5 per cent per annum.
One-half of the shares will vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 7.5 per cent and will vest in full if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 10 per cent.
If the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period is between 5 and 10 per cent, shares awarded will vest on a straight-line basis.
The performance period usually covers a period of three years from 1 January of the year the award is granted.
A limited number of PSP awards are granted with a performance period of two years.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the recent historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
