In the transition to FRS101 the Company has made no measurement and recognition adjustments.
In these financial statements the Company has applied the exemption available under FRS101 in respect of the following disclosures: a cash flow statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: and the impact of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
As the consolidated accounts of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemption available under FRS 1010 in respect of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments disclosures of group settled share based payments.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is not required to present its own profit and loss account.
The Companys profit for the period was 127.3m 2015: loss of 45.2m.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt he reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS 101 IFRS balance sheet at 3 August 2014 for the purposes of the transition to FRS 101.
Going concern The Company heads a group which is highly cash generative, with sufficient medium and long term facilities in place to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The directors are therefore satisfied that the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have therefore continued to prepare the Companys financial statements on the going concern basis.
Investments Investments are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment.
Amounts due from and to group companies Amounts receivable from or payable to other companies within the Companys group are recognised initially and fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts if assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Share based payments Awards options or conditional shares granted by the Company over its own shares to the employees of subsidiary companies are recognised in the Companys own financial statements as an increase in the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
The amount recognised is equivalent to the equity-settled share based payment charge recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
The corresponding credit is recognised directly in equity.
Treasury shares Where the Company purchases the Companys equity share capital into treasury treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
