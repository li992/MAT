The use of these alternative performance measures are consistent with those used by sell-side equity analysts who write research on the Group and how institutional investors consider the performance of the Group.
Facility EBITDA was the measure used under the Groups $420m Revolving Credit Facility to determine the Net Debt to Facility EBITDA covenant calculation.
Whilst the $420m facility was repaid and cancelled as part of the refinancing on the acquisition of TAG, for consistency the directors will continue to use the metric Net Debt to Facility EBITDA.

A deferred tax debit of $1.7m 2015: $1.3m credit has been recognized in the consolidated statement of changes in equity in the year in relation to the defined benefit pension schemes.
The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20.0% 2015: 20.9%.

The Group realized benefits in relation to intra-Group financing of $14.4m 2015: $9.2m.
The benefits mostly relate to arrangements put inplace part-way through the prior year to facilitate the acquisition of TAG.
Benefits from the UK patent box regime amounted to $7.6m 2015: $6.0m current and $4.8m prior year benefit.
US R&D tax credit incentives of $1.8m 2015: $0.8m reflect the inclusion of a full year of results of TAG.
The net effect of movements in deferred tax not recognized of $0.8m 2015: $9.0m is significantly lower than the previous year, whichincluded the impact of the one-off recognition of tax credits in the US following the acquisition of TAG.
116 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial Company financial Additional information statements and notes statements and notes Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 6 Taxation continued The Group realized a net credit in relation to the true-up of prior year current and deferred tax estimates of $4.6m 2015: $9.2m.
There was a significant movement in current tax of $20.6m partially offset by a movement in deferred tax of $16.0m, mainly in the US, as a result of the Group being able to utilize significantly higher deferred tax assets losses and tax credits against prior year current federal and state tax liabilities than previously anticipated.
The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year is analysed in note 28.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK has been reduced from 20% currently to 19% from 1April 2017 and 18% from 1April 2020.
This has reduced the tax charge in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by $0.8m.
This reflects the net impact of the re-measurement of deferred tax balances, in particular liabilities relating to intangibles.
There was also a $0.5m debit to equity in relation tothe share options deferred tax asset.
The further cut in the rate from 1 April 2020 from 18% to 17%, announced in the 2016 Budget, hasnot yet been substantively enacted and has therefore not been taken into account.

Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The hindsight period adjustments relate to transactions that occurred within 12 months of the acquisition date and are attributable to TAG acquired during the year ended 30 April 2015 note 39.
The additions to goodwill in the year relate to the acquisition of Authasas BV and hindsight period adjustments for the TAG acquisition note 39.
Of the additions to goodwill, there is no amount that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash-generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has two CGUs being the two Product Portfolio groups: Micro Focus and SUSE.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount: where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30April each year.
The recoverable amounts of the two CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether ornot the goodwill of the two CGUs has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
The cash flow projections in the three following financial years reflect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects inthe CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
118 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial Company financial Additional information statements and notes statements and notes Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 9 Goodwill continued Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to the two CGUs represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the consolidated statement of financial position date and risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rates applied to both CGUs are considered tobe the same at 11.6%.
During the previous financial year the Group was run differently than from today and the prior year geographic discount rates are summarized below: 2015 North America 14% International 11% Asia Pacific and Japan 13% Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The VIU calculations are based on five years projections and then a terminal value calculation.
The long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be 2% for the Micro Focus CGU and 10% for the SUSE CGU.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2015: $nil.
As the VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating margin, the directors are of the opinion that it would takeasystematic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where impairment would be required.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE in the absolute value of long-term operating marginswould be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is flexible andcould quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more significant changes.
If the long-term margins used in the VIU calculations forallCGUswere4.0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would nothaveanyimpairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not .
The Group based its estimate for the long-term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC and using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The directors have assessed that a 2.0% 2015:2.0% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible and this wouldrepresent a 27.5% 2015: 17.7% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cashflowsof all of thetwo CGUs were 2.0% 2015: 2.0% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimates, the Group wouldnot have any impairment charge.
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that 0% for Micro Focus and 5.0% for SUSE change is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 0% for Micro Focus and5% for SUSElower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognized any goodwill impairment charge.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across the two CGUs combined with areasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA for each of the two CGUs is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past Adjusted EBITDA margins are not indicative of future Adjusted EBITDA margins.
The long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins applied to the Micro Focus CGU is 55% and the SUSE CGU is 32%.
The long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed to be 2.0% for Micro Focus and 10.0% for SUSE.
The Authasas business has been integrated into the Micro Focus CGU when acquired on 17 July 2015 and the Serena acquisition will beintegrated into the Micro Focus CGU from the acquisition date of 2 May 2016.
The Serena acquisition has not been included in any impairment review since it was acquired after the end of the financial year.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected usefuleconomic life see Group accounting policy H d. Expenditure totaling $34.5m 2015: $21.2m was made in the year, including $31.4m in respect of development costs and $3.1m of purchased software.
The acquisition of Authasas BV gives rise to an addition of $3.4m to purchased intangibles note 39.
Of the $31.4m of additions to development costs, $30.9m 2015: $19.5m relates to internal development costs and $0.5m 2015: $nil to external consultants development costs.
At 30 April 2016, the unamortized lives of technology assets were in the range of two to six years, customer relationships in the range ofone to seven years and trade names in the range of 10 to 20 years.
Amortization of $106.7m 2015: $51.2m is included in selling and distribution costs, $94.7m 2015: $55.7m is included in research and development expense and $1.9m 2015: $2.2m is included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The Group considers the credit quality of trade and other receivables on a customer by customer basis.
The Group considers that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets.
This is considered to be the case asthere is a low risk of default due to the high number of recurring customers and credit control policies.
In determining the recoverability of a tradereceivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30April 2016 and 2015, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2016, trade receivables of $28.8m 2015: $34.1m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 20 days in excess of due date 2015: 19 days.

Following a recalculation of the impact of temporary differences, including the offset of brought forward deferred tax assets, the respective tax liabilities are now expected to be significantly lower than previously anticipated.
Current tax liabilities 2016 2015 $000 $000 Corporation tax 22,426 67,895 The reduction in current tax liabilities is mainly due to, firstly, a $24.5m payment made in relation to a UK tax claim following receipt of anAccelerated Payment notice from HMRC and, secondly, a reduction in US current tax liabilities as a result of the offset of deferred tax assets in the prior year note 6.
During the year ended 30 April 2016, the Group accrued interest on tax provisions of $0.5m 2015: $2.6m.

The provision was increased by $7.7m due to a lengthening in the estimated time to sublease certain properties and reduced by $1.8m due to the shortening in the estimated time to sublease two properties.
Restructuring and integration provisions relate mostly to severance and integration work undertaken during the year ended 30 April 2016.
Integration provisions arose from the work done in bringing together the Base Micro Focus and TAG organizations into one organization.
Severance releases relate to the change in estimates made for integrating the TAG business in the year ended 30 April 2015, including the redeployment of staff previously notified of redundancy.
The provisions are expected to be fully utilized within 12 months.
Legal provisions include managements best estimate of the likely outflow of economic benefits associated with on-going legal matters.
Other provisions include primarily: Potential liabilities acquired with the Iona acquisition of $nil as no longer required 2015: $3.8m : $0.2m relating to tax due for pension and bonus payments prior to July 2011 for a subsidiary in Brazil 2015: $0.6m : Provision that was inherited relating to potential software licencing issues of $nil as no longer required 2015: $3.0m : and $1.0m remaining provision for potential customer claims 2015: $3.2m.

130 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial Company financial Additional information statements and notes statements and notes Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 25 Pension commitments a Defined contribution The Group has established a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal funds are those in the US, UK and Germany.
These were funded schemes of the defined contribution type.
Outside of these territories, the schemes are also of the defined contribution type, except for France and Japan which is a defined benefit scheme, but which has few members and therefore is not significant to the Group.
Pension costs for defined contributions schemes are as follows: 2016 2015 $000 $000 Defined contribution schemes note 35 12,848 9,815 b Defined benefit 2016 2015 $000 $000 Within non-current assets: Long-term pension assets 22,272 14,076 Within non-current liabilities: Retirement benefit obligations 31,669 32,742 There are three defined benefit plans in Germany under broadly similar regulatory frameworks.
All of the plans are final salary pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life in the case of retirement, disability and death.
The level of benefits provided depends not only on the final salary but also on members length of service, social security ceiling and other factors.
Final pension entitlements are calculated by our Actuary in Swiss Life.
They also complete calculations for cases of death in service and disability.
There is no requirement for the appointment of Trustees in Germany.
The schemes are administered locally with the assistance of German pension experts.
All three plans were closed for new membership.
Long-term pension assets Certain long-term pension assets do not meet the definition of plan assets as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Group.
Such assets as follows are recorded separately in the consolidated statement of financial position as long-term pension assets.
The movement on the long-term pension asset is as follows: 2016 2015 $000 $000 As at 1 May 14,076 Acquisition of TAG note 39 15,472 Hindsight adjustment note 39 3,917 Return on non-plan assets 333 Benefits paid 8 Contributions 475 Actuarial gain on non-plan assets included within other comprehensive income 3,104 Foreign currency exchange changes 375 1,396 As at 30 April 22,272 14,076 The long-term pension asset was acquired as part of the acquisition of TAG.
The non-plan assets were not subject to an actuarial revaluation until after 30 April 2015 and therefore a hindsight adjustment has been made in respect of this and reflected in this years consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
131 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2016 continued 25 Pension commitments continued Retirement benefit obligations The following amounts have been included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the German defined benefit pension arrangements: 2016 2015 $000 $000 Current service charge 760 330 Charge to operating profit 760 330 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 546 320 Interest on pension scheme assets 79 59 Charge to finance costs 467 261 Total charge to consolidated statement of comprehensive income 1,227 591 The contributions for the year ending 30 April 2017 are expected to be broadly in line with the current year.
The following amounts have been recognized as movements in equity: 2016 2015 $000 $000 Actuarial return on assets excluding amounts included in interest income 108 229 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities: Demographic Financial 2,024 4,565 Experience 565 140 2,589 4,425 Exchange rate movement Movement in the year 2,697 4,196 The key assumptions used for the German scheme were: 2016 2015 Rate of increase in final pensionable salary 2.60% 2.60% Rate of increase in pension payments 2.00% 2.00% Discount rate 1.70% 1.45% Inflation 2.00% 2.00% The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the German scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to market conditions.
If the discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligation would be expected to increase by $4.8m 2015: $5.2m and if it was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to decrease by $4.1m 2015: $4.4m.
If the inflation assumption was 0.25% lower, the obligations would be expected to decrease by $1.3m 2015: $1.4m and if it was 0.25% higher, they would be expected to increase by $1.4m 2015: $1.4m.
The mortality assumptions for the German scheme are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in the territory, specifically German pension table Richttafeln 2005 G by Prof. Dr Klaus Heubeck.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65: 2016 2015 Retiring at age 65 at the end of the reporting year: Male 19 19 Female 23 23 Retiring 15 years after the end of the reporting year: Male 19 19 Female 24 24 132 Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Consolidated financial Company financial Additional information statements and notes statements and notes Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 25 Pension commitments continued The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the German Schemes are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption.
If there was an increase of one year to this assumption the obligation would be expected to increase by $1.1m 2.9% 2015: $1.1m, 2.9%.
The net liability included in the consolidated statement of financial position arising from obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes is as follows: 2016 2015 $000 $000 Present value of funded obligations 37,524 38,224 Fair value of plan assets 5,855 5,482 31,669 32,742 The retirement benefit obligation has moved as follows: 2016 2015 Defined Retirement Defined Retirement benefit Scheme benefit benefit Scheme benefit obligations assets obligations obligations assets obligations $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 At 1 May 38,224 5,482 32,742 Acquisition of TAG 37,128 5,871 31,257 Current service cost 760 760 330 330 Benefits paid 100 84 16 68 16 52 Contributions by plan participants 126 126 81 81 Interest cost income 546 79 467 320 59 261 Remeasurements actuarial losses: Demographic Financial 2,024 2,024 4,565 4,565 Experience 565 565 140 140 Actuarial return on assets excluding amounts includedin interest income 108 108 229 229 Other transfer to non-plan assets 128 128 Foreign currency exchange changes 683 144 539 3,911 614 3,297 At 30 April 37,524 5,855 31,669 38,224 5,482 32,742 None of the plan assets are represented by financial instruments of the Group.
None of the plan assets are occupied or used by the Group.
The plan assets comprise of re-insurance with guaranteed interest rates.
The majority of the plan assets have guaranteed interest rates of 4.0%, with the remaining at 3.25% or 2.75%.
Through its defined benefit schemes the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the pledged and unpledged re-insurance holdings.
Inflation Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
There is acapon the level of inflationary increase on one of the plans which protects the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the planassets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plan obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy willresult in an increase in the plan liabilities.
In the case of the defined benefit plans, the Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset liability matching ALM that has been developed by the Company to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations underthe pension schemes.
In addition to the plan assets outlined above, the Company had re-insurance assets valued at $22.3m at30April 2016 2015: $14.1m.
These assets are designated to fund the pension obligation and do not qualify as plan assets as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Company.
Within this framework the Companys objective isto match assets to the pension obligations by investing in re-insurances that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in theappropriate currency.

The table shows the impact of changes to each assumption in isolation, although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or compound the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation.
These sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as used for the main calculations.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 25 years.
Change in defined Change in benefit assumption obligation Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.50% 11.0% Price inflation 0.25% 3.6% Salary growth rate 0.50% 1.7% An increase of one year in the assumed life expectancy for both males and females would increase the defined benefit obligation by 2.9% 2015: 2.9%.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to previous years.

Foreign exchange risk The Groups currency exposures comprise those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as well as gains and losses on consolidation which go to reserves.
Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involvedand the Groups investment in net assets in currencies other than US$.
Note 3 shows the impact on the consolidated  income of foreign exchange gains in the year 2015: gain.

30 Return of Value to shareholders There has not been a Return of Value to shareholders in the year ended 30 April 2016.
In December 2014 the Company completed a Return of Value to shareholders amounting to 83.9m $131.6m in cash 60 pence per share, equivalent to 94.02 cents per share, by way of a B and C share scheme, which gave shareholders other than certain overseas shareholders a choice between receiving the cash in the form of income or capital.
The Return of Value was accompanied by a 0.9285 share consolidation to maintain broad comparability of the share price and return per share of the ordinary shares before and after the creation of the B and C shares.
This was the Groups 4th Return of Value to shareholders.
Since 25 March 2011 the Company has returned a total of 625.1m to shareholders through share buy-backs, Returns of Value and ordinary dividends which represented 98.4% of the Market Capitalization atthat time.
As part of the corporate entity restructuring resulting from the acquisition a merger reserve was created of approximately $1.4bn, which isexpected to become a distributable reserve in future periods.
This creates flexibility for future Returns of Value once Net Debt to Facility EBITDA is below 2.5 times.

This increase in share capital created a merger reserve deficit of $27.1m.
2 I n January 2012 a Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $129.0m in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $0.6m.
As a result of this a capital redemption reserve was created following the redemption of the B shares.
In November 2012 a further Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $128.2m in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $2.4m.
In the year ended 30 April 2014 a further $47.1m was added to the capital redemption reserve following the redemption of the B shares.
3 O n 20 November 2014 the TAG acquisition was completed note 39.
As a result of this a merger reserve was created of $1.372.7m.
The acquisition of TAG was structured by way of a share for share exchange: this transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 merger relief such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued.
The Company chose to record its investment in TAG at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable i. e. equal to the difference between the fair value of TAGand the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued.
This merger reserve was initially considered unrealized on the basis it was represented by the investment in TAG, which is not considered to represent qualifying consideration in accordance with Tech 02 10 Guidance on the determination of realized profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006.
Immediately following the acquisition of TAG, the Companys investment in TAG was transferred to another Group company in exchange for an intercompany loan.
To the extent this loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized.
4 T he merger reserve is an unrealized profit until it can be realized by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.
$180.0m of the intercompany loanisexpected to be settled in qualifying consideration during the year to 30 April 2017 2015: $130.0m and as such an equivalent proportion of the merger reserve is consideredrealized and therefore has been transferred to the profit and loss account.
5 I n December 2014 a Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $131.6m in cash note 30.
The Return of Value was accompanied by a 0.9285 share consolidation and resulted in a net $11.9m reduction in share capital and an $11.9m increase in the capital redemption reserve.
In addition $47.5m was transferred from themerger reserve to the capital redemption reserve.

a Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which point 25% of awards will vest, 60% ofshares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus15% per annum.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a combination of both.
Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum 25% of awards will vest, with full vesting achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum.
Where the award is subject to ASR, the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
