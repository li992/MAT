A. in Brazil from a Group company whose functional currency was not the Brazilian real.
As the funding was considered to be permanent, no foreign exchange volatility was recognised within financing fair value remeasurements in the Group income statement.
In November 2014, the funding was partially repaid.
The Group exchanged the repayment into US dollars and used it to repay debt.
Following the partial repayment of the debt, the remaining funding was no longer regarded as permanent for the purposes of EU-IFRS.
As a result of the 25% weakening in the Brazilian real against the US dollar between then and 31 March 2015, a charge of US$86m was recognised within financing fair value remeasurements in the year then ended note 14 c. As a result of the further weakening of 11% in the Brazilian real against the US dollar in the year ended 31 March 2016, a charge of US$33m has been recognised within financing fair value remeasurements in that year note 14 c. The Group is similarly exposed to the impact of the Brazilian real strengthening or weakening against the US dollar in the future.
A movement of 23% would result in a US$68m impact on profit before tax.
There is no effect on total equity as a result of this exposure, since it arises on intra-Group funding and there would be a related equal and opposite foreign exchange movement recognised in the translation reserve within equity.
On the basis of the profile of foreign exchange exposures, and an assessment of reasonably possible changes in such exposures, there are no other material sensitivities to foreign exchange risk at the balance sheet dates.
In making these assessments, actual data on movements in the principal currencies over the most recent three-year period has been considered together with exposures at the balance sheet dates.
This methodology has been applied consistently.
