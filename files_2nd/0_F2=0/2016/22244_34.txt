These measures are chosen as they provide additional useful information on business performance and underlying trends.
They are also used to measure the Groups performance against its strategic financial framework.
They are not however, defined terms under IFRS and may not be comparable withsimilarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Where possible they have been reconciled to the statutory equivalents from the primary statements Group Income Statement I S, Group Balance Sheet B S, Group Cash Flow Statement C F or the notes totheconsolidated Group Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings and adjusted operating cash flow have been defined and reconciled separately in notes 2, 4and 10 to the consolidated Group Financial Statements where further explanation of the measures is given.
Additional performance measures are used to help explain the performance of the Group and these are defined and reconciled below.
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow Adjusted operating cash flow is the key metric used to assess the cash generating performance of the Group.
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow makes further adjustments for foreign exchange and the commodity price movements that most impact the Group, which are outside its control, along with other material one-off items, to provide a comparable year on year measure of cash generation that more closely reflects business performance.

ii The foreign exchange movement has been calculated by applying the average 2016 rate to the 2015 adjusted operating cash flow net of taxation of entities with functional currencies other than GBP.
Underlying adjusted operating cash flow is adjusted operating cash flow as defined in note 2 and reconciled in note 4 f. It has been adjusted for the impacts of commodity price movements on E&P and nuclear assets and foreign exchange movements.
It has also been adjusted for one-off working capital movements in UK Business.
This follows billing performance issues after the implementation of anewsystem in 2014, impacting the Groups ability to collect cash from customers and therefore its adjusted operating cash flow.
As a consequence, the working capital movement for UK Business has been removed from underlying adjusted operating cash flow.
E&P free cash flow Free cash flow is used as an additional cash flow metric for the E&P business due to its asset intensive nature.
This metric provides ameasure of the cash generating performance of the E&P business, taking account of its investment activity.
