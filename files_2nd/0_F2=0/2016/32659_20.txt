2 Act 2015 introduced a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% from April 2017 and from 19% to 18% from April 2020.
These reductions were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.

This was substantively enacted on 06 September 2016.
The deferred tax provision at the balance sheet date has been calculated at this rate, resulting in a 0.3m tax credit.

Diluted earnings per share information is based on adjusting the weighted average number of shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share in respect of notional share awards made to employees in regards of share option schemes and the shares held by the employee benefit trust.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.

10 Intangible assets 000 Cost and carrying amount At 29 December 2015, 27 December 2015 and 1 January 2017 26,433 Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to an impairment review annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to its carrying value.
The intangible assets reported on the balance sheet represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub restaurants.
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.6% 2015: 8.1% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately with the sensitivities summarised as follows: An increase in the discount rate of 1% A decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in forecast cash flows.

In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal vesting date.
The Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 28 February 2013 became exercisable on 28 February 2016.
The performance criteria was based on total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was ranked between the median and upper quartile against its comparator group and consequently, 85% the TSR element of the award vested.
In respect of the EPS element of the award, the growth in EPS was above RPI 10% p. a. and 100% of this part of the award vested.
For those awards granted on 27 February 2014 that vest in 2017, the performance criteria were based on TSR and EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was ranked in the lower quartile against its comparator group and consequently the TSR element of the award will not vest.
The EPS element of this award will not vest based on the 2016 performance.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through shares purchased via a trust.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.

For the discount for the TSR performance condition for the March 2016 Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 2.8 years prior to the grant has been used.
For the discount for the TSR performance condition for the July and October 2016 Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3 years prior to the grant has been used.
For the discount for the SAYE scheme, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index over a period of 3.3 years prior to the grant has been used.

Financial liabilities The financial liabilities of the Group comprise: 2016 2015 000 000 Overdraft 838 Trade and other payables excluding tax 101,533 106,641 Finance lease debt 393 355 Short-term financial liabilities 101,926 107,834 Long-term borrowings at floating interest rates 37,882 30,527 Finance lease debt 2,950 2,956 Long-term financial liabilities 40,832 33,483 Total financial liabilities 142,758 141,317 Total financial liabilities attracting interest were 39.0m 2015: 35.1m.
Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.79% 2015: 2.18%.
The average rate of interest charged during the year on the Groups debt was 2.26% 2015: 2.71%, and the average year-end rate was 1.79% 2015: 2.18%.
On 2016 results, net interest was covered 39.5 times 2015: 43.4 times by profit before tax, interest and exceptional items.
Based on year-end debt and profits for 2016, a 1% rise in interest rates would reduce profits before tax and exceptional items by 0.5% 2015: 0.4% and interest cover would reduce to 33 times 2015: 37.1 times.
At 1 January 2017 the Group had a cash balance of 9.6m 2015: 3.0m.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
At 1 January 2017 the Group has 101.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings 27 December 2015: 108.0m and 10.0m of undrawn overdraft 27 December 2015: 6.9m of undrawn overdraft.
92 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2016 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 22 Financial instruments and derivatives continued The maturity profile of anticipated gross future cash flows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below: At 1 January 2017 Trade and other Floating Finance payables rate lease Overdraft excluding tax loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 000 Within one year 101,533 8,009 393 109,935 Within two to five years 32,348 1,572 33,920 After five years 11,676 11,676 101,533 40,357 13,641 155,921 Less: future interest payments 2,475 10,298 12,773 101,533 37,882 3,343 142,758 At 27 December 2015 Trade and other Floating Finance payables rate lease Overdraft excluding tax loan debt Total 000 000 000 000 000 Within one year 838 106,641 1,844 355 109,678 Within two to five years 34,287 1,420 35,707 After five years 11,630 11,630 838 106,641 36,131 13,405 157,015 Less: future interest payments 5,604 10,094 15,698 838 106,641 30,527 3,311 141,317 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of commercial discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 3.3m from BH Restaurants Limited.
As a result of a detailed trading review of the business, the Board has made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 13.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2016 93 Notes to the accounts continued 22 Financial instruments and derivatives continued c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in June 2020 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the Directors Report.
d Foreign currency risk The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
Following the closure of the Groups three restaurants in Spain in 2011, any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is marginal and relates to the outstanding transactions in relation to the termination of the Spanish business.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile.
The Group does not currently have any interest rate swaps in place as the continued reduction in the level of debt combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
23 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Minimum Present value of lease payments minimum lease payments 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Within one year 393 355 393 355 Within two to five years 1,572 1,420 1,204 1,089 After five years 11,676 11,630 1,746 1,867 13,641 13,405 Less: future interest payments 10,298 10,094 Present value of lease obligations 3,343 3,311 3,343 3,311 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 393 355 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,950 2,956 Present value of lease obligations 3,343 3,311 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.3m 2015: 3.3m.
94 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2016 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 23 Lease commitments continued The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2016 2016 2015 2015 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 74,494 2,138 67,364 2,023 Within two to five years 264,390 7,485 233,242 6,756 After five years 547,689 18,301 497,972 18,561 886,573 27,924 798,578 27,340 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concessions business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
24 Capital commitments 2016 2015 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 37,268 42,650 25 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
26 Related party transactions There were no related party transactions in the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2017.
In the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2017, the Group received 0.1m of loan note interest from BH Restaurants Limited, all of which was recognised in the income statement 52 weeks ended 27 December 2015: 0.1m of interest, all of which was recognised in the income statement.
