As such, the assets and liabilities of OMAM, part of the Institutional Asset Management segment, are classified as held for sale at 31 December 2016.
Further analysis of significant balances included in OMAM assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows: a Goodwill and other intangible assets As at 31 December 2016, the market value of the Groups investment in OMAM, based on its quoted share price, was 863 million, compared to a carrying value of 602 million.
The Group has therefore concluded that the goodwill related to OMAM is not impaired.
b Deferred tax assets In evaluating OMAMs ability to recover its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence including the existence of cumulative income in the most recent financial years, changes in the business in which the OMAM operates, and the ability to forecast future taxable income.
The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence that is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.
OMAM has three years of cumulative earnings as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
As of December 31, 2016, management believes it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax asset will be realised based on forecasted taxable income.
c Investments and securities Investments and securities of 165 million comprise listed pooled investments of 64 million and unlisted pooled investments of 101 million.
The classification of investments and securities, in terms of the fair value hierarchy described in note E2 is as follows: m At 31 December 2016 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Designated fair value through profit or loss Investments and securities 165 70 28 67 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 273 Investments and securities classified as Level 3 relate to timber and real estate assets held by funds of OMAM.
Accounting standards require consideration of the effect of reasonable possible alternative assumptions on the fair value of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities.
A 10% change to the significant unobservable inputs of the Level 3 investments and securities above is in the range of 6 million favourable and 6 million unfavourable.
There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 or between Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
Of the 67 million Level 3 investments and securities, OMAM disposed of a 41 million timber investment in January 2017. d Borrowed funds In July 2016, OMAM announced underwritten public offerings of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $275 million of senior notes due 2026 the Institutional Notes, and $125 million of senior notes due 2031 the Retail Notes.
The Institutional Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.8% per year, payable on a semi-annual basis.
The Retail Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.1% per year, payable on a quarterly basis.
The Retail Notes are callable at par as of 1 August 2019. e Acquisition of Landmark Partners LLC Landmark On 18 August 2016, the Groups US listed subsidiary, OM Asset Management plc OMAM, acquired a 60% stake in the equity share capital of Landmark in exchange for cash consideration of $242 million 185 million in cash with the potential for an additional payment of up to $225 million 182 million on or around 31 December 2018.
As this potential additional payment is dependent on future service and other conditions, no amounts have been attributed to the consideration of the business.
Certain key members of the management team of Landmark have retained the remaining 40% interest in the business as ownership units.
Both the potential additional payment and the 40% ownership units held by management are recognised as share-based payment transactions due to service conditions and settlement features.
These arrangements vest over varying increments from 31 December 2018 through 31 December 2024.
At the date of acquisition, the Groups stake in OMAMs equity was 66%.
Landmark is based in the United States of America and is a leading global secondary private equity and property investment firm.
OMAM financed the acquisition through the proceeds of various note offerings, in particular $275 million of 4.8% senior notes due 27 July 2026 and $125 million of 5.1% senior notes due 1 August 2031.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the Group decided to dispose of its holding in OMAM and consequently the goodwill recognised on this acquisition was transferred from goodwill and other intangible assets to assets held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The results from the business have been consolidated since the date of the acquisition and the table below sets out the consolidated assets and liabilities acquired: m Acquirees carrying Fair amount value Assets Intangible assets 65 Property, plant and equipment 4 4 Cash and cash equivalents 18 18 Trade, other receivables and other assets 7 7 Total assets 29 94 Liabilities Deferred revenue 7 7 Trade, other payables and other liabilities 19 13 Total liabilities 26 20 Total net assets acquired 3 74 Total cash consideration paid 185 Goodwill recognised 111 The purchase price has been allocated based on a provisional estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition determined in accordance to IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The provisional allocation required significant assumptions and the use of external expertise and it is possible that the preliminary estimates may change materially as the purchase price allocations are finalised.
The accounting must be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 274 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 K: Discontinued operations and disposal groups held for sale continued K2: Assets and liabilities held for sale continued The carrying value of assets and liabilities in Landmarks consolidated statement of financial position at acquisition date approximated the fair value of these items determined by the Group, with the exception of identified intangible assets of 65 million and a reduction in other liabilities of 6 million.
Of the 65 million identified intangibles assets, 64 million relates to the value attributable to contractual relationships existing at the acquisition date to provide asset management advisory services and the remaining 1m relates to the Landmark trade name.
The value of the asset management contracts was determined using the excess earnings method in which the value is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.
The preliminary useful life for the asset management contacts has initially been estimated to be 13.4 years.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the net value assigned to the identified assets and liabilities acquired and are attributable to the delivery of cost and revenue synergies that cannot be linked to identifiable intangible assets.
Under US tax law, the goodwill and other intangibles recognised as a result of this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.
Transaction costs incurred of 5 million relating to the acquisition have been recognised within other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement, but excluded from the determination of adjusted operating profit.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2016, Landmark contributed a loss of 16 million to the profit after tax attributable to equity holders of OMAM, which includes amortisation of intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting and compensation expense for the arrangements with employees of Landmark noted above.
Prior period transactions At 31 December 2015, the Group classified total assets of 35 million comprising 20 million cash and cash equivalents and 10 million other assets and total liabilities of 12 million as held for sale in relation to the disposal of Rogge Global Partners Limited.

Emerging Markets Current and prior period transactions Emerging Markets has classified 1 16 million 2015: 84 million of investment properties as held for sale.

From this date the business was disclosed as held for sale.
A goodwill impairment loss of 46 million has been recognised in profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2016 as the net asset value of the business exceeded the net proceeds.
At 31 December 2016, the principal financial assets and liabilities included as held for sale were investments and securities of 6,189 million and investment contract liabilities of 6,164 million, all of which were classified as Level 1 in terms of the fair value hierarchy.
