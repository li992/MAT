98 Notes to the Financial Statements General accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union as at 31 December 2016.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments.
The Group uses a number of non-GAAP measures to present the financial performance of the business that are not defined under IFRS.
An explanation of these Alternative Performance Measures APMs, along with a reconciliation to the nearest equivalent IFRS measure can be found in Section E of these notes on page 134.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements see the Directors Report on page151.
Consolidation a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when: i it has power over the entity: ii is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity: and iii has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls a subsidiary if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of these three elements of control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances, and gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity.
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Changes in the Groups interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Please refer to Note B2 for details of disposal groups held for sale.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests which may cause the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Consideration in excess of net identifiable assets acquired in respect of non-controlling interests in existing subsidiary undertakings is taken directly to reserves.
b Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence over the financial and operating policies, but not control.
Significant influence is usually presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentation currency.
b Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments or deemed to be quasi-equity, are taken to other comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period end exchange rates.
c Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, or from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at reporting period end exchange rates, are recognised under the appropriate heading in the income statement: except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges or where certain intra-group loans are determined to be quasi-equity normally not expected to be repaid.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 99 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Notes to the Financial Statements Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument, and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Section C of these notes discusses accounting for financial instruments.
Financial assets At initial recognition the Group classifies its financial assets depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
This classification is re-evaluated at every reporting date and an assessment is made as to whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired.
Allfinancial assets are held at amortised cost except for derivatives and certain assets classified as available-for-sale, which are held at fair value.
Allfinancial assets are included in current assets unless they are expected to be realised, mature or disposed of after 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Financial assets are classified in the following categories: a Financial assets at fair value through the income statement These assets are often held for trading as they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the short term or part of a portfolio of assets subjected to trading.
Derivative assets are always held as financial assets at fair value though the income statement.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, subject to impairment.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available-for-sale assets are measured at fair-value and changes to market values are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On subsequent disposal or impairment, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets are impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
d Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that the Group intends and is able to hold to maturity.
They do not meet the definition of loans and receivables, and are not designated on initial recognition as assets at fair value through the income statement or as available-for-sale.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading except where they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, vacant property provisions, deferred consideration and borrowings.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 100 Notes to the Financial Statements Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Sensitivities to the estimates and assumptions are provided, where relevant, in the relevant Notes to the Financial Statements.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below please refer to the notes for further detail.
Estimated impairment of goodwill Note B3 Valuation of acquired intangible assets Note B3 Income taxes and deferred tax asset Notes A13 and A15 Provision for vacant property and environmental restoration Note A6 Retirement benefits Note A10 Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards that are mandatorily effective for the current year The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with effect from 1 January 2016: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle amendments to IFRS 5, 7 and IAS 19, 34 Investment Entities amendments to IFRS 10 Joint Arrangements amendments to IFRS 11 Presentation of Financial Statements amendments to IAS 1 Property, Plant and Equipment amendments to IAS 16 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures amendments to IAS 28 Intangible Assets amendments to IAS 38 The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures of the amounts recognised in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Consequently, no adjustment has been made to the comparative financial information at 31 December 2015.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
The Group has considered the impact on the financial statements of relevant forthcoming standards, including IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2019 respectively.
It is expected that substantially all of the Groups revenue will be treated as revenue from contracts with customers under IFRS 15, but the new standard will not require material changes to the timing of revenue recognition.
We also expect that certain sales commissions that meet the requirements stated within the standard may need to be recognised as an asset and amortised over the life of the contracts to which they relate.
This treatment is not anticipated to materially affect the profit of the Group.
As a result of the changes within the forthcoming standard IFRS 16 Leases, the majority of our existing operating leases will be accounted for as right of use assets, which will be largely offset by corresponding lease liabilities.
The assets will be recognised as property, plant and equipment, and the lease liability will increase net debt.
It is anticipated that operating expenses will decrease and financing costs will increase as the operating lease expense is replaced by depreciation and interest.
Depreciation will be straight-line over the life of the lease but the financing charge will decrease over the lease term.
The overall impact on net profit is not expected to be material.
The Group will consider the impact on the financial statements of the forthcoming standard: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018.

Segment information Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received from customers for the rendering of services, net of value-added tax VAT and other similar sales-based taxes, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-group sales.
Non-contract service revenue and contract service revenue represents the sales value of work carried out for customers during the period.
Contract income is recognised in accounting periods on a straightline basis over the life of the contract.
Segment reporting Segmental information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Reporting segments reflect the internal management organisation and reporting structures.
Each segment is headed by a Regional Managing Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive and is a member of the Executive Leadership Team responsible for the review of Group performance.
The operating businesses within each segment report to the Regional Managing Directors.
Given the international nature of the Group, foreign exchange movements can have a significant impact on regional performance and as a result, thesegmental analysis is presented at constant exchange rates CER.
Restructuring costs and central and regional overheads are presented separately as they are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.
The basis of presentation is consistent with the information reviewed byinternal management.
Revenue and profit are from ongoing operations which is defined and reconciled to the nearest equivalent GAAP measure inSection E on page 134.
Revenue and operating profit relate to the main groups of business category and activity, as described on page 11: Pest Control, Hygiene and Workwear.
Other represents a number of small businesses outside of the main categories, the largest being the plants business.
Central and regional overheads represent corporate expenses that are not directly attributable to any reportable segment.
Revenue at actual exchange rates AER from external customers attributed to the UK amounted to 216.7m 2015: 208.3m, with overseas countries accounting for the balance of 1,951.4m 2015: 1,550.7m.
The only countries accounting for more than 10% of revenue from external customers are France, totalling 340.1m 2015: 307.0m, and USA, totalling 642.2m 2015: 417.8m.
No customer accounts for more than 10% of total revenue.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust for UK employees see note at the bottom of the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which are treated as cancelled, and including share options for which all conditions have been met.
Adjusted earnings per share is earnings per share adjusted for the after-tax effects of one-off items, amortisation and impairment of intangibles, and net interest credit from pensions.
Adjusted profit and earnings per share measures are explained further in Section E on page 134.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential dilutive ordinary shares.
The Groups potentially dilutive ordinary shares relate to the contingent issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive share plans LTIPs to the extent the performance conditions have been met at the end of the period.
These share options are issued for nil consideration to employees if performance conditions are met.

Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Book value approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the receivables and the low-interest environment in which they are held.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Movements on provisions for impaired trade receivables are recognised within operating expenses in the income statement.
Amounts charged to the provision for impairment of trade receivables are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the Groups customer base being large and diverse.
The maximum amount of credit risk with respect to customers is represented by the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
The Group policy is that credit facilities for new customers are approved by designated managers at regional level.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
There were no new customers in 2016 where the Group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises design costs, raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Provisions for other liabilities and charges Vacant property, environmental, self-insurance and other provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount is capable of being reliably estimated.
If such an obligation is not capable of being reliably estimated it is classified as a contingent liability.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated on the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The present value is calculated using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for vacant properties and environmental restoration.
These provisions tend to be long-term in nature and the use of an appropriate market discount rate and forecast future utilisation based upon managements best estimate determines the level of provision required at the balance sheet date.
The phasing and actual cash spend may be different from the forecast on which the provision is based.

The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases at 31 December 2016 is 1.1m 2015:1.5m.
Environmental The Group owns a number of properties in Europe and the US where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
These provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next eight years.
Self-insurance Since 2008 the Group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks, but prior to this the Group self-insured its risks.
Provision is still held for self-insured past cover, primarily in relation to third party motor vehicle and employee liability.
For the continuing self-insured programmes, individual claims are met in full by the Group up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims is based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date and is accumulated as claims provisions.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, costs relating to disposed businesses and restructuring costs.
Existing provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within the next five years.

Employee benefit expense Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on calculations of achievements of financial performance targets and based on the best estimate of the obligation to employees related to personal performance criteria being achieved.
A provision isrecognised where a contractual obligation exists or where past practice indicates that there is a constructive obligation to make such payments inthe future.
Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not yet taken.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to present value where the effect of discounting is material.

Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many ofits employees.
The principal pension scheme in the Group is the Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS in the UK which has a number of defined benefit sections, which are now closed to new entrants, and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit scheme isfunded through payments to  fund, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
A number of much smaller defined benefit and defined contribution schemes operate elsewhere which are also funded through payments to trustee-administered funds or insurance companies.
Defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions.
Significant judgement is required indetermining these actuarial assumptions.
Defined benefit pension plans A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that estimates the amount of future pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, length of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The Group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit asset for the period byapplying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit asset.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have a credit rating of at least AA, are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The Group will recognise a pension surplus as an asset where there is an unconditional right to a refund or where the Group has a right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
Current and past service costs, to the extent they have vested, and curtailments are recognised as charges or credits against operating profit in the income statement.
Interest costs on the net defined benefit are recognised in finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Rentokil Initial 2015 Pension Scheme RIPS The assets of the RIPS are legally separated from the Group.
The Trustee of the pension fund is Rentokil Initial Pension Trustee Limited.
The board comprises six company nominated directors and three member nominated directors.
The Trustee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the RIPS.
The Group has recognised an asset in relation to the RIPS surplus as the Group has an unconditional right to reduce future pension contributions, taking into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
Actuarial valuations of the RIPS are usually carried out every three years.
At 31 December 2016 RIPS was valued at an accounting surplus of 272.0m 2015: 237.0m on the Groups balance sheet.
The Trustees of the RIPS value the scheme on a different basis and in the valuation at 31 December 2015 it was agreed that the RIPS is now fully funded.
The Trustees have therefore agreed that the annual payments of 3.2m the company has been paying into an escrow arrangement each January will not be required going forward.
In accordance with the terms of the escrow arrangement, the balance held in escrow was released back to the company on 16 February 2017.
The funding position will be reviewed at the next actuarial valuation, which is expected to be carried out at 31 December 2018.
The Group has put in place a guarantee in favour of the Trustee of the RIPS which provides that the Group will make payments to the RIPS up to amaximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to the assets of the RIPS, would result in the RIPS being at least 105% funded on the date on which any liability arises, calculated on the basis set out in section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This amount will vary and is in any event capped at 219m, the amount assessed at 31 March 2009.
The provision of the guarantee is reviewed on an annual basis.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 110 Notes to the Financial Statements The defined benefit schemes are reappraised semi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19R requirements.
The assumptions used for the RIPS scheme are shown below.
2016 2015 Weighted average Discount rate 2.6% 3.8% Future salary increases n a n a Future pension increases 3.4% 3.3% RPI inflation 3.5% 3.4% CPI inflation 2.4% 2.3% The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners.
Approximately 40% of the liabilities are attributable to current and former employees and 60% to current pensioners.
There have been no significant changes to the membership of the scheme over the year.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made.
For the RIPS as a whole, the duration is around 16 years.
Where available, the bid value of assets has been used.
In other cases the market value as provided by the investment managers has been used.
The RIPSs liability hedge is made up of interest rate and inflation swaps, corporate bonds, fixed gilts and LPI swaps.
The overall objective of the hedge is to match 85% of the interest rate and inflation sensitivity of the RIPSs liabilities c. 100% of assets.
The current portfolios return-seeking assets are diversified growth funds 13.6%.
Diversified growth funds invest in a range of asset classes including developed market equities, emerging market equities, hedge funds, infrastructure, commodities, private equity, property, high yield credit, emerging market debt, investment grade credit, reinsurance and leveraged loans.
Matching assets consist of 77% gilts and swaps, 9% corporate bonds and the remainder cash.
The actual holdings in matching assets are currently higher than the target portfolio.
This is monitored on a regular basis, and there are no plans to rebalance at present.
Risks The scheme exposes the Company to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The RIPS holds a small proportion of growth assets diversified growth funds which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the RIPS long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of scheme members, and allow for expected future improvements inmortality rates.
The mortality tables used are: 98% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male pensioners: 107% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for female pensioners: 108% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male and female non-pensioners: and 96% of the SAPS S2 All base tables for male and female dependent pensioners.
Future improvements are made in line with CMI 2014 Core Projections with a long-term rate of future improvement of 1.75% p. a.

Service costs, settlement and administration expenses are charged to operating expenses, and interest cost and return on plan assets to net interest credit from pensions.
The actuarial movement on the UK RIPS scheme comprises remeasurement loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions of 18.5m 2015: nil, remeasurement loss arising from changes infinancial assumptions of 238.1m 2015: remeasurement gain 64.6m and remeasurement losses arising from experience of 2.2m 2015: 18.1m gain.
Benefit plans in an obligation position include plans situated in Austria, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Martinique, Norway, Philippines, South Africa, Trinidad, and UK.
Benefit plans in an asset position include plans situated in UK, Australia and Barbados.
Included in the table above is a defined benefit obligation of 1,431.0m 2015: 1,186.2m and plan assets of 1,703.0m 2015: 1,423.2m in relation tothe UK RIPS scheme.
Total contributions payable to defined benefit pension schemes in 2017 are expected to be between 1m and 2m.

Share-based payments Share-based compensation The Group operates one equity-settled share-based long-term incentive plan.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement, equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of shares that vest or options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service, and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
Performance Share Plan The Company introduced a share-based performance plan in 2006 for senior executives worldwide.
The main features of the scheme are as follows: For awards made in 2008, the performance conditions are share price performance and an individual performance modifier.
For awards made in 2012 and 2013, the performance conditions are total shareholder return TSR performance and an individual performance modifier.
No shares will vest or options become exercisable if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the three-year performance period relative to the constituents of a comparator group, made up of FTSE 350 companies excluding financial services, primary resource and property sector companies.
If TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain their maximum bonus target over the performance period, the full award will vest or become exercisable.
For awards made between 2014 and 2016, one third of the award is based on earnings per share EPS growth targets as outlined in the relevant years Directors Remuneration Report, and two thirds of the award is based on TSR over the three-year performance period as explained above.
The value of dividends paid during the vesting period are paid on the number of shares that ultimately vest in the form of additional shares.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 5.5m 2015: 2.2m.
The table above has been restated to reflect the maximum number of shares granted.
In the year the shares vest, shares awarded relate to dividend equivalent shares.
The fair value of the 2016 awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a model developed by Deloitte LLP.
This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
For the shares awarded in March 2016, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 159.4p 2015: 135.5p, an expected share price volatility of 19% 2015:21%, a median share price correlation between the companies in the comparator group of 24% 2015: 27%, and an expected life commensurate with the three-year performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting period.
The fair value of shares granted during 2016 was 9.4m.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 114 Notes to the Financial Statements A12.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases properties, vehicles, and plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is 68.7m 2015: 36.3m.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Not later than one year 50.8 37.6 Later than one year and not later than five years 99.0 82.4 Later than five years 9.6 11.5 159.4 131.5 Included within the total operating leases figure as at 31 December 2016 is 18.3m in relation to leases that have been committed by the businesses which are intended to be sold as part of the transaction detailed in Note B2.
Income tax expense Income tax expense for the period includes both current and deferred tax.
Current tax expense represents the amount payable on this years taxable profits and any adjustment relating to prior years.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences between accounting and tax bases.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.

This compares with a blended rate of tax for the countries in which the Group operates of 25% 2015: 26%.
The lower adjusted ETR compared to the blended tax rate is principally due to the benefit of previously unrecognised brought forward tax losses being set off against UK profits.
The rate has also been reduced by a 4.3m reduction in the French deferred tax provision due to a planned reduction in French corporate tax rates.
The Groups ETR is expected to remain above the UK tax rate due to the proportion of overseas profits which are taxed at a higher rate than UK profits.
We expect our ETR for 2017 to be similar to 2016.
Weare not currently expecting any material change over the medium term although it is possible that tax reforms in the USA might have a significant impact given the growing importance of the Groups US operations.
The Groups tax charge and ETR will be influenced by the global mix and level of profits, changes in future tax rates and other tax legislation, the utilisation of brought forward tax losses on which no deferred tax asset has been recognised, the resolution of open issues with various tax authorities, the ability to benefit from existing financing arrangements, acquisitions and disposals.
In the longer term the Groups adjusted ETR is likely to be similar to the blended tax rate once there is no further benefit from tax losses on which nodeferred tax asset is currently recognised as their recoverability is not considered probable, but may become probable in the future.
Current tax liabilities The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
The Group is subject to various uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities where the ultimate tax liability cannot be known until a resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or the issue becomes time barred.
Issues can take many years to resolve and therefore assumptions on the likely outcome have to be made by management.
Where considered appropriate management establishes provisions for uncertain tax positions on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
The Groups current tax liabilities reflect managements best estimate of the future amounts of corporation tax that will be settled.
Total tax provisions and accruals amounted to 62.9m as at 31 December 2016 2015: 54.5m.
The increase in the tax provision is mainly due to another years provision in respect of existing identified exposures for which accruals had already been established and adverse foreign exchange movements.
Tax accruals can be built up over a number of years but in the year of resolution there could be adjustments to these accruals which could have a material positive or negative impact on the tax charge for a particular year.
The settlement of a significant issue could also have a material impact on the amount of cash tax payable in any one year.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes particularly in relation to the pricing of intra-group goods and services as well as debt financing.
The majority of the tax provisions relate to transfer pricing exposures where the Group faces a number of risks in jurisdictions around the world andis subject to audits by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates.
Apart from transfer pricing issues the largest single provision relates to a financing structure where the amount provided is now 18.5m.
This is a legacy issue going back to the years 2002 to 2005.
The Group is fully provided for the potential tax and interest payable so there should not be an adverse impact on the income statement.
It is unclear when this issue will be resolved.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 116 Notes to the Financial Statements A15.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in transactions other than a business combination that at the time of the transactions affect neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 17% effective from 1 April 2020 are enacted in UK law at the Balance Sheet date.
The UK deferred tax liability at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on the corporation tax rate that is expected to apply when the liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
In recognising the deferred tax asset in respect of UK losses, management have estimated the quantum of future UK taxable profits.
The movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 110.8 74.8 Exchange differences 16.6 3.2 Acquisition of companies and businesses 6.5 31.0 Transfers to current taxation 0.1 Credited charged to the income statement 0.2 2.4 Credit charged to equity 4.1 5.9 Transferred to disposal group held-for-sale 18.8 At 31 December 110.8 110.8 Deferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows: Deferred tax asset within non-current assets 2.0 2.0 Deferred tax liability within non-current liabilities 112.8 112.8 110.8 110.8 The major components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction are as follows: Customer Accelerated Unremitted lists tax Retirement earnings from Tax Share-based intangibles depreciation benefits subsidiaries losses payments Other Total m m m m m m m m At 1 January 2016 56.6 51.8 42.1 5.5 27.9 0.9 16.4 110.8 Exchange differences 9.2 9.5 2.1 16.6 Recognised in income statement 4.6 4.4 0.7 0.5 0.3 1.4 1.5 0.2 Recognised in other comprehensive income 3.3 0.8 4.1 Acquired in business combinations 6.5 6.5 Transferred to disposal group held-for-sale 4.8 14.2 0.2 0.1 0.3 18.8 At 31 December 2016 62.9 51.5 39.3 5.0 28.1 2.3 17.5 110.8 A deferred tax asset of 22.2m 2015: 26.1m has been recognised in respect of UK losses carried forward at 31 December 2016.
This amount has been calculated by estimating the future UK taxable profits, against which the UK tax losses will be utilised, and applying the tax rates substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date applicable for each year.
Remaining UK tax losses of 135.3m have not been recognised as at 31 December 2016.
At the balance sheet date the Group has tax losses of 229.6m 2015: 236.7m on which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Of the losses 36.1m 2015: 29.3m will expire at various dates between 2017 and 2035.
In addition, there are capital losses carried forward of 277.1m 2015: 277.1m onwhich no deferred tax asset is recognised.
Other deferred tax assets relating to gross temporary timing differences of 9.0m 2015: 9.1m have not been recognised due to the uncertainty regarding their utilisation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method acquisition accounting.
The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
An intangible asset is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The intangible assets arising on acquisition are goodwill, customer lists and relationships, and brands.
Goodwill represents the synergies, workforce and other benefits expected as a result of combining the respective businesses.
Deferred and contingent consideration is accounted for at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Costs directly attributable to business combinations are charged to the income statement as incurred and presented as one-off items.
During the year the Group purchased 100% of the share capital or trade and assets of 41 companies and businesses.
The total consideration in respect of these acquisitions was 107.1m and the cash outflow from current and past period acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was 109.2m.
Details of goodwill and the fair value of net assets acquired are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Purchase consideration: Cash paid 82.9 360.0 Deferred and contingent consideration 24.2 26.0 Total purchase consideration 107.1 386.0 Fair value of net assets acquired 60.0 80.3 Goodwill from current year acquisitions 47.1 305.7 Deferred consideration of 9.5m and contingent consideration of 14.7m is payable in respect of the above acquisitions.
Contingent consideration is payable based on a variety of conditions including revenue and profit targets being met.
Both deferred and contingent consideration are payable over the next four years.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of 1.9m.
The Group has included the contingent and deferred consideration based on the fair value of the consideration at the acquisition date.
The provisional fair value1 of assets and liabilities arising from acquisitions in the year are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Non-current assets: 2 Intangible assets 46.2 107.8 Property, plant and equipment 4.0 5.9 3 Current assets 39.7 19.7 Current liabilities 23.3 18.9 4 Non-current liabilities 6.6 34.2 Net assets acquired 60.0 80.3 1.
The provisional fair values will be finalised in the 2017 financial statements.
The fair values are provisional since the acquisition accounting has not yet been finalised as a result of the proximity of many acquisitions to the year end.
Includes 38.3m 2015: 96.2m of customer lists and relationships and 7.9m 2015: 11.6m of other intangibles.
Includes trade and other receivables of 24.1m 2015: 18.6m which represents the gross and fair value of the assets acquired.
Includes 6.4m of deferred tax relating to acquired intangibles 2015: 31.0m.

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2016 the revenue and operating profit of the Group would have amounted to 2,237.2m and 233.8m respectively as reported: 2,168.1m and 232.4m.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 118 Notes to the Financial Statements B2.
Disposal group held for sale The Group classifies a non-current asset or a disposal group as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale, and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement although gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated.
On the 16 December 2016 the Group announced an agreement to form a combined entity with the CWS-Boco businesses of Haniel & Cie. GmbH.
Under the terms of the arrangement, the Group will contribute its Workwear and Hygiene operations in ten countries principally in the Benelux andCentral and Eastern Europe the disposal group.
As consideration, the Group will receive c. 520m in cash and a c. 18% share in the combined entity, both subject to completion adjustments.
Completion of the transaction is subject to clearance of competition authorities.
The Groups interest in the combined entity will be recognised as an investment in associate.
The assets and liabilities of the disposal group have been classified as held for sale and are set out the table below.
Net assets of disposal group held for sale 2016 2015 m m Assets held-for-sale 1 Property, plant and equipment 163.1 Intangible assets 36.7 Inventories 2.0 Trade and other receivables 46.7 Liabilities held-for-sale Trade and other payables 43.5 Provisions 3.4 Retirement benefit obligations 1.4 Deferred and current tax 22.5 Net assets held-for-sale 177.7 1.
Within the total property, plant and equipment is 4.8m in relation to two properties not included in the disposal to Haniel, but are held for sale to different third parties.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, where applicable.

The fair value attributable to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Group.
The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows: Customer lists and relationships 5 to 16 years Brands 2 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 5 years Product development up to 5 years The following are the main categories of intangible assets with finite useful lives: a Customer lists and relationships Customer lists and relationships are acquired as part of business combinations.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated customer lists or relationships.
b Brands Brands are acquired as part of a business combinations.
Expenditure incurred to develop, maintain and renew brands internally is recognised as an expense in the period incurred.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated brands.
c Product development Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available.
d Computer software Costs including employee and software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group which are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding cost beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Acquired computer software is capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring it into use.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Includes 529.9m 2015: 179.7m relating to the US Pest Control CGU.
In 2016 the Steritech CGU was combined with US Pest Control CGU as the businesses became fully integrated.
Steritech had a goodwill balance of 235.3m in 2015.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary associate at the date of acquisition and is recognised in intangible assets.
Goodwill on the acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 120 Notes to the Financial Statements Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management, which is prepared as part of the Groups normal planning process.
Cash flows for years two to five use managements expectation of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
It can be demonstrated that there is material headroom in the recoverable amount of the CGU goodwill balances based on the assumptions made.
At 31 December 2016 impairment testing shows that there are no reasonable scenarios under which an impairment would be required.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 0.9% and 5.0% 2015: 1% and 5% and pre-tax discount rates of between 8% and 13% 2015: 8% and 15%.
The key assumptions used by the US Pest Control CGU were a long-term growth rate of 2% 2015: 2% and a pre-tax discount rate of 13% 2015: 12%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation with the exception of freehold land and assets under construction which are not depreciated.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
A breakdown of property, plant and equipment is shown below: Service Other plant Vehicles Land and contract and and office Total Total buildings equipment equipment equipment 2016 2015 m m m m m m Cost At 1 January 136.2 634.9 231.1 201.6 1,203.8 1,220.8 Exchange differences 24.4 115.4 39.4 43.2 222.4 67.3 Additions 3.5 153.1 14.5 30.7 201.8 167.8 Disposals 2.0 133.3 8.1 27.6 171.0 123.1 Acquisition of companies and businesses 0.3 0.7 11.6 12.6 5.7 Disposal of companies and businesses 0.1 Transferred to disposal group held-for-sale 65.7 346.5 84.4 33.8 530.4 At 31 December 96.4 423.9 193.2 225.7 939.2 1,203.8 Accumulated depreciation and impairment At 1 January 44.1 393.6 163.4 125.6 726.7 715.3 Exchange differences 9.1 75.0 28.6 28.0 140.7 41.5 Disposals 0.9 131.2 7.8 25.5 165.4 116.7 Disposal of companies and businesses 0.1 Impairment 7.4 Depreciation charge 4.5 134.6 15.2 34.0 188.3 162.3 Transferred to disposal group held-for-sale 30.0 252.6 57.5 27.3 367.4 At 31 December 26.8 219.4 141.9 134.8 522.9 726.7 Net book value At 1 January 92.1 241.3 67.7 76.0 477.1 505.5 At 31 December 69.6 204.5 51.3 90.9 416.3 477.1 Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 121 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Notes to the Financial Statements Depreciation of assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between their cost and their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 to 100 years Leasehold buildings shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles 4 to 5 years Plant and equipment including service contract equipment 3 to 10 years Office equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and amended as necessary.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the higher of its fair value less cost to sell or value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing value-in-use, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cashgenerating units and cash flow forecasts are made using assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date budgets and plans that have been formally approved by management.
These cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, adjusted for the particular risks of the cash-generating unit being reviewed for impairment.
When assets are sold, the difference between sale proceeds and net book value is recognised in the income statement.
The category of service contract equipment represents the pool of assets used by the Group in delivering contracted services to customers.
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and offices.
Finance leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the leaseterm.
The net carrying amounts of assets held under finance leases are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Vehicles and office equipment 38.3 24.0 Other plant and equipment 0.4 0.2 38.7 24.2 B5.

Financial risk management The Group operates a central treasury function which manages cash, borrows on behalf of the Group, and provides finance to Group companies intheir local currencies.
Treasury activity is governed by a Treasury Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are set out below.
a Liquidity risk The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its business needs, and appropriate reserves to cover operational underperformance or dislocation in the financial markets.
The Groups policy is to have headroom of unrestricted cash and available committed facilities of at least 150m and the Treasury Committee manages financing requirements and associated headroom at least 12 months forward.
The Group has a Revolving Credit Facility RCF with 12 relationship banks, a Term Loan and a number of bilateral committed credit facilities seeNote C6 for details.
All of these facilities contain covenants that require EBITDA:Net Interest to be at least 4.0:1.0 and that Net Debt: Adjusted EBITDA should be no greater than 3.5:1.0 at each semi-annual reporting date.
Compliance with financial and other covenants is reviewed regularly and financial covenants are reported to the lenders under the facilities semi-annually.
The Group remains compliant with its covenants.
The Group targets a Standard & Poors S&P investment grade credit rating for debt issuance of BBB over the medium term.
In line with S&P liquidity ratio requirements, debt maturities are financed at least 12 months in advance using available headroom or by new debt issuance.
Management maintains an active dialogue with S&P as well as the Groups relationship banks to ensure that any changes to the Groups financing and acquisition strategies are understood.
At 31 December 2016 the Groups earliest maturity was the 50m bond due March 2018.
The Group had unrestricted cash of 71.9m and 204.4m of available commitments under its credit facilities, giving combined headroom of 275.9m to meet this obligation 2015: 502.0m of combined headroom.
All of the Groups bonds issued under its Euro Medium-Term Note EMTN Programme, contain a coupon step-up which increases the coupon payable by 1.25% in the event that the Group is downgraded to BB or below sub-investment grade.
The Groups EMTNs may be recalled by their investors at par in the event of a change of control of the Group.
They may also be recalled within 120 days if the Groups debt is downgraded below investment grade, or if the rating is withdrawn and the rating agency confirms in writing, either publicly or to the Group or the Trustee, that the rating action occurred either wholly or in part due to a change of control.
b Credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Sales are typically low-value, high-volume, spreading the risk across a number of customers.
Policies are in place to ensure that credit sales are only made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group operates in some territories where there is increased exposure to trade credit risks and in those territories the Group puts in place appropriate measures to manage its credit risk exposure.
In order to protect the liquid assets and funding relationships of the Group, management aims to maintain banking relationships with counterparties that carry a long-term credit rating of at least A-.
In countries where no banks are rated Aor above, balances are monitored monthly and kept to a minimum.
In addition, funds held with all counterparties are subject to limits.
All exposures are monitored daily and reported to the Treasury Committee each month.
The Group also monitors the creditworthiness of its lenders to ensure available commitments under its facilities are available as needed.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had a total of 11.0m of cash held on bank accounts with banks rated below Aby S&Ps of which 3.4m was covered by the German Governments Bankverband.
The highest concentration with any single bank not covered by a government guarantee was1.8m.
c Market risk Interest rate risk The Group seeks to manage interest rate risk to ensure reasonable certainty of its interest charge whilst allowing an element of risk exposure consistent with the variability of its cash flows.
Interest rate risk is managed by the use of fixed interest debt and interest rate derivatives, which are approved in advance by the Treasury Committee.
The Group policy is to fix a minimum of 50% of its estimated future interest rate exposures excluding pensions for a minimum period of 12 months forward.
The Treasury Committee reviews this exposure monthly.
A hypothetical 1.0% increase in euro and sterling interest rates would reduce the market value of the Groups bond liabilities by 36.2m at 31December 2016 2015: 32.0m.
The income statement impact is nil as changes in interest rates do not change the expected cash flows onthebonds.
The Group had outstanding bond debt issues at 31 December 2016 with a fair market value of 845.1m 2015: 1,016.4m.
This exceeds the book value of 763.0m 2015: 972.3m as a result of reductions in interest rates in the UK and Europe and improved investor credit appetite.
There are no circumstances where the Group would be obliged to pay the fair market value.
The Group could however decide to redeem some or all of its bonds early and the fair market value is indicative of the price that would be required to do so.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups worldwide operations generate profits and cash flows in foreign currencies.
Sales and purchases are typically denominated in the currency of the country in which they are transacted, and the Groups cross-border procurement is considered insignificant.
Sterling procurement and central costs mean that foreign currencies constitute more than 100% of Group adjusted profit before interest, tax and amortisation APBITA at approximately 111%.
The Groups primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is in relation to the translation of assets and liabilities, and the Group aims to hold debt in currencies that match its forecast foreign currency profits and investments.
FX derivatives are used to manage foreign currency exposures in excess of 0.5m that are not covered by debt or assets in the same or another highly-correlated currency.
The Treasury Committee monitors foreign exchange exposures on a monthly basis.
Dealing in foreign exchange products is controlled by dealing mandates approved by the Treasury Committee and all FX transactions are covered by ISDA documentation.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 124 Notes to the Financial Statements The most significant foreign currency groups are euros and US dollars, which make up 54% and 28% of Group APBITA respectively.
At 31 December 2016 the Groups net debt was approximately 57% euro 2015: 57%, reflecting that it is the Groups principal cash flow exposure: and 48% US dollars 2015: 44%, reflecting the size of the US market and the Groups strong growth and investment in this region.
This is offset by 5% of cash in other currencies.
The translation of the interest element of euro and US dollar debt provides a partial income statement offset to the translation of earnings.
The Group calculates the impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups principal foreign currency exposure is to euro.
A 10% movement in would result in a 14.0m increase decrease 2015: 13.3m in adjusted operating profit, offset by a 2.1m decrease increase 2015: 1.9m in interest payable.
For US dollars, a 10% movement in $ would result in a 7.2m increase decrease 2015: 4.2m in adjusted operating profit, offset by a 0.8m decrease increase 2015: 0.9m in interest payable.
Where possible, currency cash flows are used to settle liabilities in the same currency in preference to selling currency in the market.
d Capital risk The Group is committed to maintaining a debt equity structure which allows continued access to a broad range of financing sources and sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they present themselves, without onerous financing terms and conditions.
The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support the Groups strategy.
Capital consists of ordinary shares, retained earnings and non-controlling interests in the Group.
Management monitor the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
e Treasury risk The Groups treasury activities are governed by a treasury policy, which is reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis.
The treasury policy covers all activities associated with managing the above risks.
The policy requires that financial instruments are only utilised to manage known financial exposures and speculative derivative contracts are not entered into.
The treasury policy requires that treasury must approve opening and closing of all bank accounts, and that funds transfers and other payments are only made in accordance with bank mandates.
To ensure an appropriate control environment exists in the treasury function, duties are segregated between front and back office teams.
In addition a number of controls are in place to protect against potential cyber security risks.

Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and subject to insignificant changes in value.
In the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents are shown netof bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Included within cash at bank and in hand is 25.2m 2015: 12.3m of restricted cash.
This cash is held in respect of specific contracts and can only be utilised in line with terms under the contractual arrangements.
The Group operates pooling arrangements whereby cash balances and overdrafts held within the same bank are offset to give a net balance which is included within cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
These cash and bank overdraft figures before netting are shown in the table below: Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Gross amounts Gross before amounts Net amounts offsetting setoff presented m m m At 31 December 2016 Cash at bank and in hand 767.9 609.7 158.2 Short-term bank deposits 2.0 2.0 Cash and cash equivalents 769.9 609.7 160.2 Bank overdraft 664.0 609.7 54.3 105.9 105.9 At 31 December 2015 Cash at bank and in hand 560.9 464.2 96.7 Short-term bank deposits 5.9 5.9 Cash and cash equivalents 566.8 464.2 102.6 Bank overdraft 466.3 464.2 2.1 100.5 100.5 Credit interest rates on bank balances range between 0.7% and 4.5% and debit interest rates range between 0.0% and 2.5%.
As far as it is practical to do so, cash balances are held centrally and are used first to repay borrowings under the Groups Revolving Credit Facility before being placed on deposit.
Other investments Other investments held at year end mainly comprised term deposits maturing in more than three months from the date that the deposit was placed.
Fixed-rate cash deposits include short-term deposits of nil held centrally 2015: 95.0m at an interest rate of 1.0%.
Fixed-rate cash deposits also include 6.0m 2015:1.5m invested with counterparty banks which are held by the Groups insurance operations in accordance with local insurance regulations.

Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 126 Notes to the Financial Statements C5.
Derivative financial instruments Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.
Certain financial instruments are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Typically the Group will not designate financial instruments for hedge accounting where a perfect or near perfect offset is expected between the change in value of assets and liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments in this category are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Where financial instruments are designated for hedge accounting they are designated as either: a Fair value hedge These instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Net investment hedge These instruments are used to hedge exposure on translation of net investments in foreign operations.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In the event of disposal of a foreign operation, the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement.
c Cash flow hedge These instruments are used to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction or a change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement.
The gains or losses that are recognised in comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
In the event the hedged item occurs or is no longer expected to occur, accumulated gains or losses held in the cash flow hedge reserve are immediately recognised in the income statement.
In the event the hedged item is expected to occur but no longer meets the requirements of the hedge accounting, accumulated gains or losses remain in other comprehensive income and are only recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to derivatives marked as cash flow hedge in the following table in accordance with IAS 39.
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, related derivatives have been marked as non-hedge.
Any ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedge is taken directly to finance costs.
There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges or those derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship.
Cash flow hedge accounting has been applied to the 50m bond maturing in March 2018, hedging the changes in cash flow due to volatility in the sterling euro exchange rate during the term of the bonds.

Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 134 Notes to the Financial Statements E: Alternative Performance Measures Definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures The Group uses a number of measures to present the financial performance of the business which are not GAAP measures as defined under IFRS.
Management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in order to understand the underlying trading performance of the business.
The Groups internal strategic planning process is also based on these measures and they are used for incentive purposes.
They should be viewed as complements to, and not replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures.
Constant exchange rates CER Given the international nature of the Groups operations, foreign exchange movements can have a significant impact on the reported results when they are translated into sterling the functional currency of the Group.
In order to help understand the underlying trading performance of the business, unless otherwise stated, percentage movements for Revenue and Operating Profit are presented at constant exchange rates CER.
Constant exchange rates are calculated by retranslating current year reported numbers at the full-year average exchange rates for the prior year, inorder to give management and other users of the accounts better visibility of underlying performance against the prior period.
Comparisons are to the year ended 31December 2015 2015 unless otherwise stated.
Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit represent the performance of the continuing operations of the Group including acquisitions after removing the effect of disposed or closed businesses.
Ongoing Operating Profit is an adjusted measure and is presented before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets excluding computer software and one-off items see below.
Ongoing measures enable the users of the accounts to focus on the performance of the businesses retained by the Group, that will therefore contribute to future performance.
Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit are presented at CER unless otherwise stated.
A reconciliation of Ongoing Revenue and Ongoing Operating Profit to the equivalent GAAP measure is provided in the table below and in the segmental analysis inNote A1.
Adjusted profit and earnings per share measures Adjusted profit measures are used to give management and other users of the accounts a clear understanding of the underlying profitability of the business over time by removing distortions caused by non-recurring expenses and income, and the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on the acquisition of businesses.
Adjusted profit measures are calculated by adding the following items back to the equivalent GAAP profit measure: Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets excluding computer software One-off items Net interest credit from pensions Intangible assets excluding computer software are recognised on the acquisition of businesses which by their nature can vary by size and amount each year.
Accordingly, amortisation of intangibles is added back to assist with the understanding of the underlying trading performance of the business and to allow comparability across regions and categories.
One-off items are significant expenses or income which will have a non-recurring impact on the profitability of the Group.
Typical examples are costs related to the acquisition of businesses including aborted acquisitions, gain or loss on disposal or closure of a business, material gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets, adjustments to legacy property-related provisions vacant property and environmental liabilities, and payments or receipts as a result of legal disputes.
One-off items are analysed in Note A1.
The net interest credit from pensions has the potential to vary significantly dependent on actuarial revaluations of the pension schemes.
In order to ensure year on year comparability this is added back to arrive at adjusted measures.
The Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income and Note A1 show how the measures are calculated and reconciled to GAAP measures.
Adjusted earnings per share is earnings per share before the after-tax effects of amortisation and impairment of intangibles excluding computer software, one-off items and net interest credit from pensions.

Organic Revenue growth measures are used to help understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Organic Revenue growth represents the growth in Ongoing Revenue excluding the effect of businesses acquired during the year.
Acquired businesses are included in organic measures in the year following acquisition, and the comparative period is adjusted to include an estimated full-year performance for growth calculations.
The table below reconciles organic measures by category to the comparable GAAP measures.
The Regional reporting segments reflect the internal management organisation and reporting structure of the Group.
The Category reporting segments reflect the different operational categories of Pest Control, Hygiene, Workwear and Other.
Other represents a number of smaller businesses outside of the main categories, the largest being the Plants business.
In addition, the business uses a quadrant analysis tool for capital allocation and operational management.
Businesses are grouped by geography and category into a growth-potential and profit-contribution matrix.
Using this approach enables the business to introduce different growth levers tomaximise impact and apply differential investment hurdle rates.
Prior to 2016 restructuring costs were an adjustment in arriving at adjusted profit measures.
In 2016 they are no longer adjusted for, but are presented in the segmental analysis in order to provide comparability with 2015.
Central and regional overheads are costs which cannot be allocated to any specific segment.
Segmental analysis is presented at CER unless otherwise stated.
Operating Margin for ongoing operations and continuing operations is calculated after central and regional overheads and restructuring costs.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 138 Notes to the Financial Statements Free Cash Flow The Group aims to generate sustainable cash flow in order to support its acquisition programme and to fund dividend payments to shareholders.
Free Cash Flow is measured as net cash from operating activities, adjusted for cash flows related to the purchase and sale of property, plant, equipment and intangible fixed assets, and dividends received from associates.
These items are considered by management to be non-discretionary, as continued investment in these assets is required to support the day-to-day operations of the business.
