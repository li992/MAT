Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 260 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 J: Other notes J1: Post-employment benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world.
These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.

The effect to the Groups obligation of a 1% increase and 1% decrease in the assumed health cost trend rates would be an increase of 31 million and decrease of 25 million 2015: increase of 20 million and decrease of 17 million respectively.
Total contributions expected to be paid to the Group pension plans for the year ending 31 December 2017 are 10 million subject to any reassessments to be completed in the year.

The weighted average share price at date of exercise for options exercised during the year was R176.44 2015: R247.
37. b Measurements and assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Share options are granted under a service and non-market based performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the share options granted.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The grant date for the UK and South African plan awards is deemed to be 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue.
As such the Group is required to estimate, at the reporting date, the number and fair value of the options that will be granted in the following year.
The fair value of awards expected to be granted in 2016 which will have an IFRS 2 grant date of 1 January 2016, is shown separately below.
The grant date for all other awards is the award issue date.
c Forfeitable Restricted share grants The following summarises the fair value of restricted shares granted by the Group during the year: Instruments granted and purchased during the year Weighted Number average granted fair value Shares in Old Mutual plc London Stock Exchange 2016 25,126,598 1.67 2015 11,544,922 2.08 Shares in Old Mutual plc Johannesburg Stock Exchange 2016 20,284,617 R39.71 2015 14,244,304 R42.24 Shares in Nedbank Ltd 2016 5,068,162 R177.97 2015 3,879,259 R231.76 The share price at measurement date was used to determine the fair value of the restricted shares.
Expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value where the holder of the restricted share is entitled to dividends throughout the vesting period.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 263 d Annual bonus awards The UK and South Africa Plan Awards give rise to annual bonus awards.
The level of annual bonus awards is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of individual and company performance targets, measured over the financial year prior to the date the employees receive the award.
The accounting grant date for the South African and UK annual bonus plans other than the new joiner and newly qualified grants has therefore been determined as 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue of the grants.
The Group anticipates awards under the South African scheme of 6,222,592 restricted shares 2015: 8,243,127.
The restricted shares have been valued using a share price of R34.44 2015: R41.45.
The Group estimate of the total fair value of the annual bonus expected to be paid in the form of options and forfeitable shares is outlined below.
The fair value is determined by making an estimate of the level of bonus to be paid out following the attainment of personal and company performance conditions.

J3: Related parties The Group provides certain pension fund, insurance, banking and financial services to related parties.
These are conducted on an arms length basis and are not material to the Groups results.
a Transactions with key management personnel, remuneration and other compensation Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, directly or indirectly, including any Director whether executive or otherwise of the Group.
Details of the compensation paid to the Board of Directors as well as their shareholdings in the Company are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 104 to 139. b Key management personnel remuneration and other compensation Y ear ended Y ear ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Number of Number of personnel 000 personnel 000 Directors fees 11 1,584 11 1,388 Remuneration 25,133 24,293 Cash remuneration 14 6,228 12 5,308 Short-term employee benefits 14 9,828 12 8,678 Long-term employee benefits 14 280 12 378 Share-based payments 11 8,797 12 9,929 26,717 25,681 Share options Y ear ended Y ear ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Number of Number of options options Number of shares Number of shares personnel 000s personnel 000s Outstanding at beginning of the year 4 52 5 48 Leavers 1 11 Granted during the year 6 29 Exercised during the year 14 Outstanding at end of the year 4 58 4 52 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 264 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 J: Other notes continued J3: Related parties continued b Key management personnel remuneration and other compensation continued Restricted shares Y ear ended Y ear ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Number of Number of options options shares Number of shares Number of 000s personnel 000s personnel Outstanding at beginning of the year 9 11,066 9 13,753 Leavers 2 2,974 1 3,538 New appointments 2 5,215 1 2,056 Granted during the year 11,566 3,055 Exercised during the year 206 944 Vested during the year 1,225 3,316 Outstanding at end of the year 9 23,442 9 11,066 c Key management personnel transactions Key management personnel and members of their close family have undertaken transactions with Old Mutual plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings in the normal course of business, details of which are given below.

These include unit trusts, mutual funds and hedge funds.
None of the amounts concerned are material in the context of the funds managed by the Group business concerned, and all of the investments have been made by the individuals concerned either on terms which are the same as those available to external clients generally or, where that is not the case, on the same preferential terms as were available to employees of the business generally.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 265 J4: Contingent liabilities m At At 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Guarantees and assets pledged as collateral security 965 1,198 Secured lending 806 401 Irrevocable letters of credit 210 196 Other contingent liabilities 10 4 The Group has provided certain guarantees for specific client obligations, in return for which the Group has received a fee.
The Group has evaluated the extent of the possibility of the guarantees being called on and has provided appropriately.
The Group, through its South African banking business, has pledged debt securities and negotiable certificates of deposit amounting to 1,128 million 2015: 681 million as collateral for deposits received under re-purchase agreements.
These amounts represent assets that have been transferred but do not qualify for derecognition under IAS 39.
These transactions are entered into under terms and conditions that are standard industry practice for securities borrowing and lending activities.
Contingent liabilities tax The Revenue authorities in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States routinely review historic transactions undertaken and tax law interpretations made by the Group.
The Group is committed to conducting its tax affairs in accordance with the tax legislation of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
All interpretations made by management are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances of the transaction and the relevant legislation.
There are occasions where the Groups interpretation of tax law may be challenged by the Revenue authorities.
The financial statements include provisions that reflect the Groups assessment of liabilities which might reasonably be expected to materialise as part of their review.
The Board is satisfied that adequate provisions have been made to cater for the resolution of tax uncertainties and that the resources required to fund such potential settlements are sufficient.
Due to the level of estimation required in determining tax provisions amounts eventually payable may differ from the provision recognised.
Nedbank litigation There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank Group Ltd and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen.
The largest potential claim relates to Pinnacle Point Group Limited, where ABSA Bank Limited ABSA has initiated an action in the High Court against Nedbank Limited Nedbank for the sum of R773 million, where ABSA alleges that Nedbank had a legal duty of care to it in relation to certain single stock futures transactions.
In a matter relating to the same events, New Port Finance Company Pty Ltd and Winifred Trust have sued ABSA for R405 million and R65 million respectively, alleging that ABSA had a duty of care towards them.
During November 2016 ABSA joined Nedbank as a third party to that action claiming that, should ABSA be held liable, then ABSA would be entitled to claim a contribution from Nedbank.
Nedbanks counsel is of the view that Nedbank has a strong case to successfully resist both matters.
Consumer protection Old Mutual is committed to treating customers fairly and supporting its customers in meeting their lifetime goals and treating customers fairly is central to how our businesses operate.
We routinely engage with customers and regulators to ensure that we meet this commitment, but there is the risk of regulatory intervention across various jurisdictions, giving rise to the potential for customer redress which can result in retrospective changes to policyholder benefits, penalties or fines.
The Group monitors the exposure to these actions and makes provision for the related costs as appropriate.
On 3 March 2016, the UK Financial Conduct Authority FCA issued a report detailing its findings of their industry-wide thematic review on the fair treatment of long-standing customers invested in closed-book products sold by the life insurance sector Thematic Review and announced that it was initiating an investigation into a number of firms, including Old Mutual Wealth Life Assurance Limited OMWLA, a subsidiary of Old Mutual Wealth, in relation to potential breaches of the FCAs standards relevant to the matters covered by the Thematic Review.
OWMLA is working with the FCA and is cooperating with its investigation, but as with any regulatory investigation of this nature it is difficult to predict when the investigation will be completed or its outcome and therefore no provision has been recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Implications of the managed separation strategy The Group routinely monitors and reassesses contingent liabilities arising from matters such as litigation, and warranties and indemnities relating to past acquisitions and disposals.
The adoption of the managed separation strategy on 1 1 March 2016 does not affect the nature of such items, however it is possible that the Group may seek to resolve certain matters as part of the implementation of the managed separation strategy.

Those assets that are held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in these financial statements.
Some of these arrangements involve the Group accepting targets for benchmark levels of returns for the assets under the Groups care.
These services give rise to the risk that the Group will be accused of misadministration or under-performance.
J8: Businesses acquired during the year a Acquisition of Banco Unico SA On 3 October 2016 the Group acquired a 10.9% share in Banco Unico, SA to reach a controlling 50% plus one share 2015: 38.3% share.
The acquiree is a banking entity in Mozambique and the acquisition, in line with the Groups strategy of expanding into the rest of Africa, was made by purchasing Banco Unico, SA shares from a third party.
The accounting related to the step up in ownership from 38.3% to 50% plus one share is such that it effectively requires a simultaneous sale of 38.3% followed by an acquisition of the fair value of 50% plus one share of the business.
Consequently a loss of 1 1 million was realised on the transaction.
Consistent with usual Group practice, this loss was recognised in profit or loss but excluded from the determination of AOP.
As the Group now has a controlling interest of 50% plus one share, the financial results and position of Banco Unico, SA have been consolidated with effect from 3 October 2016.
The assets and liabilities acquired have been recorded at their fair values for purposes of the opening balance sheet and included in the consolidated accounts of the Group using the Groups accounting policies in accordance with IFRS.
