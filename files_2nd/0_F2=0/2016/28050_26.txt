37.0m 2015: 37.0m of this amount represented the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values, including the brand value of Charles Church which is classified as goodwill as this was acquired before the date of transition to IFRSs, are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes down to a lower level than the Groups single operating segment, being to Charles Church and to the portfolios of strategic land holdings throughout the UK acquired with Beazer and Westbury.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct cost changes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated for four years, to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
When performing the impairment review of the brands, the relevant retraction growth rates included therein vary between -4% to 1% 2015: -3% to 1%, reflecting the current state of the UK housing market.
The retraction growth rates in relation to the impairment review of goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings vary between -3% to 2% 2015: -3% to 2%.
After this period the growth rates applied to calculate the cash flow forecasts vary between nil and 2% 2015: nil and 2% reflecting managements estimate of the forecast recovery in the UK housing market, which do not exceed the long term average growth rates forthe industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 5% and 8% 2015: 5% and 9% over the forecast periods.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 10 8 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
This review resulted in an underlying impairment of 8.0m 2015: 8.3m.
This charge reflects ongoing consumption of the acquired strategic land holdings.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill will be completely impaired once the final plot for which management expects to receive a satisfactory planning permission is sold.
On concluding the annual impairment testing, there remains 89.5m 2015: 95.8m and 27.1m 2015: 28.8m of Beazer and Westbury goodwill allocated to strategic land holdings and 37.0m 2015: 37.0m allocated to the Charles Church brand.
In addition, there is 60.0m 2015: 60.0m of carrying value in relation to the Westbury brand.
No reasonable possible change in any of the assumptions noted above would lead to an impairment charge being required.
However, in the event of deterioration in the UK housing market conditions, operating margins reducing, or appropriate discount rates increasing the possibility of impairment losses in the future remains.

Of the gains recognised in finance income for the period 5.9m 2015: 7.3m was unrealised.
Available for sale financial assets, also known as shared equity receivables, comprise loans, largely with a ten year term and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
Loans are repayable at the borrowers option, on sale or transfer of the related property or other redemption of the first legal charge or at the end of the fixed term.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the Directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The Directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each financial reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to finance income, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
Credit risk, which the Directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining fair values and appropriate discount factors are applied.
The Directors review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.
There were no indicators of impairment at 31 December 2016 2015: nil.
The Directors expect an average maturity profile of between five and ten years from the balance sheet date.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 21.
17 Inventories 2016 2015 m m Land 1,946.4 2,046.7 Work in progress 617.2 517.9 Part exchange properties 37.1 38.3 Showhouses 44.3 42.4 2,645.0 2,645.3 The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion ofinventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subject to a number of issues, including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Group conducted a further review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress portfolio during 2016.
Our approach to this review has been consistent with that conducted at 31 December 2015.
This review gave rise to a reversal of 7.7m 2015: 9.8m ofprovision on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period and an impairment of land and work in progress of 7.7m 2015: 9.8m.
This reversal charge arose due to forecast selling prices and development costs on individual sites being higher or lower than previously estimated by management as a result of changing conditions, and or development plans.
Net realisable provisions held against inventories at 31 December 2016 were 48.5m 2015: 62.9m.
The key judgements in estimating the future net realisable value of a site were the estimation of likely sales prices, house types and costs to complete the developments.
Sales prices and costs to complete were estimated on a site by site basis based upon existing market conditions.
If the UK housing market were to improve or deteriorate in the future then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following the 2016 review, 34.1m 2015: 54.4m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 113 17 Inventories continued Land with a carrying value of 1,031.0m 2015: 1,024.3m was used as security for land payables note 20.

The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.
Land payables are reduced for imputed interest, which is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the credit period of the purchase contract.
21 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to them.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered to apply to the Company as well.
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs an annual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and the value of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimise its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group has investments in a number of Portuguese joint ventures.
These interests are not hedged.
These investments are considered to be long term in nature.
At 31 December 2016 the Group also holds 1.8m of cash related to committed plant purchases.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 115 21 Financial risk management continued The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2016 2015 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate Euro 1.22 1.17 1.38 1.36 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2016 2015 m m Investments 3.2 3.9 Cash 1.8 Total 5.0 3.9 Sensitivity analysis A rise fall in the Euro Sterling exchange rate of 10% would result in a 0.4m loss gain in relation to investments 2015: 0.3m.
Interest rate risk The Group currently holds no fixed interest borrowings.
This reflects both the low borrowing requirements of the Group and the current low interest rates applicable to floating borrowings.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed to floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board and is continually reviewed in the light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Sensitivity analysis If in the year ended 31 December 2016 UK interest rates had been 0.25% higher lower then the Groups pre-tax profit would have increased decreased by 1.0m 2015: increased decreased by 0.4m.
The Groups post-tax profit would have increased decreased by 0.8m 2015: increased decreased by 0.3m.
These sensitivities have been prepared in respect of the direct impact of such an interest rate change on the net financing expense of financial instruments only, and do not attempt to estimate the indirect effect such a change may have on the wider economic environment such as house pricing, mortgage availability and exchange rates.
Housing market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the risk of local microeconomic fluctuations.
The Group has taken steps to control its speculative build, land acquisition activities and work in progress levels so as to manage the exposure of the Group to any further market disruption.
Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2016, if UK house prices had been 5% higher lower, and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial instruments, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would increase decrease in value, excluding any effects of current or deferred tax, by 7.4m 2015: 8.9m.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy in relation to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
Therefore the Group remains confident of its continued compliance with financial covenants under the syndicated loan even in the event of deterioration in market conditions.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 116 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial risk management continued The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
The liabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on i a daily basis to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: ii a monthly basis to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium term liquidity is maintained: and iii a long term projection basis for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size of the Group.
The Group operates short term uncommitted overdraft facilities to meet day to day liquidity requirements.
These facilities are cancellable on request from the bank: however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these in favour of more cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by five leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group maintains a 300m revolving credit facility committed to March 2021.
These committed facilities are sufficient to meet projected liquidity requirements to this date.
Undrawn committed facilities at the reporting date amount to 300m 2015: 300m.
Cash deposits The Group has a policy of ensuring cash deposits are made with the primary objective of security of principal.
Accordingly deposits are made only with approved, respected, high credit rating financial institutions.
Deposits are spread across such institutions to minimise exposure to any single entity and are made on a short term basis only to preserve liquidity.
Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of net cash debt borrowings as detailed in note 19 offset by cash and bank balances and equity of the Group comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in the statement of changes in shareholders equity.
The Groups objective in managing capital is primarily to ensure the continued ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst also maintaining an appropriate balance of equity and borrowings and minimising costs of capital.
Close control of deployment of capital is maintained by detailed management review procedures for authorisation of significant capital commitments, such as land acquisition, capital targets for local management and a system of internal interest recharges, ensuring capital cost impact is understood and considered by all management tiers.
Decisions regarding the balance of equity and borrowings, dividend policy and all major borrowing facilities are reserved for the Board.
The Group is currently pursuing a strategy of capital return to shareholders, whilst at the same time building a stronger, larger business.
Full details are available in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 49.

In all but a minority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements not applicable to the Company.
The pressures of market conditions during recessionary periods necessitated an increase in this form of sales structure from 2008.
In such cases the long term debt is secured upon the property concerned.
There were no significant indicators of impairment on these assets at 31 December 2016.
The Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Reductions in property values leads to an increase in the credit risk of the Group in respect of such sales.
There was 0.7m requirement fora charge in relation to credit impairment in the year 2015: 0.5m.
The maximum total credit risk is as follows: 2016 2015 Group m m Trade and other receivables 108.9 94.7 Available for sale financial assets 148.7 177.9 Cash and cash equivalents 913.0 570.4 1,170.6 843.0 Company Loans and receivables including intercompany balances 1,275.2 1,026.5 Cash and cash equivalents 711.4 442.5 1,986.6 1,469.0 The maximum credit exposure of the Group to overseas parties is under 0.1m 2015: under 0.1m Company: nil 2015: nil.

The maximum credit risk should any single party excepting financial institutions fail to perform is 4.0m 2015: 3.9m and is not yet due Company: 664.2m 2015: 446.2m being a subsidiary debtor.
The Directors consider these financial assets to be of high quality and the credit risk is assessed as low.
The maximum credit risk associated with a financial institution in respect of short term cash deposits is 220.5m 2015: 125.8m.

They are carried at fair value.
The fair value is determined by reference to the rates at which they could be exchanged by knowledgeable and willing parties.
Fair value is determined by discounting forecast cash flows for the residual period of the contract byarisk adjusted rate.
There exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final valuation and timing of cash flows arising from these assets.
As a result the Group has applied inputs based on current market conditions and the Groups historic experience of actual cash flows resulting from such arrangements.
These inputs are by nature estimates and as such the fair value has been classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy laid out in IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement.
Significant unobservable inputs into the fair value measurement calculation include regional house price movements based on the Groups actual experience of regional house pricing and management forecasts of future movements, weighted average duration of the loans from inception to settlement of ten years 2015: ten years and discount rate 8% 2015: 8% based on current observed market interest rates offered to private individuals on secured second loans.
The discounted forecast cash flow calculation is dependent upon the estimated future value of the properties on which the available for sale financial assets are secured.
Adjustments to this input, which might result from a change in the wider property market, would have a proportional impact upon the fair value of the asset.

Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 12 2 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Retirement benefit assets As at 31 December 2016 the Group operated four employee pension schemes, being two Group personal pension schemes and two defined benefit pension schemes.
Remeasurement gains and losses in the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full as other comprehensive expense income within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
All other pension scheme costs are reported in profit or loss.
Group personal pension schemes The Group makes contributions to the Group personal pension schemes which are open to employees who are not members of the defined benefit schemes.
Dependent upon an employees role and length of service the Group may make contributions to the schemes of up to a maximum of 9% of basic salary.
The Group has no liability beyond these contributions.
Group contributions to these schemes of 1.7m 2015: 1.6m are expensed through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme The Persimmon Plc Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Persimmon Scheme is a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members in 2001.
Active members of the Persimmon Scheme accrue benefits on a career average related earnings basis.
The assets of the Persimmon Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
On 12 December 2012 Persimmon Plc made a one-off cash contribution of 57.8m to the Persimmon Scheme.
The Persimmon Scheme used these funds to invest in Persimmon Scottish Limited Partnership, which has undertaken to provide fixed cash payments to the Persimmon Scheme to meet its liabilities over a 15 year period.
See note 28 for further details.
Prowting Pension Scheme The Group also operates the Prowting Pension Scheme the Prowting Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
Active members of the Prowting Scheme accrue benefits on a career average related earnings basis.
The assets of the Prowting Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
Role of Trustees Both the Persimmon Scheme and the Prowting Scheme jointly the Pension Schemes are managed by Trustees who are legally separate from the Company.
The Trustees are composed of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees.
The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy plus the day to day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the Pension Schemes see below.
Funding requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently i. e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
The last funding valuation of the Persimmon Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 1 January 2014 and as at 31 March 2015 for the Prowting Scheme.
The next funding valuations will be as at 1 January 2017 for the Persimmon Scheme which is in progress and will be as at 31 March 2018 for the Prowting Scheme.
Subsequent valuations will be at intervals of no more than three years thereafter.
Following each valuation, the Trustees and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Pension Schemes are fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
Contributions agreed in this manner constitute a minimum funding requirement.
Given the current strength of the Persimmon Schemes funding due to recent cash contributions made to the Persimmon Scheme no deficit contributions are required for that scheme.
However 2.2m p. a. is required for the Prowting Scheme payable to 31 December 2019.
In both cases salary related contributions for active members are also payable.
Under the governing documentation of the Pension Schemes, any future surplus in either scheme would be returnable to the Group by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the schemes.
As a result the Group does not consider there to be an asset ceiling in respect of the Pension Schemes.
The Group has determined that in accordance with the rules of the Pension Schemes the present value of refunds or reductions in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the fair value of funding obligations.
As such no decrease in the defined benefit asset was necessary.
Both Pension Schemes are in a strong funding position.
The Group remains committed to the continuity of this position and will review future contribution levels in the event of any significant deficit arising.
The schemes investment strategy is to maintain a portfolio of suitable assets of appropriate liquidity which will generate investment returns to meet, together with future contributions, the benefits of the members as they fall due.
The schemes do not invest directly in complex financial instruments, though there may be limited indirect investment through investment funds.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 12 3 27 Retirement benefit assets continued Regulation The UK pensions market is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose key statutory objectives in relation to UK defined benefit plans are: to protect the benefits of members to promote, and to improve understanding of good administration to reduce the risk of situations arising which may lead to compensation being payable from the Pension Protection Fund PPF The Pensions Regulator has sweeping powers including the powers: to wind up a scheme where winding up is necessary to protect members interests to appoint or remove a trustee to impose a schedule of company contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions where a trustee and company fail to agree on appropriate contributions to impose a contribution where there has been a detrimental action against a scheme Risks associated with the Pension Schemes The Pension Schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Risk Description Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation DBO is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create an element of deficit.
The Pension Schemes hold a significant proportion c. 50% of assets in growth assets such as equities which, although expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Pension Schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the DBO for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Pension Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, this is capped at an annual increase of 5%.
Life expectancy The majority of the Pension Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
There are a number of other risks of running the Pension Schemes including operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits, legislative risks such as the Government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation and other demographic risks, such as a higher proportion of members having a dependant eligible to receive a survivors pension.
Net Pension Asset The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the Pension Schemes are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Fair value of Pension Scheme assets 605.6 512.0 Present value of funded obligations 582.3 494.0 Net pension asset 23.3 18.0 A deferred tax liability totalling 4.0m 2015: liability of 3.2m has been recognised on the balance sheet in relation to the net pension asset.

As such the Partnership is included in the consolidated results of the Group.
The Partnership has taken advantage of the exemptions in the Partnerships Accounts regulations 2008 not to file separate accounts onthis basis.

Under IAS 19 the partnership interest of the Persimmon Scheme is included within the UK pension scheme assets.
The Partnership is the beneficial owner of a bond secured on a proportion of the Groups available for sale financial assets and guaranteed by Persimmon Plc, which will support the Partnership investment return to the Persimmon Scheme.
29 Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share option schemes, the details of which are provided below.
All schemes are equity settled.

Options can normally beexercised three years after the date of grant.
Options have been issued to senior management including the Executive Directors under the Groups various executive share option schemes, which include awards under the Groups long term incentive plans.
Future vesting of options is dependent upon return of cash to shareholders in line with the Capital Return Plan announced on 28 February 2012 for options granted in 2012 to 2016 under thePersimmon Plc 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan.
