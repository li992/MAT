Other financial assets continued Other receivables The Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, and are to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
