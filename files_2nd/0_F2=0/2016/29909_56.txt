MBK Partners, the purchasers, considering this potential interpretation, withheld and paid capital gains tax of 325m from the sale proceeds to entirely eliminate any possible challenge against the purchasers by the Korean tax authorities.
In addition, a further provision of 271m has been made for potential additional capital gains tax on the disposal.
The Group intends to vigorously contest this interpretation through the Korean legal process.
To this end, the Group has filed a claim for a refund of the capital gains tax withheld by the purchasers.
The Korean National Tax Service have commenced an investigation into this claim.
It is anticipated the full Korean legal process could take four to five years.
