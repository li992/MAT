Risk management Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risks within the Company derive from non-payment of loan balances.
However, as the balances are receivable from subsidiary companies the risk of default is considered minimal.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Company balance sheet largely comprises illiquid assets in the form of investments in subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries, which have been used to finance property investment and development activities.
Accordingly the realisation of these assets may take time and may not achieve the values at which they are carried in the balance sheet.
The Companys other assets are cash of 5.2 million 31 March 2015: 1.0 million.
The Company had trade and other payables of 1.5 million at 31 March 2016 31 March 2015: nil.
There are no differences between the book value of cash and trade payables, nor is there any meaningful interest rate sensitivity.
