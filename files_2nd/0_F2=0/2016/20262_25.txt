Financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the year to 30 September 2016 1 Segmental disclosures The Group operates a single business segment of asset management for reporting and control purposes.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosures to reflect the information which the Group management board GMB, being the body that is the Groups chief operating decision maker, uses for evaluating performance and the allocation of resources.
The Group is managed as a single asset management business, with multiple investment strategies of equities, fixed income and property, complemented by a solutions business which provides multi asset, alternatives and quantitative investment capabilities.
These strategies are managed across a range of products, distribution channels and geographic regions.
Reporting provided to the GMB is on an aggregated basis.
Under IFRS 8, the Group is required to disclose by geographical location revenue and amounts of non-current assets other than financial instruments, deferred tax assets and retirement benefit assets.
Revenue below is allocated by geographical location based on where the assets are managed and the location of client service teams.

The tax rate was reduced from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 and a further reduction to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and then to 18% effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
The effective tax charge borne by the Company and its UK subsidiaries will reduce accordingly in future years.
All UK deferred tax assets and liabilities that will unwind in the future have been recognised at an average rate of 19%, which has been calculated based on the future rates which will apply at the estimated dates of unwinding.
com 109 Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Tax expense continued Factors affecting future tax charge The Groups overseas profits are subject to the tax rates which apply in relevant jurisdictions, some of which are lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
Non-UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2016 have also been calculated based on the rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.

110 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Benefits Trust see note 22.
Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring and acquisition-related items.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of these non-cash or one-off items.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators that the carrying value may be impaired.
Definite life intangibles are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
If any indication exists, further assessment is made of whether the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment testing is an area involving management judgement requiring assessment as to whether i there is an impairment indicator and, if so, ii the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.
There are a number of assumptions to determine the estimated recoverable amount.
For goodwill, we assess the recoverable amount by considering the Group's market capitalisation, external valuations prepared by analysts and our internal models.
We use internal models for other intangibles.
Assumptions include the selection of market growth rates, discount rates, assets under management flow assumptions, expected revenue growth and operating costs.
Further detail on these assumptions is shown on page 114. aberdeen-asset.
com 113 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use five year cash flow projections based on the Groups approved budget for the year to 30 September 2017.
The 2017 budget reflects the impact of outflows from this year, as well as any mitigating actions.
It is prepared on a bottom up basis and the growth rates below are average rates applied to the forecasts in later years.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows within the value-in-use calculations beyond the initial five year projections.
The long-term growth rate assumption of 2% is in line with the long-term nature of the Groups business and in line with the Boards view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long term.
The other principal assumptions in the forecasts for the periods beyond these covered by the budget: 2016 2015 % % Average annual increase in assets under management 5.0 3.8 Average annual increase in operating costs 3.0 3.0 The assumed annual increases in operating costs include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increased levels of business.
The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate to estimate a market rate relevant to the sector and associated risks.
2016 2016 2015 2015 Post tax Pre tax Post tax Pre tax % % % % Discount rate 10.83 12.44 11.22 12.91 The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The assumptions are derived from past experience and consideration of current market inputs.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis and without the effect of that change on other variables, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the value-in-use to the carrying value of goodwill were as follows: 2016 2015 % % Discount rate - pre tax 19.5 19.7 Revenue growth rate 1.5 2.7 Operating cost growth rate 13.2 12.6 The value-in-use, calculated in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying values of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment.
The comparison resulted in a surplus of value-in-use of 1,562 million 2015: 1,414 million over the carrying value of these assets and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.
114 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Management contracts and distribution agreements The Group reviewed the management contracts and distribution agreements held at 30 September 2016 including 79.3 million 2015: 79.3 million of management contracts which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These indefinite life assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The Group also reviewed definite life assets for impairment indicators and performed impairment tests where required.
Impairment tests were performed using either value-in-use calculations using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill or estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as considered appropriate, and the measures of value compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
An impairment charge of 7.7 million was recognised in the year to 30 September 2016 in relation to Artio management contacts following outflows in the global high yield and total return bond products.
The categories of management contracts and distribution agreements, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2016 30 September 2015 Net book Remaining Estimated Net book Remaining Estimated values amortisation useful life values amortisation useful life m period years years m period years years Definite life - management contracts 388.8 1-7 3-9 455.8 1-7 5-9 Indefinite life - open end fund contracts 79.3 N A Indefinite 79.3 N A Indefinite 468.1 535.1 The definite life management contracts include those acquired in 2014 as part of the SWIP acquisition, which have a net book value of 227.5 million at 30 September 2016 2015: 291.4 million, together with the contracts acquired from Credit Suisse in 2009 which have a net book value of 62.2 million 2015: 80.6 million.
Intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives.
This shall not exceed the period of the contractual rights but may be shorter depending on the period over which the entity expects to use the asset.
There is a judgement in assessing these lives including assessment of client retention.
We have typically assessed these to be between 5 and 10 years looking at each acquisition on a case by case basis.
Factors considered include size of book of business, market and growth prospects and nature of investments managed under the contracts.
Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as the Group review described above.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
At 30 September 2016, the Company held indefinite life open end fund contracts with a value of 3.4 million 2015: 3.4 million.
com 115 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 Acquisitions Acquisitions 2016 a.
On 29 December 2015, the Group completed the purchase of Advance Emerging Capital Ltd Advance, a London based specialist investment manager.
Total cash consideration for the transaction was 14.6 million.
In the period to 30 September 2016, Advance added revenue of 2.6 million and profit before tax of 1.5 million.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 October 2015, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have increased by 3.5 million, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would have increased by 2.0 million.
In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2015.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.1 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition-related costs see note 4. b.
On 31 December 2015, the Group completed the purchase of Arden Capital Management LLC Arden, a hedge fund solutions business with offices in New York and London.
Total consideration for this transaction was 11.2 million $16.6 million, comprising cash consideration of 10.4 million $15.3 million and contingent consideration of 0.8 million under an earn-out agreement.
The fair value of the earn-out at completion was 0.8 million, determined by the probability weighted expected return and growth over the period from acquisition to 31 December 2019, subject to a maximum of 49 million $73 million, and discounted to a present value.
The undiscounted fair values identified in this analysis range from 1.5 million to 8.9 million.
The deferred liability is 1.0 million at 30 September 2016.
In the period to 30 September 2016, Arden added revenue of 6.3 million and profit before tax of 0.1 million.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 October 2015, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have increased by 9.4 million, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would have increased by 0.9 million.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.2 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition-related costs see note 4.
The acquisition of Advance and Arden are in line with the Groups strategy to strengthen our alternatives capabilities.
c. On 11 January 2016, the Group completed the purchase of Parmenion Capital Partners LLP and its sister company, Self Directed Holdings Limited together Parmenion, a Bristol based provider of risk graded portfolios to UK financial advisers through a digital platform.
Total consideration for this transaction was 50.2 million, comprising cash consideration of 40.1 million and contingent consideration of 10.1 million under an earn-out.
The fair value of the earn-out at completion was 10.1 million, determined by the probability weighted expected return and growth over the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017, subject to a maximum of 16.8 million, and discounted to a present value.
The undiscounted fair values identified in this analysis range from 8.0 million to 16.8 million.
After the impact of unwinding the discount to date of 1.1 million, the deferred liability is 11.2 million at 30 September 2016.
The acquisition is in line with the Groups strategy to capitalise on advancements in financial technology systems and to become a leader in using technology to provide investors with portfolios appropriate to their needs, whilst also developing the channels for the distribution of multi asset investment capabilities.
In the period to 30 September 2016, Parmenion added revenue of 7.6 million and profit before tax of 0.9 million.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 October 2015, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have increased by 10.1 million, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would have increased by 1.2 million.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.6 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition-related costs see note 4. d. Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets acquired in these transactions.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the following table.
Goodwill is mainly attributable to the skills of the workforce acquired and the synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisitions.
The fair value of intangible assets has been based on the present value of expected cash flows of the underlying management contracts, with the exception of 11.6 million internally developed software for Parmenion which is based on managements best estimate of replacement cost.

On 31 August 2015, the Group completed the purchase of FLAG Capital Management, LLC FLAG, a manager of private equity and real asset solutions with offices in Stamford USA, Boston USA, and Hong Kong.
Total consideration for the transaction was 62.6 million $96.2 million comprising cash consideration of 52.0 million $80 million and contingent deferred consideration of 10.6 million under an earn-out agreement.
The fair value of the earn-out at completion was 10.6 million, determined by the probability weighted expected return and growth over the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017, subject to a maximum of 29.3 million $45 million, and discounted to a present value.
The undiscounted fair values identified in this analysis range from 1.3 million to 29.3 million.
The fair value of the earn out has been subsequently measured: after unwinding the year to date discount and impact of foreign exchange of 3.9 million 2015: 0.3 million, the deferred liability is 14.8 million 2015: 10.9 million.
This acquisition is in line with the Groups strategy to strengthen and grow its global alternatives platform and solutions capabilities and FLAGs well-established private equity teams in the U. S. and Asia help broaden the Groups existing solutions business.
The acquired business added approximately 39.5 million of intangible assets and goodwill of 22.4 million arose on completion of an independent valuation see below.
In the one month to September 2015, FLAG added revenue of 1.6 million and profit before tax of 0.6 million.
However, if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2014, we estimate that consolidated revenues would have been increased by a further 21.5 million, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would have been increased by 4.9 million.
In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2014.
Acquisition-related costs of 2.3 million were incurred and have been included in acquisition costs see note 4. b.
Independent valuation specialists were engaged to carry out a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets acquired in this transaction.
The fair value adjustments from this allocation process are reflected in the table on the following page.
Goodwill is mainly attributable to the skills of the workforce acquired and the synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition.
The valuation of intangibles and the determination of useful economic lives determined at the point of acquisitions are significant accounting estimates.
Intangible assets are valued based on forecast income streams from the management contracts.
This includes assumptions on client attrition and markets.
Valuation of the earn-out agreements and recognition over the term are also significant accounting estimates.
This is discussed further in note 27.
The determination of useful economic lives is discussed in note 13.
118 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements c. The fair value of the intangible assets has been based on the present value of expected cash flows of the underlying management contracts.

On 30 June 2015, the Group completed its purchase of the remaining 49.9% stake in the UK joint venture, Aberdeen Private Equity Managers Limited SVGM, from SVG Capital plc SVGC for cash consideration of 29 million.
The Group originally acquired a 50.1% stake in May 2013 with the option of acquiring the remaining 49.9% stake for which a deferred liability of 35 million was recognised at acquisition, discounted to 27.5 million.
SVGM generated revenues of 17.9 million 2014: 28.8 million and profit after tax of 6.6 million 2014: 10.7 million, of which 3.3 million 2014: 5.4 million was allocated to non-controlling interest prior to acquisition of the remaining stake.
At acquisition, the Group recognised a decrease in non-controlling interest of 36.5 million, a decrease in retained earnings of 8.9 million and a reduction of 27.5 million in the put option reserve.

When such circumstances arise, the Board considers the likelihood of a material outflow of economic resources and provides for its best estimate of costs where an outflow of economic resources is considered probable.
By their nature, provisions often reflect significant levels of judgement or estimate.
While there can be no assurances, the directors believe, based on information currently available to them, that the likelihood of other material outflows is remote.
The Company had no provisions or contingent liabilities at 30 September 2016 2015: nil.

com 131 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Fair value of financial instruments continued Further details of the above financial instruments, including the principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values, are provided below: Investments Seed capital investments consist of amounts invested to enable the launch or development of funds where the intention is to withdraw the investment once the fund has achieved a sustainable scale of third party investment.
The Group also holds investments in certain Aberdeen-managed funds to hedge against liabilities from variable pay awards that are deferred and settled in cash by reference to the share price of those funds.
Other investments, including holdings in property and infrastructure funds, are typically longer term and measured as available for sale.
Where investments are listed, fair value is based on market bid prices at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs.
Conversely, the fair value of unlisted investments is determined in accordance with independent professional valuers or International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines where relevant.
The fair value of unlisted investments in infrastructure funds is based on the phase of individual projects forming the overall investment and discounted cash flow techniques based on project earnings.
Third party interest in consolidated funds The Group recognises a third party interest in seed capital investments where the Group is deemed to have control, in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The fair value of the third party interest is deemed on the same basis as the investments listed above.
Financial instruments relating to investment contract liabilities The Groups life and pensions subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which allow clients to benefit from investing in pooled funds.
The following assets are held by the subsidiary to meet its contracted liabilities: 2016 2015 Group m m 1,258.3 Listed investments 1,662.2 358.8 Unit trusts and OEICs 220.2 47.0 Cash, deposits and liquidity funds 34.8 6.5 Other net assets 8.9 1,670.6 1,926.1 The risks and rewards of these assets fall to the benefit of, or are borne by, the underlying policyholders, consistent with other assets under management.
Therefore, the investment contract liabilities shown in the Group's balance sheet are equal and opposite in value to the assets held on behalf of the policyholders.
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of assets which are held on behalf of policyholders, nor to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default.
The Group's exposure to these assets is limited to the revenue earned, which varies according to movements in the value of the assets.
Accordingly, these assets are not included in the fair value measurements disclosure on page 133.
Derivative financial instruments In limited circumstances, the Group enters into short term forward foreign exchange and equity futures contracts to hedge its exposure to associated risks in relation to seed capital investments.
Open forward foreign exchange contracts are valued using forward rates of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date for the remaining period until maturity, and are settled on a gross basis.
Open futures contracts are valued at the exchange quoted price at close of business on the balance sheet date.
Deferred contingent consideration The Group recognises a liability for performance related earn-out payments in connection with acquisitions see note 14.
The fair value of each earn-out is determined by the probability weighted expected return and growth over the period of the earn-out, discounted to present value.
132 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements The valuation of deferred contingent consideration involves significant accounting judgement around assessing the fair value of that liability.
Deferred contingent consideration is valued based on forecast revenues appropriate to each earn-out agreement.
This includes assumptions based on revenue growth to date, market performance, the probability of returns and the appropriate discount rate.
The fair value of each earn-out is reviewed against each associated performance criteria at least annually, with changes in fair value and the unwind of the discount recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of the deferred contingent consideration payable to Lloyds at 30 September 2016 is 18.1 million 2015: 35.9 million.
Growth in flows into Lloyds wealth portfolios managed by the multi asset team formerly investment solutions has been lower than originally anticipated and therefore the fair value has been further reduced by 17.8 million to 18.1 million at 30 September 2016 2015: 24.4 million reduction to 35.9 million.
However, the actual amount payable will be determined by the performance and growth over the 5 year period to 31 March 2019.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are typically settled in a short time frame and are carried at the amount due to be settled.
As a result, the fair value of these balances is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value, after taking into account potential impairment losses.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: Level 1 measurements are derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Seed capital and other investments, including associated third party interests, of 27.1 million, deemed not to have been actively traded, were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year.
There were no other transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 investments during the year.
Investments classified as Level 3 principally comprise investments in property and infrastructure funds.
While the Group is not aware of significant differences between valuations received and reasonable possible alternatives for the property funds, the value of these investments would be directly impacted by changes in the European and Asian property markets.
The fair value of the infrastructure funds would be impacted by a number of factors described on page 132.
The Group estimates that a 10% increase decrease in the fair value of the investments will have a favourable unfavourable impact on equity of 4.4 million, of which 2.0 million relates to investments in infrastructure funds.
The fair value of the earn-out agreements included in Level 3 is determined based on a number of unobservable inputs, details of which are provided above.
A change in one or more of these inputs could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.
On a standalone basis, without the impact of those changes on other variables, changes in the discount rate of - 1% would have an impact of approximately 0.6 million and a change in revenue growth of - 10% would have an impact of approximately 9.0 million on the fair value of the earn-outs respectively.
134 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 28 Financial risk management Overview This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
i Risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: market price risk: foreign exchange risk: and interest rate risk.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Groups risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the Boards policies are handled by the risk management committee.
The Board risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Board has approved the risk appetite statement, which sets out the quantum and types of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its objectives.
The risk appetite statement is a top-down framework against which policies, systems and limits can be set.
The risk committee monitors compliance with the risk appetite statement through a series of key performance indicators.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reports and internal control.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accrued income and derivative financial instruments.
As detailed in note 27, the carrying value of financial instruments approximate their fair value.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of its financial assets.
A breakdown of the Groups relevant financial assets by external credit rating is set out below.
1 As at 30 September 2016 As at 30 September 2015 restated Not Not AAA AA A BBB BB rated Total AAA AA A BBB BB rated Total Group m m m m m m m m m m m m m m 2 Cash and cash equivalents 9.9 536.0 279.7 15.4 3.2 3.7 847.9 12.3 607.2 290.0 9.6 0.5 2.7 922.3 Derivative financial assets 29.2 0.4 29.6 Deposits receivable from brokers on derivative contracts 5.6 5.6 Company Cash and cash equivalents 148.1 148.1 252.2 0.1 252.3 Derivative financial assets 29.2 0.4 29.6 Deposits receivable from brokers on derivative contracts 5.6 5.6 No other relevant financial assets are rated.
1 Restated to reflect gross position for cash pooling arrangements see note 19.
2 Excludes the Group overdraft which forms part of a Group cash pooling facility and carries a credit rating of AA 2015: AA.
com 135 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Groups treasury policy as approved by the audit committee.
The treasury function manages the cash resources on a daily basis in accordance with the treasury policy, which includes continuously monitoring the credit ratings of all institutions with whom we place deposits.
Similarly, the Group adopts a conservative approach to managing the credit risk from derivatives through the use of exchange traded futures which are fully collateralised in cash, and forward foreign exchange contracts, which typically have a maturity of three months.
Trade receivables and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
The credit quality of outstanding balances is monitored locally by senior management.
Historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.
As such, there are no concerns over the credit quality of these assets and no significant level of default is expected.
An analysis of ageing of financial assets is shown below: As at 30 September 2016 As at 30 September 2015 Past due and not impaired Past due and not impaired Neither Neither past Between Between past Between Between due nor 30 and 90 days due nor 30 and 90 days impaired 90 days and 1 year Total impaired 90 days and 1 year Total m m m m m m m m Group Trade receivables 29.2 5.2 1.3 35.7 26.5 11.0 5.1 42.6 Company Trade receivables 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.2 All other financial assets are neither past due nor impaired.
Details of provisions against trade receivables at 30 September are as follows: 2016 2015 Group m m Trade receivables provision: Balance at 1 October 0.2 Bad debt release in the year 0.2 Balance at 30 September Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
The average level of debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, represents approximately 2 months revenue.
At 30 September 2016 the Group had two 2015: four individual clients with greater than 1 million outstanding.
The total outstanding was 12.2 million 2015: 19.0 million.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
Very few clients have external credit ratings.
The Group manages a number of open end funds and, in doing so, the relevant subsidiary acts as agent i in settling to investors, on behalf of the fund, the proceeds due on redemption of fund shares by investors: and ii in collecting, on behalf of the fund, the consideration due on subscriptions by investors for new shares in the funds.
The Group has the right of recovery from the trustee for i and the client for ii in the event of a default.
136 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Further details on liquidity risks are set out in the discussion of principal risks on pages 42 to 49.
The Group has cash balances of 549 million, net of an overdraft of 299 million 2015: 355 million.
In addition, the Group has a separate 20 million overdraft facility and 120 million of revolving credit facilities, both of which were undrawn at 30 September 2016.
These cash balances and credit facilities provide the Group with adequate liquidity.
The Group and Company financial liabilities are repayable within one year or on demand, with the exception of the earn-out agreements see note 14 and overdraft.
The Group and Company overdraft form part of a Group cash pooling facility which does not allow for a net overdrawn position see note 19.
As such, there is no significant liquidity risk attached to the overdraft.
The periods over which the earn-outs are payable and associated undiscounted liabilities are set out below: Group Company Maximum payment 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m Earn-out payments due m m 30.8 12.9 Within 1 - 2 years 51.4 15.4 22.7 22.7 Up to 3 years 100.0 45.5 45.5 1.7 Within 3 - 4 years 56.2 55.2 35.6 207.6 60.9 45.5 The Group has made a commitment to invest up to 46.3 million 2015: 28.8 million in infrastructure funds, denominated in several currencies.
27.3 million of this amount remains committed but not yet drawn 2015: 20.4 million.
Investment calls can be made on demand primarily over the investment periods of the partnerships.
These periods are due to expire within one to three years time.
Once drawn, committed capital remains invested for the life of the funds.
The Group also has undrawn commitments of 44.9 million 2015: 18.2 million in respect of investments in property and private equity funds, which can be called on demand.
iv Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
These financial instruments include the Groups investments in seed capital, property and infrastructure funds.
Seed capital is typically invested in quoted funds for less than one year and is measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments in property and infrastructure funds are usually for longer term and are measured as available for sale.
This can range from five to seven years for property and over ten years for infrastructure.
Investments are managed on an individual basis and all material buy and sell decisions are approved by the GMB.
The objective of market price risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Board sets the limits for investing seed capital and longer-term investments and regularly monitors the exposure.
The following financial assets are exposed to market risk: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Held for trading Seed capital 200.6 148.9 138.0 102.9 Financial investments 54.0 43.7 53.7 43.4 Available for sale financial assets Financial investments 46.4 34.6 26.3 13.0 301.0 227.2 218.0 159.3 In addition, of the 34.9 million third party interest in consolidated funds 2015: 4.6 million, 12.6 million is exposed to changes in market prices 2015: 4.6 million.
The Group will consider hedging its exposure to market price risk in respect of seed capital investments, where there is a risk of material price movements and the risk can be hedged effectively.
No seed capital was hedged against movements in market prices at 30 September 2016 2015: 25.3 million.
com 137 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued The Groups defined benefit pension schemes also hold assets which are exposed to market price risk.
Details of these assets are shown in note 31.
Sensitivity analysis is disclosed on page 141 to 143, in section vii.
v Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk at a transactional and translational level.
Transaction risk is the risk that the domestic value of a foreign currency denominated cash flow will vary adversely.
Translation risk arises from translating the balances of overseas subsidiaries which report their results in a currency other than sterling and therefore the sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Foreign currency transaction risk The Group undertakes transactions in a number of currencies and foreign currency risk arises through fluctuations in foreign currency rates changing the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.
Revenues are earned principally from fees which are calculated on the basis of the value of AuM managed for clients and many mandates include investments valued in currencies other than sterling.
The fact that we operate on a global basis, with offices in a number of countries worldwide, means that a proportion of operating costs is also incurred in foreign currencies.
Further, coupons on the 7.0% perpetual cumulative capital notes are paid in US dollars.
Variations in the sterling value of these operating costs and dividends will, to an extent, offset any similar impact of fluctuating exchange rates on revenues.
The Board has therefore decided that it is not appropriate to undertake any specific hedging of the Groups revenues or costs.
At 30 September 2015, we held one forward foreign exchange contract in respect of an investment in seed capital.

Interest on the undrawn facility is at the Bank of Englands Sterling Base Rate, plus a margin.
The Group has no other drawn debt and is therefore not materially exposed to interest rate risk.
The Company also has revolving credit facilities in place which were undrawn at 30 September 2016.
Interest on the revolving credit facilities, which have been undrawn throughout the year, is at LIBOR plus a margin.

vii Sensitivity analysis The following analysis provides an indication of the impact of changes in the significant market risk variables on the fair value and cash flows of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: market prices are assumed to increase or decrease by 10%: and market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% at each reporting date.
com 141 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued The impact of the assumptions on profit or loss and equity, net of tax, are as follows: Group Impact on Impact on profit or profit or Impact on Impact on loss loss equity equity As at 30 September 2016 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 26.3 26.3 19.0 19.0 Sterling Euro 11.2 11.2 4.8 4.8 Sterling Nordic currencies 1.5 1.5 1.2 1.2 Sterling Singapore dollar 9.4 9.4 13.1 13.1 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 16.8 16.8 Financial investments available for sale 3.8 3.8 Third party interest in consolidated funds 1.1 1.1 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 3.8 3.8 As at 30 September 2015 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 17.4 17.4 19.8 19.8 Sterling Euro 8.8 8.8 4.5 4.5 Sterling Nordic currencies 1.2 1.2 0.9 0.9 Sterling Singapore dollar 8.7 8.7 11.9 11.9 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 10.7 10.7 Financial investments available for sale 2.6 2.6 Third party interest in consolidated funds 0.4 0.4 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 5.1 5.1 Changes in the Group's profit or loss and equity as a result of exchange rate movements are mainly driven by cash, seed capital and trade and other receivables payables balances denominated in the currencies listed above.
The market price movement sensitivity excludes investments in funds to hedge deferred variable pay liabilities, as described in note 27.
Changes in the market price of these investments are offset by movements in deferred variable pay liabilities, therefore there is no impact on profit or loss.
This also applies to the Company.
The Group and Company interest rate movement sensitivity has been calculated based on average cash balances held during the year.
142 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements The 2015 sensitivity for market and exchange rate movements for the Group excludes the derivative financial instruments and related seed capital, as described in note 27.
The change in the derivative financial instruments is offset by movements in the related seed capital investments and therefore there is no material impact on profit or loss.
This does not apply to the Company as the seed capital was held in another Group subsidiary.
The effect of the derivative financial instruments is reflected in the Company sensitivity analysis in the following table: Company Impact on Impact on profit or profit or Impact on Impact on loss loss equity equity As at 30 September 2016 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 9.4 9.4 Sterling Euro 4.0 4.0 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments held for trading 11.5 11.5 Financial investments available for sale 2.1 2.1 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 2.4 2.4 As at 30 September 2015 Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency 1 Sterling US dollar 0.9 0.9 Sterling Euro 1.6 1.6 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% 2 Financial investments held for trading 6.5 6.5 Financial investments available for sale 0.9 0.9 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Market interest rates 1.6 1.6 1 Excluding forward foreign exchange contracts, the 2015 profit or loss impact would be -3.2 million.
2 Excluding equity futures, the 2015 profit or loss impact would be -8.6 million.
Changes in the Company's profit or loss as a result of exchange rate movements are mainly driven by seed capital and other investments denominated in the currencies listed above, and non-sterling intercompany loans, as described in note 29. aberdeen-asset.
com 143 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued viii Capital management The Boards policy with respect to capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to provide a sufficient base to sustain the future development of the business while at the same time ensuring compliance with all regulatory capital requirements.
The Board receives regular updates on headroom over regulatory capital and supervises key decisions that may impact the future capital position of the Group.
Further information on the Groups regulatory capital position is given below.
The Groups capital structure consists of equity share capital and share premium of 1,030.5 million, retained earnings, US$500 million perpetual capital notes and 100 million preference shares.
The perpetual capital notes and preference shares satisfy the requirements of financial reporting standards for treatment as equity and the perpetual capital notes are treated as an element of Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.
The preference shares are treated as Additional Tier 1 capital.
The Group uses cash generated from its operations to pay a progressive dividend.
The Board seeks to avoid further dilutive issuance of new shares and has, since 2010, satisfied vesting of deferred variable pay awards by purchasing shares in the market through the EBT.
The EBT now holds sufficient shares to cover all outstanding awards as at 30 September 2016.
Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD IV, as implemented in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital.
The Group is required to undertake an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, under which the Board quantifies the level of capital required to meet operational risks: this is referred to as the Pillar 2 capital requirement.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks which may not be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing for the effects of major risks, such as those discussed on pages 42 to 49.
These tests consider how the Group would cope with a significant market downturn, for example, and include an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
The subsidiary entities may also have regulatory capital requirements.
All subsidiaries maintained compliance within all such requirements during the year.
29 Related party transactions In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiary undertakings carry out transactions with related parties, as defined by IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Material transactions for the year are set out below.

com 145 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Interests in structured entities A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group has assessed whether the funds it manages are structured entities, through review of the above factors.
The Group considers the following as structured entities Open Ended Investment Companies OEICs, Socits dInvestissement Capital Variable SICAVs, Unit Trusts, Fonds Communs fide Placement FCPs, and certain mutual funds, limited partnerships and other pooled funds.
Segregated mandates managed on behalf of clients and investment trusts are not considered structured entities.
The structured entities are generally financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors, although certain funds, mainly property, infrastructure and private equity funds, are also permitted to raise finance through loans from third parties.
The Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings held by these entities.
The structured entities allow clients to invest in a portfolio of assets in order to provide a return through capital appreciation and or investment income.
Accordingly, they are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the assets they hold.
Market risks are discussed further in note 28.
In certain cases, the Group will also purchase units or shares for the purpose of providing seed capital or to hedge against liabilities from deferred variable pay awards.
There are no differences in the rights attached to the equity held by the Group from those held by other investors.
As described in note 28, the Group may also commit to invest capital in certain property, infrastructure and private equity funds.
AuM within consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities is shown below: 2016 AuM 2015 AuM Type of entity bn bn 1 Consolidated structured entities Seed capital investments 0.1 0.1 Assets backing investment contract liabilities 1.7 1.9 Unconsolidated structured entities: Open-ended funds 63.9 71.7 Closed-end funds 8.9 3.2 Outside of structured entities 237.5 206.8 Total AuM 312.1 283.7 1 Includes AuM in relation to funds the Group is deemed to control through seed capital investments which are consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10, and the assets held by the Groups life and pensions subsidiary to meet its contracted liabilities.
The exposure to the risks and rewards of the assets held by the Groups life and pensions subsidiary is borne by the underlying policyholders see note 27.
The Group has an interest in the structured entities listed above through the receipt of management fees based on a percentage of the net asset value and, in certain funds, contractually agreed performance fees, as well as investment returns where the Group has an equity holding in the entity.
Gross revenue includes 529.1 million of fees received from structured entities managed by the Group 2015: 655.3 million, of which 462.2 million 2015: 573.5 million relates to related parties.
In addition, gains on investments see note 8 includes a net gain on seed capital and other investments held in structured entities of 22.7 million during the year 2015: 9.4 million loss.

146 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Maximum exposure to loss The Group does not have a direct exposure to the AuM it manages, with the associated risks and rewards residing with external investors, except where the Group holds an equity interest.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss is therefore limited to future fee income and the carrying value of assets relating to structured entities at each reporting date, as highlighted above, where the net asset value of the entities is reduced through withdrawals by investors and or adverse performance.
In addition, 56.3 million of the Groups unfunded capital commitments described in note 28 iii relates to unconsolidated structured entities invested in property, private equity and infrastructure projects.
Financial support The Group does not ordinary provide financial support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entity through guarantees over the repayment of borrowings, or otherwise.
However, in limited circumstances, the Group will consider supporting structured entities by way of short term financing to manage the timing of cash flows.
At 30 September 2016, this amounted to 0.4 million 2015: nil.
The Group also invested an additional 51.6 million in seed capital during the year to 30 September 2016, in order to support the launch of new funds classified as structured entities.
There are no contractual obligations or current intention of providing further financial support in the future.
31 Retirement benefits The Groups principal form of pension provision is by way of defined contribution schemes operated worldwide.
The Group also operates a small number of legacy defined benefit schemes including: the Murray Johnstone Limited Retirement Benefits Plan, the Edinburgh Fund Managers Group plc Retirement & Death Benefits Scheme and the DEGI Pension Plan.
These defined benefit schemes are closed to new membership and to future service accrual.
The main defined benefit schemes in the UK are based on final salary payments with benefits being adjusted in line with the schemes rules once in payment after retirement.
The level of benefits paid is dependent on a members length of service and salary prior to retirement.
A funding plan, which aims to eliminate any shortfall in funding, has been agreed between the Trustees of the schemes and the employer.
Annual contributions to the UK schemes under these funding plans are currently 8.6 million.
The defined benefit schemes operated by the Group expose the Group to actuarial risks, including longevity risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Where appropriate, the investment strategy takes the make up of the schemes membership into account for example investing in assets that broadly aim to partially match some of the liability outflows, which reduces the effect of market movements on funding levels.
Risk in relation to gilt yields has also been mitigated by investing a proportion of the schemes assets in gilts bonds alternatives.
The total contributions charged to the income statement in respect of the schemes operated by the Group were as follows: 2016 2015 m m Defined contribution schemes 34.3 31.6 Defined benefit schemes 1.2 1.7 Total pension expense 35.5 33.3 The pension deficits are recognised as non-current liabilities in the balance sheet and are stated before deduction of the related deferred tax asset.
The pension surplus is recognised as a non-current asset in the balance sheet and is stated before deduction of the deferred tax liability.
At 30 September 2016 2.5 million 2015: 2.1 million of contributions were outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes.

The buy-in covers all the benefits in respect of the deferred membership as at 9 November 2015 excluding enhanced deferred revaluation in excess of statutory revaluation applied after this date.
From 22 November 2029, L&G will also meet pension and contingent spouses benefits in respect of the pensioner membership as at 9 November 2015.
The insured asset of 71.0 million has been calculated by valuing the estimated benefits that will be paid by the insurer using the 30 September 2016 IAS 19 assumptions and the same approach used to value the year end liabilities.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
