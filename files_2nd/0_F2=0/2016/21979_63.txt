Retirement benefit plans continued In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections of BTPS members benefits: Feature Detail Crown Guarantee The Crown Guarantee was granted by the Government when the group was privatised in 1984 and would only come into effect upon the insolvency of BT.
The Trustee brought court proceedings to clarify the scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee.
The Court of Appeal judgment on 16July 2014 established that: the Crown Guarantee covers BTs funding obligation in relation to members of the Scheme who joined post-privatisation as well as those who joined pre-privatisation subject to certain exceptions : the funding obligation to which the Crown Guarantee relates is measured with reference to BTs obligation to pay deficit contributions under the rules of the Scheme.
The Crown Guarantee is not taken into account for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and is an entirely separate matter, only being relevant in the highly unlikely event that BT became insolvent.
Pension Protection The Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the Scheme and pay benefits not covered by the Crown Guarantee to members.
Fund PPF There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and the PPF would not provide exactly the same benefits as those in the Scheme.
