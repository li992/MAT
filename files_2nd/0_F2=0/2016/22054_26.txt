Significant accounting policies specific to one note are included with that note.
Accounting policies relating to non material items are not included in these financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
This section also includes new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and their expected impact, if any, on the performance of the Group.
1.1 Significant Accounting Policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Cairn Energy PLC Cairn or the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 7 March 2017.
Cairn is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is located at 50 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, Scotland, EH3 9BY.
The registered company number is SC226712.
Cairn prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis, unless accounting standards require an alternate measurement basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed either in the relevant accounting policy or in the notes to the financial statements.
The financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Groups financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the EU, and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the IASB as they apply to accounting periods ended 31 December 2016.
Effective 1 January 2016, Cairn has adopted the following amendments to standards: Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 38 Intangible Assets The adoption of these amendments has had no material impact on Cairns results or financial statement disclosures.
The following new standards issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU have yet to be adopted by the Group: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2018 The adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on Cairns results or financial statement disclosures.
The impact of IFRS 15 shall be further assessed on commencement of production, expected in 2017.
The following new accounting standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued but are not yet effective and have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 2 Share Based Payments effective 1 January 2018 Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows effective 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes effective 1 January 2017 Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2018 The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting the new accounting standards noted above on its audited consolidated financialstatements.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, amendment or interpretation that was issued but is not yet effective.
139 Financial Statements Section 1 Basis of Preparation continued 1.1 Significant Accounting Policies continued c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the balance sheet date.
Where subsidiaries follow differing accounting policies from those of the Group, those accounting policies have been adjusted to align with those of the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, though foreign exchange differences arising on intercompany balances between subsidiaries with differing functional currencies are not offset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in any year are included in the income statement and statement of cash flows from the effective date of acquisition while the results of subsidiaries disposed of during the year are included in the income statement and statement of cash flows to the date at which control passes from the Group.
d Joint arrangements Cairn is a partner joint operator in oil and gas exploration and development licences which are unincorporated joint arrangements.
All of the Groups current interests in these arrangements are determined to be joint operations.
A full list of oil and gas licence interests can be found on pages 177 and 178.
Costs incurred relating to an interest in a joint operation are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies for oil and gas assets as appropriate sections 2.1 and 2.2.
All of the Groups intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development assets are related to interests in joint operations.
Cairns working capital balances relating to joint operations are included in other receivables section 3.3 and trade and other payables section 3.4.
Any share of finance income or costs generated or incurred by the joint operation is included within the appropriate income statement account.
e Foreign currencies These financial statements continue to be presented in US dollars US$, the functional currency of the parent.
In the financial statements of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date or an approximation thereof where not materially different.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the income statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the financial statements of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates subsidiary financial statements into the presentation currency, US$, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for income statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non US$ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to US$1 were as follows: Closing YTD Average Closing YTD Average 2016 2016 2015 2015 Great British Pound 0.811 0.738 0.679 0.654 Norwegian Kroner 8.640 8.395 8.842 8.048 1.2 Going Concern The directors have considered the factors relevant to support a statement of going concern.
In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Board and Audit Committee considered the Group cash flow forecasts under various scenarios, identifying risks and mitigants and ensuring the Group has sufficient funding to meet its current commitments as and when they fall due for a period of 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for this 12-month period and have therefore used the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Board and Audit Committee assessments of risk and mitigants to the Groups operational existence beyond this 12-month period is included in the viability statement on page 40.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 140 Section 2 Assets and Investments: Oil and Gas Assets and Decommissioning Provisions This section focuses on the assets in the balance sheet which form the core of Cairns business.
This section quantifies the financial impact of the operations for the year fully described in the operational review on pages 16 to 21.
Included are details of the appraisal and exploration wells in Senegal, the development projects in the UK North Sea and the impairment reviews and tests performed on the Groups assets.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Impairment testing of oil and gas assets and related goodwill The Groups net book value currently remains in excess of its market value, indicating that the assets may be impaired.
Cairn reduced its long-term oil price assumption to US$70 per boe to reflect ongoing market conditions.
The Groups three-year short-term assumption remains linked to the forward curve.
Impairment tests resulted in impairment charges of US$11.0m against UK North Sea exploration assets in the Greater Catcher area, and US$14.3m on the Spanish Point appraisal prospect in Ireland.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Impairment testing of Intangible exploration appraisal assets and Property, plant & equipment development assets Where an indicator of impairment is identified on an intangible exploration appraisal asset or a development asset, an impairment test is conducted in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The test compares either the carrying value of the asset or the carrying value of the cashgenerating unit CGU containing the asset, to the recoverable amount of that asset or CGU.
The recoverable amount of an asset represents its fair value less costs of disposal.
This is based on either a verifiable third party arms length transaction from which a fair value can be obtained or, where there is no such transaction, the fair value less costs of disposal of an asset is calculated using discounted post-tax cash flow models over the field life of the asset.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow models reflect past experience and take account of external factors.
These assumptions include: Short medium-term oil price based on a three-month average forward curve for three years from the balance sheet date: Long-term oil price of US$70 per boe 2015: US$80 per boe escalated at 2.0% 2015: 2.0% per annum: Reserve estimates of discovered resource 2P and 2C based on P50 reserve estimates: Production profiles based on Cairns internal estimates which are not materially different from those of the operators: Cost profiles for the development of the field and subsequent operating costs supplied by the operator and escalated at 2.0% 2015: 2.0% per annum: and Post-tax discount rates of 10% 2015: 10%.
Impairment testing of goodwill The goodwill arising from past corporate transactions in the UK & Norway region is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying oil and gas assets in the UK & Norway operating segment.
As with the assets above, fair value less costs of disposal are based on discounted post-tax cash flow models where no recent third party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The key assumptions are therefore consistent with those for testing intangible exploration appraisalassets.
Where resource is prospective, fair value represents the expected net present value of the prospect, risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Given the inherent risk associated with exploration activities, valuations of prospective resource are highly subjective.
Decommissioning estimates Provisions for decommissioning are based on the latest estimates provided by operators, subject to review by Cairn and adjustment where deemed necessary.
Costs provided to date are an estimate of the cost that would be incurred to remove and decommission facilities that existed at the year end and to plug and abandon development wells drilled to that date.
Costs are escalated at 2.0% per annum 2015: 2.0% and discounted at a risk-free rate of 2.0% 2015: 2.0%.
141 Financial Statements Section 2 Assets and Investments: Oil and Gas Assets and Decommissioning Provisions continued 2.1 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Accounting policy Cairn follows a  accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area, pre-award costs, are expensed immediately to the income statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, undepleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the income statement.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development assets, after testing for impairment see below.
Proceeds from the disposal or farm down of part or all of an exploration asset are credited initially to that interest with any excess being credited to the income statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
An indicator that one of the Groups assets may be impaired is most likely to be one of the following: There are no further plans to conduct exploration activities in the area: Exploration drilling in the area has failed to discover commercial reserve volumes: Changes in the oil price or other market conditions indicate that discoveries may no longer be commercial: or Development proposals for appraisal assets in the pre-development stage indicate that it is unlikely that the carrying value of the exploration appraisal asset will be recovered in full.
In such circumstances the intangible exploration appraisal asset is allocated to any property, plant & equipment development assets within the same CGU and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the income statement for the year.
Where there are no development assets within the CGU, the excess of the carrying amount of the exploration appraisal asset over its recoverable amount is charged immediately to the income statement.

The four well campaign, which completed in 2016, included the BEL-1 exploration and appraisal well and the additional SNE-2, SNE-3 and SNE-4 appraisal wells.
The successful appraisal programme confirmed the resource base of the SNE-1 discovery made in 2014.
Additions in the year of US$102.1m include US$78.2m of drilling costs associated with the exploration and appraisal wells completed in the period and costs of US$5.4m in preparation for the 2017 appraisal programme which commenced in January 2017 with the SNE-5 appraisal well.
A further US$18.5m of non-well specific exploration costs were incurred in the year.
Capitalised costs of US$330.3m at 31 December 2016 include US$84.6m relating to the FAN-1 discovery of 2014 which has yet to be appraised.
UK & Norway Additions in the current year of US$40.9m include the cost of two exploration wells: one completed in the Greater Catcher Area in the UK North Sea and the second being a farm-in to the unsuccessful Aurelia well in the Norwegian Barents Sea.
Further additions in 2016 relate to the cost of seismic data purchase and ongoing evaluation costs on other licence areas.
The dual prospect well in the Greater Catcher Area encountered commercial volumes of hydrocarbons in the upper Laverda prospect while the deeper Slough prospect was dry.
Costs, therefore, remain capitalised at the year end.
The Aurelia well was unsuccessful and related costs of US$9.9m were charged to the income statement in 2016.
Further unsuccessful costs written off in the year include US$8.4m relating to the Kraken West discovery, drilled in 2015, and US$6.6m on the Grosbeak discovery, south of Skarfjell.
Following further evaluation, neither discovery is now considered to be commercial.
The remaining US$3.3m of unsuccessful costs charged in 2016 relate to other licence interests relinquished in the region.
143 Financial Statements Section 2 Assets and Investments: Oil and Gas Assets and Decommissioning Provisions continued 2.1 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets continued UK & Norway continued During 2015 two wells were drilled: the successful Kraken West appraisal well, noted above, and the unsuccessful Crossbill exploration well.
Unsuccessful costs of US$44.2m were charged to the income statement for 2015: US$23.7m on the relinquished Bonneville satellite discovery, US$12.7m on the Crossbill well and US$7.8m on other exploration licences where no further activity was planned.
Disposal proceeds of US$11.6m in 2015 arose on the farm down of a 10% working interest in the Catcher asset: refer to section 2.3 for further details.
Exploration costs remaining capitalised at the year-end of US$139.7m include costs of US$97.6m relating to discovered resource across two fields: the Norwegian Skarfjell discovery where progress towards development continues, and costs of the Laverda discovery in the UK North Sea.
The remaining US$42.1m of cost has been incurred across 18 of the Groups remaining exploration licences held in the UK and Norwegian North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea.
International Unsuccessful exploration costs of US$42.1m US$57.7m of cost net of impairment of US$15.6m were written off on relinquished licences.
US$31.7m was charged on the C-19 licence, offshore Mauritania and US$7.0m on FEL 1 14 offshore Ireland.
Further costs of US$3.4m were charged on Morocco and Greenland.
Costs remaining at the year-end of US$12.3m include US$5.6m, US$5.8m and US$0.9m on Ireland, Malta and Western Sahara Boujdour Maritime licences respectively.
Impairment review At the year end, Cairn reviewed its intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment.
Indicators were identified where future exploration plans remains uncertain or where the carrying value of assets related to discovered resource may not be fully recovered through future development and production.
Impairment tests identified impairment on the Groups intangible exploration assets, resulting in a charge of US$25.3m to the 2016 income statement.
Of the charge, US$11.0m relates to the Laverda discovery, within the Greater Catcher area, and US$14.3m relates to the Spanish Point appraisal prospect, offshore Ireland, within the International portfolio.
The 2015 charge of US$17.9m included US$16.7m on impairment of satellite fields within the Catcher development area in the UK and Norway region and US$1.2m on Greenland licence costs.
2.2 Property, Plant & Equipment Development Assets Accounting policy Costs All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development assets on a field-by-field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development asset or replaces part of the existing development asset.
Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Costs of borrowings relating to the ongoing construction of development assets and facilities are capitalised during the development phase of the project.
Capitalisation ceases once the asset is ready to commence production.
Net proceeds from any disposal, part disposal or farm down of development assets are credited against the appropriate portion of previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development asset is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the net proceeds, measured at fair value, exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs.
Impairment Development assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Indicators of impairment for the Groups development assets include: Downward revisions of reserve estimates: Increases in cost estimates for development projects: or A decrease in the oil price or other negative changes in market conditions.
Impairment tests are carried out on each development asset at the balance sheet date where an indicator of impairment is identified.
The test compares the carrying value of an asset to its recoverable amount based on the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
Where the fair value less costs of disposal supports the carrying value of the asset, no value-in-use calculation is performed.
If it is not possible to calculate the fair value less costs of disposal of an individual asset, the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated for the CGU containing the asset and tested against the carrying value of the assets and liabilities in the CGU for impairment.
Where an asset can be tested independently for impairment, this test is performed prior to the inclusion of the asset into a CGU for further impairment tests.
If the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is made.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 144 2.2 Property, Plant & Equipment Development Assets continued Accounting policy continued Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the recoverable amount is higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in plugging and abandoning wells, removing subsea installations and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant & equipment development assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset is calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves.
The amortisation of the asset is included in the depletion and decommissioning charge in the income statement and the unwinding of discount of the provision is included within finance costs.

First oil production from the Kraken and Catcher fields is targeted for 2017.
In February 2016 Cairn increased its working interest in Kraken by 4.5% to 29.5%.
The additional interest was acquired from First Oil plc for nominal consideration with Cairn liable for working capital liabilities that existed at the date of the agreement.
US$15.8m is therefore included within additions relating to this increase.
Further additions on the Kraken development were US$165.3m 2015: US$150.9, including an increase of US$26.3m 2015: US$24.5m in the decommissioning asset.
On Catcher, additions during the year of US$95.5m 2015: US$79.7m include US$65.2m 2015: US$70.1m, settled on Cairns behalf by Dyas under the carry agreement detailed below in section 2.3.
Additions also include US$26.5m 2015: US$7.8m for the Catcher decommissioning asset increase.
During 2015, disposals of US$61.2m relate to the farm down of a 10% working interest in Catcher: see section 2.3.
145 Financial Statements Section 2 Assets and Investments: Oil and Gas Assets and Decommissioning Provisions continued 2.3 Gain on Disposal of Oil and Gas Assets In January 2015, Cairn completed the farm down of 10% of the Groups working interest in the Catcher development, satellite fields and surrounding exploration acreage to Dyas.
Under the terms of the deal, Dyas funds Cairns exploration and development costs in respect of the licences up to a cap of US$182.0m, from an effective economic date of 1 January 2014.
On completion of the transaction, Cairn received cash proceeds of US$54.7m US$36.5m under the carry, US$18.2m as a refund of the 10% share of costs from 1 January 2014 and recognised the remaining carry as a receivable at its discounted, post-tax fair value of US$44.7m.
US$11.6m of the proceeds received were allocated to exploration assets and credited against previously capitalised exploration costs.
The remaining proceeds and carry receivable were allocated to development assets.
The disposal of 10% of the Groups working interest in the development asset with related working capital adjustments resulted in a gain on disposal of US$26.6m and a tax credit of US$4.6m in the 2015 income statement.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 146 2.6 Intangible Assets Goodwill Accounting policy Cairn allocates the purchase consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the underlying CGU including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the income statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future years.
In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated from the date of acquisition to the group of CGUs representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored.
Cairns policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, within the segment is based on its fair value less costs of disposal, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the result of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

147 Financial Statements Section 2 Assets and Investments: Oil and Gas Assets and Decommissioning Provisions continued 2.7 Impairment Testing Sensitivity Analysis UK & Norway At 31 December 2016, impairment tests were conducted on the Groups exploration appraisal assets, development assets and goodwill.
This resulted in an impairment charge of US$11.0m on exploration appraisal assets: see section 2.1.
The recoverable amount for all assets is based on fair value less costs of disposal estimated using discounted cash flow modelling.
The key assumptions used in determining the fair value are often subjective, such as the future oil price assumption, or reliant upon the performance of operational partners for delivering development projects on time and within approved budgets.
With Cairns two North Sea development projects nearing first oil production, the Group have increased confidence over the likelihood of the production commencing in line with internal estimates.
Sensitivity analysis performed on delays to production did not indicate a material impact on the Groups impairment test calculations.
Cairn has run sensitivities on its long-term oil price assumption of US$70, using alternate long-term price assumptions of US$65 and US$60 and a long-term assumption equal to the forward curve price at the end of the Groups three year short term assumption.
The impact of these changes on the carrying value of the Groups assets at the balance sheet date is summarised below: Reduction in long-term oil price assumption to: Forward US$65 US$60 Curve US$m US$m US$m Impairment of intangible assets exploration appraisal assets 14.0 16.0 19.0 Impairment of property, plant & equipment development assets 16.9 58.0 114.7 Impairment of goodwill 30.5 93.3 124.3 Total impairment 61.4 167.3 258.0 The Groups proved and probable and contingent reserve estimates are based on P50 probabilities.
P10 and P90 estimates are also produced but would not provide a reasonable estimate to be used in calculating the fair value of the Groups assets.
Cairns reserve estimates do not materially differ from those of the operators.
Senegal The Groups exploration assets in Senegal, containing the two 2014 discoveries, has been tested for impairment as a single cash generating unit.
Further downside sensitivity performed on the Groups oil price assumption did not identify an impairment using any of the alternate price scenarios noted above.
International The Groups portfolio of international assets was reviewed for indicators of impairment and impairment of US$14.3m was recorded on the Groups appraisal asset in Ireland.
As the remaining assets in this segment are at an early stage in the exploration life-cycle, any impairment test would not be sensitive to changes in the oil price or any other key assumption: if an indicator of impairment was identified on a remaining asset that asset would be impaired in full.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 148 Section 3 Assets and Investments: Financial Assets and Working Capital Cairns liquid cash resources supported by the undrawn secured borrowing facility ensure the Group is fully funded to meet its current exploration and development programme despite the current restriction on the sale of shares in Cairn India Limited.
This section focuses on those assets, together with the working capital position of the Group at the year end.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Available-for-sale financial asset The Groups 9.8% shareholding in Cairn India Limited is classified as a non-current available-for-sale financial asset and the closing book value of the asset represents the quoted market price of the Groups residual holding.
Although Cairn is currently not able to sell its stake, there is no restriction in the wider market where Cairn India Limited shares trade freely at this price.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: There were no key estimations or assumptions in this section.
3.1 Available-for-Sale Financial Assets Accounting policy The Groups available-for-sale financial asset represents listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cumulative gains or losses that arise on subsequent disposal of the available-for-sale asset are recycled through the incomestatement.
At each reporting date, the fair value of the financial asset is compared to the value at the date of its initial recognition for signs of a prolonged or significant deficit in the valuation, which would indicate impairment.
Where impairment is identified, cumulative losses recognised in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement.
In the event of a subsequent recovery in the valuation of the asset, there is no reversal of impairment: any such post-impairment gains are recognised as a surplus through other comprehensive income.
Any further impairment losses will be recognised through the income statement.

These listed equity securities present the Group with an opportunity for return through dividend income or trading gains.
At 31 December 2016, the value of the investment in Cairn India Limited had increased to US$656.1m.
The significant accumulated deficit during 2015 of US$318.6m was recycled to the 2015 income statement and recorded as impairment.
Cairn is currently restricted from selling its shares in Cairn India Limited.
The Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from the listed equity investments it holds in Cairn India Limited.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 150 3.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents continued Cairn invests surplus funds into high-quality liquid investments, including money market funds, short-term bank deposits and tri-party repurchase transactions repos.
Cairn limits the placing of such funds and other investments to banks or financial institutions that have ratings of Aor above from at least two of Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch, unless a sovereign guarantee is available from an AAA rated government.
The counterparty limits vary between US$50.0m and US$200.0m depending on the ratings of the counterparty.
No investments are placed with any counterparty with a five-year credit default swap exceeding 250 bps.
Investments in money market liquidity funds are only made with AAA rated liquidity funds and the maximum holding in any single fund is 5% of total investments.
Where investments are made in repos, collateral is fixed income debt securities with a minimum rating of BBBwhich is managed by Euroclear.
No adjustment is made to the counterparty credit rating to reflect the collateral held when assessing investment options.
The Groups Treasury function manages the credit risk associated with such investments as detailed in note 3.6.
On 18 July 2014, Cairn Energy PLC signed a seven-year reserve-based lending facility with a syndicate of six international banks BNP Paribas, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, DNB Bank ASA, HSBC Bank PLC, Socit Gnrale and Standard Chartered Bank which was effective 1 August 2014.
Until completion of the Catcher and Kraken developments, the facility can be utilised to fund development costs on those projects and facility finance costs.
No amounts have been drawn under the facility, with maximum available currently forecast to be US$350.0mUS$400.0m during the course of the development projects.
The facility may also be utilised to issue letters of credit and performance guarantees for the Cairn Group of up to US$175.0m.
Following completion, the facility can be used for general corporate purposes.
Interest on outstanding debt will be charged at the appropriate LIBOR for the currency drawn plus an applicable margin.
The facility is subject to bi-annual redeterminations, has a market standard suite of covenants and is cross-guaranteed by all Group companies party to the facility.
Debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period from 1 July 2018 to the final maturity date of 30 June 2021.

In 2015, other receivables included costs incurred by Cairn on behalf of joint operations of US$6.9m which were reimbursed during 2016.
The Dyas carry was recorded at its initial fair value at the date of the transaction and is released to development assets based on the payments made by Dyas on Cairns behalf.
Joint operation receivables include Cairns working interest share of the receivables relating to joint operations and amounts recoverable from partners in joint operations.
The Groups other receivables predominantly relate to investing and financing activities.
Therefore, the movement in other receivables through operating cash flows, reported in the cash flow statement, is not significant.
At 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, no material amount within the Groups other receivables or joint operation receivables was past due or impaired.
In determining the recoverability of other receivables the Group carries out a risk analysis based on the type and age of the outstanding receivable.

The Board of Cairn Energy PLC, through the Treasury Sub-Committee, reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
The Group is also exposed to market risk arising from equity price fluctuations on available-for-sale financial assets see section 3.1 for details.
The Groups treasury function and Executive Team as appropriate are responsible for managing these risks, in accordance with the policies set by the Board.
Management of these risks is carried out by monitoring of cash flows, investment and funding requirements using a variety of techniques.
These potential exposures are managed whilst ensuring that the Company and the Group have adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet their immediate cash requirements.
There are no significant concentrations of risks unless otherwise stated.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 152 3.6 Financial Risk Management: Objectives and Policies continued The primary financial assets and liabilities comprise cash, short and medium-term deposits, notice accounts, tri-party purchase transactions repos, certificates of deposit, money market liquidity funds, listed equity shares Cairn India Limited only, intra-group loans and other receivables and financial liabilities held at amortised cost.
The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives such as equity issues and other forms of non-investment-grade debt finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate.
Liquidity risk The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk using both short and long-term cash flow projections, supplemented by debt and equity financing plans and active portfolio management.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in and delays of development projects.
The Groups forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have financial headroom for the 12 months from the date of approval of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
Details of the Groups debt facilities can be found in section 3.2.
The Group is subject to quarterly forecast liquidity tests as part of the debt facility agreement.
The Group has complied with the liquidity requirements of this test at all times during the year.
The Group runs various sensitivities on its liquidity position on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
Further details are noted in the viability statement provided on page 40.
The Group currently has surplus cash that is invested in a combination of money market liquidity funds, repos, notice accounts and term deposits with a number of international and UK financial institutions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short and medium-term expenditure requirements.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments with banks and financial institutions and joint operations.
Joint operation partners are subject to a risk assessment using publicly available information and credit reference agencies, with follow-up due diligence and monitoring if required.
Investment credit risk for investments with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Group Treasury function in accordance with the Board-approved policies of Cairn Energy PLC.
These policies limit counterparty exposure, maturity, collateral and take account of published ratings, market measures and other market information.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate the risk of financial loss through counterparty failure.
It is Cairns policy to invest with banks or other financial institutions that firstly offer the greatest degree of security in the view of the Group and, secondly the most competitive interest rates.
Repayment of principal is the overriding priority and this is achieved by diversification and shorter maturities to provide flexibility.
The Board continually re-assesses the Groups policy and updates as required.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk.
As at 31 December 2016 the Group had investments with 13 counterparties 2015: 24 to ensure no concentration of counterparty investment risk.
The reduction in the number of counterparties holding investments reflects the Groups reduced cash balance.
The maturity of these investments ranged from instant access to one month.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from non-functional currency receipts and payments by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
The Group also aims where possible to hold surplus cash, debt and working capital balances in the functional currency of the subsidiary, thereby matching the reporting currency and functional currency of most companies in the Group.
This minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups balance sheet.
Where residual net exposures do exist and they are considered significant the Company and Group may from time to time opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to movements in the US$:GBP and US$:NOK exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups monetary assets and liabilities.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

This section also includes details of employee benefits paid in the year and finance income andcosts.
4.1 Segmental Analysis Operating segments Cairns business model is to create, add and realise value from a balanced portfolio.
To ensure focus on Senegal, while actively managing the balanced portfolio, from 1 January 2016 Cairn implemented a new organisational structure based around three groups of Senegal, UK & Norway and International.
These three business units, based on geographical regions, form the Groups operating segments.
Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the new organisational structure.
Each business unit is headed by a regional director a regional director may be responsible for more than one business unit and the Board monitors the results of each separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
The Senegal business units focus is on appraising the successful 2014 discoveries offshore Senegal and to identify further exploration prospects for future drilling.
The UK & Norway business unit includes exploration activities in the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea and management of the Groups development assets in the UK North Sea.
The International business unit consists of all other regions where Cairn currently holds or held during the year exploration licences, including Greenland, Ireland, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania and the Mediterranean.
The Other Cairn Energy Group segment exists to accumulate the activities and results of the holding company and other unallocated expenditure and net assets liabilities including amounts of a corporate nature not specifically attributable to any of the business units.
Geographical information: non-current assets Non-current assets for this purpose consist of intangible exploration appraisal assets: property, plant & equipment development assets: intangible assets goodwill: and other property, plant & equipment and intangible assets.

The primary inputs to the model are consistent with those of the other share award schemes, though vesting percentages for LTIPs can be above 100%.
For details on the vesting conditions attached to the LTIPs refer to the Directors Remuneration Report on page 118.
The other Cairn Energy PLC share awards during 2016 were also valued using a Monte Carlo model.
Awards in prior years were valued similarly.
Cairn Energy PLC share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year, subject to the normal employee dealing bans imposed by the Company at certain times.
The weighted average share price during the year was 1.902 2015: 1.653.
The main inputs to the models include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are based on the length of time after the vesting periods for awards in 2016, further details are below.
The risk-free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE, as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 120 and 121, over a 10-year period to the date of award.

Analysis is provided of the Groups income statement charges and credits and deferred tax movements through the balance sheet.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Deferred taxation In prior years, Cairn recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of UK North Sea oil and gas assets.
This deductible temporary difference represented eligible field allowances on the Kraken and Catcher assets and tax losses available to offset future taxable profits from those assets offset by other taxable temporary differences.
At each reporting date, Cairn reviews the carrying value of deferred tax assets to assess whether it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise unused tax losses and allowances which give rise to the asset.
Given the sustained low oil price forecast, Cairn does not believe that it is probable that UK North Sea assets will generate the taxable profits necessary to allow the temporary differences reflected in the deferred tax asset to be utilised in full.
The Group therefore reversed its remaining deferred tax asset in the prior year.
Deferred tax assets are therefore only recognised to the extent that they offset deferred tax liabilities.
Contingent liability Indian tax Cairn has been resolutely defending the Groups tax position in India following the tax issue raised and subsequent demand notice issued by the Indian Income Tax department.
Cairn has filed a claim under the UK India bilateral investment treaty with the Indian Government and international arbitration proceedings have commenced.
Based on the strengths of Cairns legal arguments, no provision is made in the financial statements for any claim made by the Indian Income Tax Department.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Future taxable profits used in determining whether it is appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset are based on the key assumptions used in impairment testing, detailed in section 2.1.
Downside sensitivities are used to determine the extent to which future taxable profits are probable.
Accounting policy The total tax charge or credit represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax credit is based on the taxable loss for the year.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
In Norway, tax refunds may be claimed on qualifying exploration activities and related overhead costs: the tax refundable is included as a tax credit in the period in which the qualifying expenditure is incurred.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint operations where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset or liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
5.1 Tax Strategy and Governance The Groups tax strategy is fully aligned with its overarching business objectives and principles.
Cairn commits to managing its tax affairs in a transparent and responsible manner and ensuring that all statutory obligations and disclosure requirements are met.
Cairns aim is to comply with both the letter and spirit of the law in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate, to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid, at the right time, within the right jurisdiction.
As the Groups UK activities are focused on assets in development, with no saleable production at present, there are currently no taxable profits in the UK.
Taxable profits in other jurisdictions, where Cairns assets are in the early stages of the value creation cycle, are also minimal and as a result there were no cash payments of corporation taxes made during the year 2015: nil.
161 Financial Statements Section 5 Taxation continued 5.1 Tax Strategy and Governance continued Cairns policy is to not enter into any artificial tax avoidance schemes and to build and maintain strong collaborative working relationships with all relevant tax authorities, based on honesty, integrity and proactive cooperation.
The Group aims for certainty in relation to the tax treatment of all items: however, it is acknowledged that this will not always be possible, for example where transactions are complex or there is a lack of maturity in the tax regime in the relevant jurisdiction in which the Group are operating.
In such circumstances Cairn will seek external advice where appropriate and ensure that the approach adopted in any relevant tax return is supportable and includes full disclosure of the position taken.

Expenditure incurred on Cairns behalf by Dyas BV under the carry agreement see note 2.3, capitalised in Property, plant and equipment development assets, creates a deferred tax liability.
UK deferred tax credits of US$34.9m were realised to offset this deferred tax liability.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 162 5.2 Tax Credit Charge on Loss for the Year continued Factors affecting tax credit charge for the year A reconciliation of income tax charge applicable to loss before income tax at the UK statutory rate to income tax credit at the Groups effective income tax rate is as follows: 2016 2015 US$m US$m Loss before taxation 151.5 497.8 Loss before tax multiplied by the UK statutory rate of corporation tax of 20% 2015: 20.25% 30.3 100.8 Effect of: Special tax rates and reliefs applying to oil and gas activities 21.2 71.5 Impact of change in UK tax rate on opening deferred tax 89.5 Impact of increase in available investment allowance 19.5 Impact on deferred tax of adjustments in respect of prior year 5.0 1.7 Temporary differences not recognised 21.3 100.5 Release of provision on carried interests due to change in tax rate 5.5 3.4 Foreign exchange movements 0.1 1.7 Other 3.6 3.4 Total tax credit charge on loss 56.5 17.7 The reconciliation shown above has been based on the average UK statutory rate of corporation tax for 2016 of 20% 2015: 20.25%.
The UK main rate of corporation tax is currently 20% 21% prior to 1 April 2015.
The applicable UK statutory tax rate applying to North Sea oil and gas activities is 40%.
The applicable rate applying to the prior year was 50%.
The reduction in rate, enacted in September 2016, was effective from 1 January 2016.
The applicable Norwegian rate applying to oil and gas activities is 78%.
The change in the UK tax rate had no impact either on the Groups UK net deferred tax position at 31 December 2016 or on the tax credit for theyear.
The increase in available investment allowance is a result of the increase in Cairns working interest in the Kraken development from 25% to 29.5%.
5.3 Income Tax Asset The income tax asset of US$26.1m 2015: US$33.0m relates to cash tax refunds due from the Norwegian authorities on the tax value of exploration and other qualifying expenses incurred in Norway during the year.
This refund will be received in 2017.

Recognised deferred tax assets As at the balance sheet date, no net deferred tax asset or liability has been recognised in the UK 2015: no net deferred tax asset or liability recognised as other temporary differences and tax losses are only recognised to the extent that they offset the UK deferred tax liability arising on business combinations and carried interests attributable to UK Ring-Fence trading activity, as it is not considered probable that future profits will be available to recover the value of the asset given the detrimental change in market conditions continuing to impact the oil and gas industry.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of Norwegian tax losses of US$11.6m 2015: US$10.5m against a Norwegian deferred tax liability arising from business combinations and expenditure on assets for which current tax refunds have been claimed.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 164 5.4 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets No deferred tax asset has been recognised on the following as it is not considered probable that it will be utilised in future periods: 2016 2015 US$m US$m UK fixed asset temporary differences 349.3 294.2 UK Ring Fence trading losses 169.3 260.1 UK non-Ring-Fence trading losses 3.4 3.7 UK non-Ring-Fence pre-trade losses 6.4 5.5 UK excess management expenses 305.1 288.6 UK non-trade deficits 68.8 64.3 UK temporary differences on share-based payments 37.7 21.0 UK other temporary differences 0.1 0.3 Greenlandic tax losses 1,003.9 1,031.3 Temporary differences in respect of available-for-sale financial asset 2.7 274.8 At the balance sheet date, the Group has US$683.3m 2015: US$567.9m UK Ring Fence trading losses available to offset against future UK Ring Fence trading profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of US$514.0m 2015: US$307.8m of these losses, offsetting in full a deferred tax liability on Ring Fence fixed asset temporary differences.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on the remaining UK Ring Fence losses of US$169.3m 2015: US$260.1m as it is not considered probable that this amount will be utilised in future periods.
The deferred tax liability recognised on UK Ring Fence fixed asset temporary differences of US$205.6m 2015: US$153.9m includes temporary differences in respect of investment allowances previously field allowances of US$693.5m 2015: US$722.2m on the Catcher and Kraken developments which will reduce future Ring Fence profits subject to supplementary charge.
5.5 Contingent Liability Indian Tax Assessment Cairn UK Holdings Limited CUHL, a direct subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC, is in receipt of an assessment order from the Indian Income Tax Department IITD relating to the intra-group restructuring undertaken in 2006 prior to the IPO of CIL in India, which cites a retrospective amendment to Indian tax law introduced in 2012.
Cairn strongly contests the basis of this attempt to retrospectively tax the group for an .
The assessment order is in the amount of INR102bn approximately US$1.5bn plus interest backdated to 2007 totalling INR 188bn approximately US$2.8bn.
The total assets of CUHL have a value at the balance sheet date of US$749.3m comprising principally the groups 9.8% shareholding in CIL and any recovery by the Indian authorities would be limited to such assets.
CUHL is pursuing its rights under Indian law to appeal the assessment, both in respect of the basis of taxation and the quantum assessed.
CUHLs 9.8% shareholding in CIL was originally attached by the IITD in January 2014 and CUHL continues to be restricted by the IITD from selling such shares.
Furthermore, Cairn has also commenced international arbitration proceedings against the Republic of India under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty the Treaty, on the basis that Indias actions have breached the Treaty by 1 expropriating Cairns property without adequate and just compensation, 2 denying fair and equitable treatment to Cairn in respect of its investments and 3 restricting Cairns right to freely transfer funds in connection with its investment.
Based on detailed legal advice, Cairn is confident that it will be successful in such arbitration.
The seat of arbitration has been agreed as The Hague in the Netherlands and Cairn has filed its Statement of Claim which clearly demonstrates that applying the retrospective amendment to Cairn and seizing US$1bn worth of CIL shares was in breach of the UK-India Investment Treaty obligations of fair and equitable treatment and its protections against expropriation.
The Republic of Indias Statement of Defence was filed in early February 2017 with evidential hearings now expected to take place in January 2018.
Cairn has asked the arbitration panel either to order India to withdraw its unlawful tax demand and compensate Cairn for the harm suffered by the seizure of the CIL shares, being not less than US$1.1bn plus costs : or, if the tax demand remains in place, compensate Cairn for the quantum of the tax assessment and the harm suffered by the seizure of the CIL shares, being together not less than US$5.6bn plus costs.

Foreign currency translation Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves.
Foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Merger and capital reserves The merger reserve of US$255.9m arose in 2012 on shares issued by Cairn on the acquisition of Capricorn Norge AS.
Capital reserves nondistributable of US$40.8m, of which US$0.7m relates to Cairn Energy PLC the Company, include non-distributable amounts arising on various Group acquisitions and the capital redemption reserve arising from the 2013 2014 share buy-back programme.
Available-for-sale reserve The available-for-sale reserve represents fair value movements on the available-for-sale financial asset see section 3.1 which arose during 2016.
As at 31 December 2015 the deficit for the year had been recycled to the income statement as impairment.

The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The Group is subject to quarterly forecast liquidity tests as part of the reserve-based lending facility.
The Group has complied with the capital requirements of this test at all times during the year.
Cairn manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, Cairn may buy back shares, make a special dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities see section 3.2 or undertake other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2016.
