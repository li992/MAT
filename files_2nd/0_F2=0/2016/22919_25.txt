The remaining components of net cash flow from investing activities that do not form part of free cash flow, as defined by the groups management, are in respect of the acquisition and sale of businesses.

Where appropriate, separate explanations are given for the impacts of acquisitions and sale of businesses, dividends paid and the purchase of own shares, each of which arises from decisions that are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
