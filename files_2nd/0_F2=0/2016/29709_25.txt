60 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group and Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with theprovisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for the Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in November 2014 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis compliant with the SORP.
In the prior period, the SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts were prepared for the Company only, as the subsidiary companies in the Group were not considered material.
However following the formation of the new subsidiary SVGC Managers Limited SVGCM during the year, which acts as the investment manager of the Company, the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 January 2016 have been prepared on a consolidated basis for the SVG Capital plc Group.
As a result of this change, the current period Group amounts are not entirely comparable with the Company-only prior period amounts.
In the prior period, the Company changed its year end from 31 December to 31 January.
This was driven by the Companys move away from a single manager focus to one that is more diversied and the resultant expectation that Fund investment valuations will be received across a broader timeframe, which the change in year end is anticipated to accommodate.
As a result of this reporting date change, performance for the prior period is measured over a 13 month period, compared to the 12 month period for the current year results, andtherefore amounts provided in these financial statements are not entirely comparable.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors consider that for the foreseeable future at least 12 months from the end of reporting date the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Summary of new standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements that the Directors deem to be relevant to SVG Capital plc: Effective date IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Not before 1 January 2019 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements inthe period of initial application, however, it is recognised that additional disclosures within the financial statements will be required.
Presentation of income statement In order to better reect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Groups contractual right to the cash ow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Groups business is investing in financial assets with a view to proting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction which would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 61 1 Accounting policies continued Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEV Valuation Guidelines.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
Investments in subsidiaries In line with IFRS 10, the Group consolidates subsidiaries that are not a investment entity and whose main purpose and activities are providing services that relate to the investment entitys investment activities.
Therefore, SVGCM has been consolidated.
In line with IAS28, the investment in SVGCM is carried at cost in the Companys accounts.
All other subsidiaries are measured at fair value in both theGroups and Companys accounts.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group or Company is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The Group and Company measure their investments in associates at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss intheperiod in which they occur.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The liability component is accounted for as a borrowing.
The acceleration ofpremium on the equity components on any early redemptions of the loan notes are recognised in the income statement.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans issued are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares Own shares represent SVG Capital plc shares held in Employee benefit Trusts EBT to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans.
The EBTs are accounted for as extensions of the parent company.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments issued to employees of the investment manager are measured at fair value at the date ofgrant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period hasexpired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts received or receivable for services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
62 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established and is classied within operating activities in the cash ow statement.
Revenue that has been earned, but the receipt of which is contingent on the occurrence of a future event, such as investors receiving areturn of capital, is only recognised when management judges the realisation of that income to be virtually certain.
The Groups revenue and realised capital gains are derived primarily from distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
Realised gains on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds, and on sale of investments are credited to the income statement and taken to the capital reserve.
Income distributions are credited to the income statement and taken to the revenue reserve.
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Group and Company is pounds sterling, as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group and Company operate.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of thetransactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated atthe rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement and are allocated either to revenue or capital, as appropriate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted bythe balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 1158 Income and Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capitalgains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities inthe financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using thebalance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from theinitial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, andinterests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable thatthe temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
Assets are classied as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Group has classied short-term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 63 2 significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group and Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of profits and net assets at the end of the reporting period.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that have a material impact on net assets in future periods.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to net assets within the next financial year are discussed below.
Other areas of uncertainty and risk are discussed in note 27.
Assessment as an investment entity Entities that meet the denition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to measure their subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss rather than consolidate them, except for subsidiaries that are not an investment entity and that provide services that relate to the investment entitys investment activities.
The criteria which define an investment entity are, as follows: k an entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services: k an entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and k an entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
SVG Capital plc is an international private equity investor listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group and Company annual and interim accounts clearly state its objective of achieving capital appreciation and investment income by investing in a portfolio of private equity and private equity related assets.
The Company reports to its investors via quarterly investor information, and to its management, via internal management reports, on a fair value basis.
Substantially all investments are reported at fair value to the extent allowed by IFRS in the Funds annual and interim reports.
The Board has also concluded that the Company meets the additional characteristics of an investment entity, in that it has more than one investment: the investments are predominantly in the form of private equity and similar securities: it has more than one investor: and its investors are not related parties.
The Board has concluded that the Company meets the denition of an investment entity.
These conclusions will be reassessed on an annual basis, if any of these criteria or characteristics change.
Whilst the Company has been deemed an investment entity as detailed above, the new wholly-owned subsidiary SVGCM acts as the investment manager of the Company and is not an investment entity itself, thus in line with IFRS 10 it has been consolidated into the Group financial statements.
All remaining subsidiaries in the Group have been measured at fair value through protand loss.
Fair value of financial instruments The Group primarily invests in private equity limited partnerships Funds that in turn invest in companies that are typically unquoted.
Valuing unquoted investments involves a significant degree of judgement.
Fair values of the invested Funds is generally considered to be the Groups share of the net asset value of the Fund, as determined by the general partner GP of such funds, adjusted as considered necessary by the Board, and approved by the Board.
Further details of the valuation techniques and related analyses of sensitivities are given in note 13.
The Group values its investment portfolio in accordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines which is considered to be industry standard.
However, amounts ultimately realised on disposal of an investee company can differ materially from the previous carrying value and therefore have a significant impact on the Groups profits and net assets.
Assessment of fund investments as structured entities The Group has assessed whether the Funds in which it invests should be classied as structured entities.
The Group has considered the voting rights and other similar rights afforded to investors in these Funds, including the rights to remove the fund manager or liquidate the fund.
The Group has concluded on whether these rights are the dominant factor in controlling the Funds, or whether the contractual agreement with the fund manager is the dominant factor in controlling the Funds.
The Group has concluded that some of its fund investments are unconsolidated structured entities: further details can be found innote12.

As the Group and Company invest primarily through partnership structures, excess management expenses relating to the private equity funds portfolio incurred by those partnerships are available to set off against any taxable income of the Group and Company.
These excess management expenses are not capitalised but unutilised expenses are carried forward to future periods.
b Deferred income taxes: A deferred tax asset of 35.8 million 2015: 30.4 million, of which nil 2015: nil would have been recognised in equity, relating to excess management expenses, losses and other temporary differences, has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which these losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
The excess management expenses and other temporary differences to which this unrecognised asset relates are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits.

The net gain on investments shown above of 83,757,000 2015: 117,594,000 includes realised gains on distributions of 146,433,000, split 133,609,000 for the core portfolio and 12,824,000 for the non-core portfolio 2015: realised gains of 34,027,000 split 25,648,000 for the core portfolio and 8,379,000 for the non-core portfolio.
All funds in the core portfolio are unlisted.
However, some of the underlying companies held within those funds are listed.
Included in the total core portfolio value are gross valuations of listed investments amounting to 134.1 million 2015: 320.5 million.
The Group and Company investment portfolios include Permira IV at a value of 168.8 million 2015: 447.8 million, which is net of a 25% provision against future distributions on the realisation of investments held by Permira IV, in accordance with the terms of the Permira IV reorganisation in December 2008.
It should also be noted that the value of the Permira IV investments attributed to follow-ons that were made after 2008 are not subject to a provision, as distributions in respect of such investments will be received in full.
During 2012, the Group sold its direct holding in Permira Europe III PE III, however it retained 50% of its exposure through PE III to one of the underlying investments, iglo Group, which has subsequently been acquired by Nomad Foods Nomad.
A contract is in place giving the Group the rights to 50% of all future distributions received by the acquirer in relation to its holding in Nomad.
The contract has been valued at 2.3 million 2015: 20.1 million.
The Board considers that the best indication of the fair value of the right to future distributions from Nomad is the current valuation of the Groups holding in Nomad as calculated in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
significant interests in investment funds Details of investments in which the Group or Company has an interest of 10% or more of any class of share units are detailed in the list ofinvestments on page 21.
The Group has a 35.6% 2015: 35.5% interest in Aberdeen Diamond Holdings Limited, a 35.8% 2015: 35.8% interest in Aberdeen Diamond Holdings II Limited and a 25.5% 2015: 25.5% interest in Aberdeen Diamond Private Equity Holdings III plc.
The Groups holdings in these entities do not represent controlling interests as the Group does not have power over relevant activities of those entities under IFRS 10.
Unconsolidated structured entities The Group invests in several investment funds which meet the denition of unconsolidated structured entities in accordance with IFRS12.
The investment funds are closed ended private equity limited partnerships or investment companies which invest in underlying companies for the purposes of capital appreciation.
These entities are generally nanced through committed capital from limited partners or shareholders, with cash being drawn down for nancing investment activity.
Based on the latest available information relatingto these funds, the total size of the unconsolidated structured entities is 5,785.9million 2015: 7,224.2 million.
As at 31 January 2016, the Groups maximum exposure to loss attributable to these entities comprises the current carrying value ofthe assets, along with the uncalled committed capital relating to those investments, as summarised below: Carrying Value at 31 January 2016 Uncalled Maximum loss Assets Liabilities commitments exposure Balance sheet line item of asset 000 000 000 000 Investments designated as fair value through profit and loss 280,491 219,141 499,632 Carrying Value at 31 January 2015 Uncalled Maximum loss Assets Liabilities commitments exposure Balance sheet line item of asset 000 000 000 000 Investments designated as fair value through profit and loss 532,797 128,451 661,248 70 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts continued 13 Fair values Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that would take place between market participants at the reporting date.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 13 requires disclosures relating to fair value measurement using a three-level fair value hierarchy.
The level within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Assessing the signicance of a particular input requires judgement, considering factors specic to the asset or liability.
Thefollowing table shows financial instruments recognised at fair value, analysed between those whose fair value is based on: k quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 : k those involving inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices Level 2 : and k those with inputs for the instrument that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 3.

Valuation techniques and process Investment valuations are updated on a quarterly basis following the completion of a detailed valuation process by each GP of the Fund investments.
The Valuation Team of the Investment Manager performs a review of the valuations to identify and understand any significant changes to valuation inputs or techniques.
The valuations are then discussed with the Investment Team of the Investment Manager, to ensure valuation movements are in line with expectations based on the performance of the investment.
The Investment Teams expectations are established based on the results of its continuous investment monitoring process.
The Valuation and Investment Teams hold quarterly calls with the GPs of the Fund investments to discuss updates on the Fund investments performance, position and outlook and, where considered appropriate, hold further meetings to understand and challenge valuation inputs.
On a quarterly basis, after the checks above have been performed, the Valuation Team presents the valuation results to the Board.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with fair value changes.
The valuations are reviewed and, if considered appropriate, approved by the Board.
Valuations consist of listed equities and unlisted managed funds.
Listed equities Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
When fair values of publicly traded equities are based on quoted market prices in an active market without any adjustments, the investments are included within Level 1 of the hierarchy.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 71 13 Fair values continued Unlisted managed funds The Group primarily invests in private equity via limited partnerships or other fund structures.
Such vehicles are typically unquoted and in turn invest primarily in unquoted securities.
The Groups investment portfolio is recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, inaccordance with IPEV Valuation Guidelines and IFRS.
Fair value is based on the Groups share of the net asset value of the Fund, as determined by the GP of such funds.
Updated net asset values are received for each fund on a quarterly basis.
The net asset value of a fund is calculated after determining the fair value of a funds investment in any investee companies.
This value is generally obtained by calculating the Enterprise Value EV of the investee company and then deducting financial instruments, such as external debt, ranking ahead of the Funds highest ranking instrument in the entity.
The Groups participation in the remaining instruments is then calculated to assess the fair value of the Groups investment.
These valuations are then adjusted for material cash ows that have taken place between the date of the valuation as determined by the GP and the reporting date.
A common method of determining the EV is to apply a market-based multiple e. g. an average multiple based on a selection of comparable quoted companies to the maintainable earnings of the investee company.
This market-based approach presumes that the comparator companies are correctly valued by the market.
A discount is sometimes applied to market-based multiples to adjust for points of difference between the comparators and the company being valued.
If the Valuation Team considers that an adjustment to the net asset value is appropriate to better reect fair value for market participants, the valuation is referred to the Pricing Committee of the Investment Manager.
The Pricing Committee reviews, and if considered appropriate, approves the Valuation Teams pricing adjustment recommendation.
Adjustments to net asset value may be considered, for example, where: k there has been significant elapsed time between the net asset value calculation date and the Groups balance sheet date: k there has been material movements in quoted prices between the net asset value calculation date and the Groups balance sheetdate: k the Group has agreed a sale of its holding in a fund interest at a price other than the net asset value: k valuations do not include a provision for carried interest: k net asset value is not derived from the fair value of underlying portfolio companies.
Investment in associates at fair value through profit or loss The fair value of the Groups investment in Aberdeen SVG as at 31 January 2015 was derived from a Discounted Cash Flow DCF calculation based on the expected future cash ows receivable from the associate, discounted at an appropriate rate.
The Groups share of equity in Aberdeen SVG was subject to a put and call option which was exercised during the period ended 31 January 2016, resulting in the Group selling its remaining holding 49.9% of the equity in the business.
significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 valuations Unlisted managed funds fair value 752,114,000 As described above, in arriving at the fair value of the unlisted managed funds, the key inputs are the net asset values as determined bythe GP of the funds and any approved pricing adjustments recommended by the Valuation Team.
In both the current and prior periods, the approved pricing adjustments to the GP valuations relate to carried interest provisions.
The range of net asset values for the 10 largest funds, which have an aggregate valuation of 82.9% of the unlisted managed funds portfolio, can be seen in note 28.
It is recognised that the valuations of these funds are sensitive to movements in the values of the underlying investee companies.
The 15largest underlying investee companies of the core portfolio in total amount to 364.1 million and include both quoted and unquoted companies.
At 31 January 2016, 32.7% of aggregate value of the 15 largest underlying investee companies in the core portfolio was derived from quoted prices and 67.3% represented unquoted valuations.
Quoted companies are valued based on market prices.
IFRS and IPEV Valuation Guidelines stipulate that quoted price should be used to value these companies at the valuation date.
Therefore, provided the net asset value calculation date and the Groups valuation date are aligned, the Board does not permit an adjustment to those valuations, unless there are significant restrictions applied to sale.
Quoted companies within the managed funds portfolio have been valued using quoted prices and foreign exchange rates as at 31 January 2016.
For unquoted investments, however, significant judgement is applied when calculating fair value.
The Board may consider adjustments to unquoted valuations as described above.
The range of possible adjustments could be broad and would vary based on the circumstances driving the adjustment.
In the past, the Board has adjusted the valuation of unquoted companies by between 0% and 100% of the GPs proposed valuation.
For the purposes of sensitivity analysis, a 10% adjustment could be considered reasonable.
A 10% adjustment to the valuation of the unquoted constituents of the 15largest underlying companies would result in a 2.3% movement in Shareholders funds.
72 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts continued 13 Fair values continued Investments in associates at fair value through profit or loss fair value nil As described above, the key inputs to the valuation of the investment in associate at the prior period-end was the quantum of the future cash ows and the discount factor applied.
The Board prepared the cash ows, which were based on dividends and the final payment under the option, using its best estimate at the reporting date and discounted these cash ows at 15%.
The resultant valuation for the investment in Aberdeen SVG as at 31 January 2015 was 41.0 million.
On 30 June 2015, the investment in associate was disposed of in full.
The Groups 49.9% holding in Aberdeen SVG was sold to Aberdeen Asset Management plc for 31.3 million, plus dividends of 12.0 million relating to accumulated profits of the associate, less related transaction costs.
Level 3 reconciliation The following table shows a reconciliation of all movements in the fair value of the investment portfolio including investments in associates categorised within Level 3 between the beginning and the end of the reporting period: For the For the 13month yearended period ended 31January 31January 2016 2015 Group and Company 000 000 Valuation of investment portfolio brought forward 1,084,058 1,083,718 Calls and purchases 93,640 177, 277 Distributions and sales 466,708 307,297 Fair value gains and losses on investment portfolio 82,124 116,805 Fair value losses gains on investment in associates 11,973 13,555 Proceeds received on disposal of investment in associates 29,027 Valuation carried forward 752,114 1,084,058 As detailed in note 16, the associated investment in Aberdeen SVG was disposed of during the year.
Dividends of 12.0 million were received from Aberdeen SVG, which reduced the carrying value to 29.0 million.
Proceeds of 31.3 million were received from the purchaser which realised a gain in the Group and Company income statements, after costs, of 1.1 million 2015: 0.3 million gain relating to assets held at the end of the period.
The remaining gains and losses in the income statements are in respect of assets held at 31 January 2016.
Fair value of financial instruments not held at fair value The Groups debt instruments, such as the loan facility and convertible loan notes, are not held at fair value.
Indicative fair values of these instruments are shown below along with their carrying value in the balance sheet see note 19.
The fair value of the convertible loan notes is based on the offer price of the notes on 31 January 2016 and 31 January 2015.
Whilst this offer price is obtainable from the market, the instrument is not frequently traded and would therefore fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The remaining subsidiaries in the Group detailed on the next page have been measured at fair value as at 31 January 2016.
A review has been undertaken and where appropriate the subsidiaries have been written down to their net asset value, which is considered to be the fair value.
As at 31 January 2016, SVG North America Inc. and SVG Advisers Inc. are in the closing stages of liquidation and will be making an imminent final capital distribution to the Company.

As a result of the Rights Issue and Placing in 2009, the Conversion Price was amended to 6.48 on 10 February 2009, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the convertible loan notes.
Following the Tender Offer completed in 2012 the Conversion Price was amended to 6.44.
The Tender Offer completed in 2013 was at a premium of less than 5% to the share price and therefore noamendment to the Conversion Price was required.
Following the Tender Offers completed in May 2014 and December 2014, the conversion price was amended to 6.42 and 6.40 respectively.
There was no amendment to the Conversion Price following theTenderOffers completed in the year ended 31 January 2016 see note 21.
The convertible loan notes are convertible at the option of the convertible loan note holder.

Capital management The Group allocates capital with the over-riding objective of maximising long-term value for shareholders.
New investment opportunities must pass two hurdles.
The first is a level of return that enables SVG Capital plc to achieve its long-term objective of 5.0% net outperformance of public markets.
The second is to be sufciently attractive given the associated risk, relative to alternative uses of capital including deleveraging or returning capital to shareholders.
The Groups revolving credit facility limits the amount that may be returned annually to shareholders by way of share buy-backs or tenders to 20% of gross assets.
The Groups total capital as at 31 January 2016 was 1,051,768,000 2015: 1,127,105,000 comprising equity shares, capital and reserves.

The fair value of equity-settled share options granted under both plans is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

The expected volatility reects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

The Group and Company diluted net asset value per share assumes that share options, performance shares and deferred shares note 21 with a strike price lower than the undiluted net asset value per share are exercised at the balance sheet date.
This would result in the issue of 781,383 ordinary shares 31 January 2015: 1,892,907 for consideration of nil 31 January 2015: 1,353,000.
The convertible loan notes 2016 are exercisable at a strike price of 640p, less than the undiluted net asset value per share, and were therefore dilutive at 31 January 2016.
Assuming the conversion is exercised at the balance sheet date, this would result in the issue of 6,109,375 ordinary shares and an increase in Group and Company net assets of 38,732,000 which the carrying value of the convertible loan notes as at 31 January 2016.
The convertible loan notes were not dilutive as at 31 January 2015.

Related party transactions during the year were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms-length transactions.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 83 27 Risk Financial instruments and risk prole The Groups primary investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of private equity and private equityrelated assets.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Group holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Group are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated nancing undertaken pursuant to this objective involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available fordividend.
Floating rate financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term deposits and AAA-rated money market funds.
Fixed rate financial assets include interest-bearing investments.
All financial assets are included at fair value.
b Financial liabilities As at 31 January 2016, the Group had a 300.0 million loan facility with Lloyds Bank plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and StateStreetBank and Trust Company, of which nil was drawn 31 January 2015: nil.
The Group had 38.7 million 2015: 97.3 million of subordinated convertible loan notes in issue at the balance sheet date.
The level of borrowing will impact on the Groups performance by amplifying the effect of movements in the valuation of the investment portfolio.
In addition to financial liabilities note 19, the Group also has uncalled fund commitments note 20 as at 31 January 2016 of331.9 million 2015: 367.1 million, which are discussed below as part of borrowing and funding risks.
It should also be noted that fund investments and underlying investee companies may also utilise borrowings to varying degrees.
This isparticularly the case with respect to CLO funds and structured private equity funds of funds, which are highly leveraged vehicles.

A more detailed analysis of the maturity prole of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities is shown below.
Financial assets maturity Analysis of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss into maturity groupings is based on the long-term nature of these assets and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that no distributions or realisations will occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date, although it is clearly possible that realisations will occur within that period.
Beyond that it is extremely difficult to judge the precise size or timing of such cash ows.
It is, however, a requirement under IFRS 7 to disclose such an analysis and therefore abreakdown is provided in the following table for illustrative purposes only.
It is emphasised that the analysis is provided purely to comply with accounting standards.
It is not a forecast and should not be construed as such.
It is based on broad assumptions, further details of which are provided below the table.
For other assets, the analysis into maturity groupings is based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date or if earlier, the expected date the assets will be realised.
Financial liabilities maturity The maturity groupings are based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity date.
When a counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group canbe required to pay.
For loan facility drawdowns this will be within three months, the maximum interest period of any loan utilisation.
At the loan maturity date, the loan amounts are available for effective re-drawing at the agreed terms subject to compliance with loan covenants.
For the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that outstanding loan amounts, if any, will remain drawn until the quarter-end prior to the expiry date of the facility, i. e. 30 September 2019.

Available liquidity gap 130,264 125,364 1,461 368,809 486,776 1,112,674 The assumed available liquidity in the above analysis is broadly expected to fund the uncalled commitments of the Groups investments, which at 31 January 2016 was 331.9 million 2015: 367.1 million.
These commitments are expected to be drawn over anumber of years.
The Groups actual liquidity prole is likely to be very different to the analysis outlined above.
In particular, it is very difficult to predict the quantum and timing of returns on the Groups long-term investment portfolio.
As already mentioned, it is important to note that the maturity analysis in respect of financial assets at fair value i. e. the investment portfolio is highly subjective and is not a forecast of the expected cash ows.
For the purposes of the maturity analysis it has been assumed that all financial assets will be realised at their year end carrying value.
The amounts receivable within three months are based on actual cash ows.
The residual balance has been allocated based on the current contractual maturities of the fund vehicle.
However, in order to facilitate the orderly winding up of the investments, the terms of the funds may be extended beyond the contractual maturity date.
Similarly, underlying investments may be realised prior to the contractual maturity date of the funds as investments are sold at timings deemed appropriate by the fund manager.
The Groups undrawn loan facility amounted to 228.2 million at 31 January 2016 and is subject to financial covenants as discussed in note 19.
Uncalled fund commitments At 31 January 2016, the Group had uncalled fund commitments of 331.9 million 2015: 367.1 million, which are expected to be drawn over a number of years.
It should be noted that when these commitments are funded they will typically be used to make investments and therefore create an asset that would be expected to be realised for cash over the longer term.
The Groups uncalled commitments are covered by the year end cash balance of 330.4 million 2015: 134.9 million, the 300 million loan facility of 228.2 million 224.9 million maturing in December 2019, and distributions from the current portfolio investments.
86 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Risk continued Risks The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are considered to be funding risk and valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing these and other risks as summarised below.
Funding risks The nature of investing in private equity funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note20.
At 31 January 2016, the Group had uncalled commitments of 331.9 million 2015: 367.1 million, compared to cash balances of330.4million 2015: 134.9 million and Shareholders funds of 1,051.8 million 2015: 1,127.1 million.
The Company is a closed-ended investment trust and is therefore not subject to redemption requests from its investors.
The Companys shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, the Groups commitments to private equity funds and other financial liabilities will be nanced by available cash resources and distributions received on the realisation of underlying investments within the fund portfolio.
To mitigate the risk that the timing of distributions being received does not match the timing of capital called for new investments, the Group has a 300.0 million loan facility, which was undrawn at 31 January 2016, that could be drawn on, subject to financial covenants as described in note 19, to meet fund commitments as they fall due.
The Group has never defaulted on any of its borrowing obligations.
The Board regularly monitors liquidity risk and, if considered appropriate, could renegotiate its lending arrangements or issue new securities.
The Groups investments are mainly illiquid but, in extremis, the Board could consider selective disposals of long-term investments, if required to meet commitments as they fall due.
In these circumstances it is possible that, dependent on prevailing market conditions, the realisation value of such assets could beat asignicant discount to their previous carrying value.
The Group is in a strong financial position but a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor to the relevant fund, itwill suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
The Group or Company has never defaulted on any fund commitment.
The Groups 300.0 million loan facility expires in December 2019.
The convertible loan notes are repayable on 5 June 2016.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly and rigorously reviewing cash ow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Board.
Valuation market price risk The Groups exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of the Companys underlying investments.
A detailed analysis of the investment portfolio and of the 15 largest underlying companies in the core portfolio is given in the investment portfolio review.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies, all underlying investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the current IPEV Valuation Guidelines and IFRS 13.
The IPEV Valuation Guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
It should be noted that a large proportion of the Companys underlying investee companies may be unquoted and therefore the valuation of such companies involves exercising judgement.
The Group does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which would ordinarily be unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
As an indication of the valuation risk facing the Group, it benefited from fair value gains on its investment portfolio of 83.8 million during the period 2015: gains of 117.6 million.
See note 12 for further details.
The Groups sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in the Groups levels of borrowing and liquidity, asapproved by the Board.
It will also be affected by leverage in the underlying companies in which we invest and the local currency denomination of such investments, which is considered separately under currency risk.
At 31 January 2016, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups aggregate investments designated as fair value through profit and loss would result in a 7.3% 2015: 9.3% change in Shareholders funds.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 87 27 Risk continued Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Group may wish to transfer its holdings in particular funds.
In the majority of the funds in which the Group will invest, the GP, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by the board of a private company, torefuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Group has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer ofan interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the GPs, trustees or managers overriding duciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Group.
Concentration risk At 31 January 2016, the value of the 15 largest core underlying investee holdings represented 66.9% of the gross core portfolio 2015: 85.1%.
In March 2012, the Company received shareholder approval to change its investment objective and is building a portfolio of a select number of top performing private equity managers, co-investments and smaller control investments.
The Company has subsequently made commitments to six managers, and four co-investments.
In the year, there have been significant realisations from the Companys legacy holdings in Permira IV, which has reduced concentration risk.
That said, the Companys two largest investments NXP Semiconductors Freescale : 111.4 million: and Platform Specialty Products Arysta LifeScience : 78.5 million are Permira IV investments, so the process of rebalancing the portfolio is still incomplete and therefore a degree of concentration risk remains.
Interest rate risk The Groups revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since a portion of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest see note 4.
It also pays interest on its convertible loan notes and drawings on the loan facility although nil drawn at 31 January 2016 as detailed in note 8.
The Groups primary objective is to achieve capital returns from its investments and, as such, the main exposure to interest rate risk is indirect, through its impact on the valuation of the private equity funds, although it is not possible to quantify such effects.
Interest rates are one of the key determinants of economic growth.
At a more specic level, interest rates and credit spreads also have an important role in the ability of private equity funds to secure profitable deals, as many transactions are partly nanced by debt.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately.
At 31 January 2016, the Group held investments in AAA-rated money market funds valued at 311.6 million 2015: 119.8 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds are redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Based on the money market funds held at 31 January 2016 and the interest rates as at that date, a 0.25% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would generate additional annual interest income of 779,000 and similarly a decrease in interest rates of 0.25% would lead toa reduction in annual interest income of 779,000.
Other oating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
Based on the bank balances held at 31 January 2016 and interest rates as at that date, a 0.25% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would lead to an annual increase of 47,000 of interest income.
A decrease in interest rates of 0.25% would have no impact on annual interest income as the current interest earnings are negligible, although they could become negative.
At 31 January 2016, the Group had 38.7 million 2015: 97.3 million of convertible loan notes see note 19.
Interest rate risk on the Bonds is mitigated as they pay xed coupon.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group unless otherwise disclosed.
The Group is subject to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to cash and cash equivalents is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties.
Cash equivalents at the year end comprised money market funds with a variety of counterparties, each fund having a credit rating of AAA.
88 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Risk continued Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency andtheirsterling value can be signicantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
The Group has a 300.0 million loan facility which, if drawn, would also act as a hedge against the currency risk on the valueofits euro-denominated assets.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the effect of exchange rate uctuations on the value of Shareholders funds, the results ofwhich are set out in the table below.
Hypothetical Hypothetical Equity value value Shareholders 10% 10% funds depreciation appreciation Group million million million 31 January 2016 Equity Shareholders funds 1,051.8 1,131.6 986.4 Change in Shareholders funds effect on income 7.6% 6.2% 31 January 2015 Equity Shareholders funds 1,127.1 1,241.9 1,038.0 Change in Shareholders funds effect on income 10.2% 7.9% Capital risk management The objective of the Group is to provide shareholders with long-term growth in capital.
In pursuing this long-term objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
It must therefore maintain an appropriate capital structure through varying market conditions.
This involves the ability to: issue and buyback share capital within limits set by the shareholders in general: and borrow monies in the short and long term.
Changes to ordinary share capital are set out in note 21.
Borrowings are set out in note 19.
General risks associated with investment in private equity Investment in private equity involves a high degree of risk.
The Group invests in private equity through its exposure to private equity funds and co-investments.
Such investments are illiquid and as such may be difficult to realise, particularly within a short timeframe.
The Directors seek to maintain a diversied portfolio of investments to mitigate these risks, although the portfolio does remain fairly concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers and also to vintage as explained in concentration risk on page 87.
Default risk A funds documentation generally provides for certain penalties in the event that an investor in the fund fails to meet a call.
There istypically a grace period during which interest accrues on the unpaid amount.
If the default continues, the investor may become subject to various sanctions, including termination of the investors right to participate in future investments, loss of its entitlement to distributions or income but not its liability for losses or expenses, mandatory transfer or sale of its interest, continuing liability for the principal and interest in respect of the defaulted amount and partial or total forfeiture of the investors interest.
In addition, the GP or manager may have other rights and remedies including legal remedies.
The investor may also remain liable for future calls in respect of the relevant fund as and when they are made.
There can be no assurance as to the price which may be achieved in any mandatory transfer or sale following a default on a call.
Certain funds give the GP or manager the right to proceed directly to forfeiture proceedings following notice and continuation of default by an investor.
In the case of a forfeiture, the share of the fund held by the defaulting investor would generally be allocated among the GP or manager and the remaining investors.
Inaddition, the investor may remain liable for the defaulted amount.
Consequently, any failure by SVG Capital to meet any call may have a material adverse effect on the value of SVG Capitals interest in afund and or on the net asset value of SVG Capital and or on SVG Capitals ability to generate returns for its shareholders.
In addition, afailure to meet a call may result in a cross-default under the Revolving Credit Facility which could result in a substantial loss.
If another investor or limited partner in a fund in which the Group holds an interest were to default on a call, this may result in the other investors including the Group in the fund in question becoming subject to individual calls of a larger amount but subject to each investors original capital commitment and, in addition, the fund in question may make fewer or smaller or more highly leveraged investments.
Any such occurrence may lead to a reduction in the diversication of the Groups interests in underlying portfolio companies, increase volatility, increase the Groups nancing requirements and may have an adverse effect on the Groups business and prospects.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 89 27 Risk continued Investment holding period risk Investment in private equity requires a long-term commitment with no certainty of return.
Most of the investments made by the Group are illiquid holdings in private equity funds and, in some cases, may not be capable of being realised in atimely manner or at all, dependent on prevailing market conditions.
The timing of cash distributions, if any, made by the private equity funds is uncertain and unpredictable.
Prevailing market conditions may signicantly inuence a GPs ability to achieve exits.
Subdued market conditions may result in GP delaying the sale of portfolio companies until conditions improve.
Moreover, certain exit routes may be more challenged in these conditions, such as the IPO route.
A GPs ability to realise its interest in certain portfolio companies in whole or in part may be subject to contractual restrictions such as shareholder lock-up arrangements.
It may therefore be the case that the Group decides to pay calls with debt finance rather than relying upon receiving distributions from investments which it has made which may therefore increase the Groups borrowings and, in turn, riskand volatility for shareholders.
Disposals of a fund interest could have a long lead time since there is only a limited market for secondary sales of private equity investments.
Further, sales or other transfers of interests in private equity funds sometimes require the written consent of the GP of the fund, the granting of which is at its discretion.
Accordingly, the Group may not be able to sellitsinvestments in private equity funds attheir net asset value.
The Groups portfolio is fairly concentrated with respect to private equity fund managers as explained previously and this may impact the ability to place a large holding of a single fund on the secondary market at any one time.
These factors relating to investment holding contribute to the overall liquidity and funding risks faced by the Group, which the Board manages by regularly and reviewing cash ow forecasts and the funding options available.
Portfolio company risks Since the Group invests through private equity funds in portfolio companies, the risks experienced by the portfolio companies will closely affect the returns earned by the Group and the trading price and value of its ordinary shares.
The risks which the portfolio companies may experience, and the risks posed by an investment in such companies, include: k these companies may be highly leveraged and subject to significant debt service obligations, stringent operating and financial covenants and a higher risk of default under nancing and other contractual arrangements, which would lead to severe adverse consequences for the relevant portfolio company and the value of the Groups investment in such company if a default were tooccur: k the valuations of highly leveraged companies are typically more sensitive to changes in value in public company comparable earnings multiples, declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.
Therisk of loss associated with a highly leveraged company is generally far greater than for companies with comparatively less debt: k they may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt facilities, or to renance debtfacilities when they fall due, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities in which the Group is ultimately invested: k they may require significant additional capital investment or operational or management support to improve their operations, nanceexpansions or maintain their competitive positions.
Such investment and support may not be forthcoming: k often, little public information exists about these companies and investors in these companies generally must rely on information obtained by the GP, or other manager, of the relevant fund which holds the portfolio company: k reliance is placed on the GP as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during any due diligence exercise conducted priorto an investment being made.
The GP, or relevant manager, of the fund in question may have made judgements concerning themateriality of contingent or actual risks or liabilities identied during due diligence that may not in practice turn out to have beenaccurate: k the purchase agreements relating to the investment in question may contain only limited representations and warranties from therelevant vendors and these may be limited in, for example, time and amount.
Such contractual protection would typically not beaddressed to the Group directly and, in any case, there can be no assurance as to the ability of the relevant vendor to satisfy anyclaims which may be made under any such agreement: 90 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the accounts continued 27 Risk continued k general operating risks arising from or being, amongst other matters, the cost of goods and services, difficulty in obtaining customers, losses arising from customer failure, market developments, competition risk, key man risk, foreign exchange risk, nancing risks, anincrease in costs and the legal and regulatory framework within which the portfolio company operates: k there are likely to be prior claims on the assets of portfolio companies from debt providers which would reduce the amounts earned by the equity holders including, indirectly, the Group: and k lenders to portfolio companies may take actions which are adverse to the interests of the holders of equity interests in the portfolio company including, indirectly, the Group.
The value of the portfolio companies held by the funds in which the Group holds interests may be affected by uncertainties, such aspolitical developments, changes in government policies, regulations, laws, taxation, currency uctuations, currency repatriation and other restrictions, in some of the countries in which the funds may invest.
The Group, directly or indirectly through the funds in which the Group holds interests, may also be exposed to these risks.
The Group receives investment recommendations from SVGCM, who performs extensive due diligence on the private equity managers that it invests with, who in turn select and oversee underlying investee companies.
Passive investor with limited recourse The Group is generally a passive investor and has limited powers under the governing documents of the funds in which it holds interests.
The funds concerned are, within certain broad parameters, generally authorised to follow broad investment guidelines and, subject thereto, are able to invest in geographies, industries and investment opportunities at their discretion.
The Group does not review each proposed investment and is, subject to certain limited exceptions, unable to refuse to meet a call without suffering the consequences of a default.
There can be no assurance that the strategies adopted by GPs or managers ofthe funds in which the Group holds interests will be successful or that the portfolio companies of such funds, or the Groups investments generally, willappreciate in value.
The Group also holds some investments in funds in respect of which associated undertakings are the GP, manager and or adviser.
In these instances, duciary duties are owed by the associated undertakings to other investors which, together with the terms of the relevant fund management or advisory agreement, mean that the relevant associated undertakings are unable to submit each proposed investment for review by the Group which will, therefore, remain a passive investor in respect of the relevant fund.
The Group cannot make claims against GPs or managers of the funds in which the Group invests even in cases ofpoor performance except in very limited circumstances typically involving severe culpability on the part of the GP or manager.
The Groups recourse in the event of poor performance of the funds concerned is highly restricted.
Removal of the GP or manager of a fund generally requires a high level of investor participation and consent with the relevant threshold often being set so as to require the consent of holders of 75% of the capital committed to the fund in question.
The Group is unlikely tobeable to procure such participation and consent on its own and it may therefore be very difficult to remove a GP or manager of a fund in which the Group invests such that the Group may potentially nd itself locked into an under-performing fund.
The fund documentation relating to certain funds contain no provision for the removal of the GP or manager by vote of the limited partners save in circumstances involving severe culpability.
Even if those circumstances were to arise, which the Group considers to be unlikely, the consent of a special majority of limited partners would be required which the Group is unlikely to beable to procure on its own.
Once the Group has made a capital commitment to a fund, it may be difficult to terminate its participation or reduce its capital commitment even if the investment returns arising from that fund are poor or not competitive.
In circumstances of severe culpability, the Group may have a valid claim against GPs or managers, though it may not be clear whether those GPs or managers will have sufficient substance, or whether professional indemnity insurance is in place, to meet such claims.
Fund investments are often made relying, in part, on key individuals that have played a significant role in the returns generated by that manager in the past.
The governing documents of such funds typically contain provisions that address what happens in the event of incapacity or withdrawal of such individuals providing partial treatment of the risk.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 91 27 Risk continued Regulatory risks The regulatory environment in which the Group operates is increasingly complex and the Group faces a number of regulatory risks.
Breaches of regulations such as the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and damage theGroups reputation.
Breaches of controls by service providers could also lead to reputational damage or loss.
Key regulatory risks havebeen identied and appropriate monitoring of such risks is undertaken regularly on behalf of the Board.
During the year, SVGCM, the investment manager and a Group subsidiary, was authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
There are a number of legislative initiatives to increase regulation of the alternative investments sector including private equity.
Such legislation has not been nalised, however there is a risk that such legislation, when enacted, could materially affect the business ofthe Company or its subsidiaries.
Taxation risk Any change in the taxation legislation or practice could affect the value of the Groups investments and as a result, its performance.
Abreach of Section 1158 of the United Kingdom Corporation Tax Act 2010 could result in the Group or Company being subject to corporation tax on realised gains on the sale of portfolio investments which would have a material adverse effect on the net returns earned by SVG Capital.
However, the Group has strict controls in place to ensure that it complies with the requirements of Section 1158 and contracts with specialist tax advisers to provide advice on changes to tax regulation and practice.
However, there can be no guarantee in advance that the Group or Company will satisfy the conditions for approval by HMRC as an investment trust under Section1158 or that the Group or Company will not become a close company, which would result in its being unable to qualify as an investment trust for tax purposes.
