4.0 SCOPE 3 VOLUNTARY SUPPLY CHAIN GHG EMISSIONS Scope 3 supply chain emissions represent GHG emissions during electricity supplier transmission and distribution to our stores.
See page 54 for their independent assurance report.
Note: Peak energy use and benchmark year was 2011.
Note: Transmission and Distribution Conversion Factor 2016 0.03816.
Our energy efficiency programmes within our stores have reduced electricity demand and emission from our suppliers power stations.
Total transmission and distribution losses have reduced by 35.8% since 2011, compared to a 28.9% reduction last year.
Waste generation in self storage is assessed as a low environmental impact.
The majority of non-hazardous bulk office waste is segregated by our staff and then further recycling by our waste contractor for paper and cardboard takes place after collection.
This year 296 tonnes of waste was recycled and 58.9 tonnes went to landfill.
Landfill GHG emissions are estimated to be 17.0 tCO e. These emission levels 2 represent a negligible percentage of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are below the materiality threshold for future carbon emission reporting.

All of our new stores sign up to the Considerate Constructors Scheme and achieve Energy Performance Certification EPC B rating with LED lighting as standard and roof top solar installations installed where viable.
Water use has been assessed as a low environmental impact for self storage usage of 28,486 m3.
Our data has provided an average of 20.3 tCO e emissions per year.
This represents less than 0.5% of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which is below the materiality 2 threshold for carbon emissions.
Water use monitoring is continued in order to review water use efficiency.
