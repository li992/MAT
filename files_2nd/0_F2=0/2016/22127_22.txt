116 116 Capco Capco Annual R Annual Re eport & port & Accounts 2016 Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 14 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED At 31 December 2016, the Group was contractually committed to 149.2 million 2015: 162.5 million of future expenditure for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property.
Refer to note 28 Capital Commitments for further information on capital commitments.
The fair value of the Groups investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2016 was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers, Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties excluding the Empress State Building and Venues: and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups property portfolio.
The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
Each year the Executive Directors, on behalf of the Board, appoint the external valuers.
The valuers are selected based upon their knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group.
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Groups portfolio.
At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs.
Valuers submit and present summary reports to the Groups Audit Committee, with the Executive Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome of each valuation round.
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition.
The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs including any site specific costs for example Section 106, professional fees, planning fees, developers profit including contingencies, planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
A number of the Groups properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the development.
Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developers profit before arriving at a valuation.
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties, the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a residential led scheme.
The property is currently used as an office space, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to achieve the change in use is being implemented.
Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have also been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion to residential use or for improving the configuration of retail units.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place.
These restrictions are factored into the propertys valuation by the external valuer.
Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 17.
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13.
Trading property is exempted from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements.
The different valuation levels are defined as: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets: Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices: and Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from Level 3 to Level 2.
All investment and development property held by the Group are classified as Level 3. www.

Conversely, an increased equivalent yield of 25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of 159.8 million 2015: 149.3 million.
A decreased equivalent yield of 25 basis points would result in an increased asset valuation of 182.9 million 2015: 172.8 million.
These inputs are interdependent, partially determined by market conditions.
The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between the two inputs.
An increase in estimated rental value occurring in conjunction with an increase in equivalent yield could result in no net impact to the valuation.
An increase in the estimated construction costs included in a residual development valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 238.1 million 2015: 235.9 million.
A decrease in the estimated construction costs included in a residual development valuation of 10 per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 239.4 million 2015: 239.4 million.
An increase in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 22.4 million 2015: 28.7 million.
A decrease in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 38.4 million 2015: 35.7 million.

The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate caps protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the caps ceiling.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
com 125 125 Notes to the accounts continued 25 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint ventures.
The table is calculated on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
Fixed Capped Floating Fixed Capped Floating 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m m 1 Nominal value of Group borrowings excluding finance leases 325.0 517.9 150.0 472.5 Nominal value of joint venture borrowings excluding finance leases 77.6 43.8 Nominal value of non-controlling interest borrowings excluding finance leases 12.0 325.0 583.5 150.0 516.3 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 455.9 455.9 453.0 453.0 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 780.9 127.6 603.0 63.3 Interest rate protection 86% 91% 1 Excludes current loan notes of 6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing.
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective at 31 December 2016 was 2.2 per cent 2015: 2.2 per cent.
In 2016, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising on 60 million of outstanding debt from 2016 to 2026.
The loss recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was 1.2 million.
This loss will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt.
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2016 is nil.
The hedge was 100 per cent effective: therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point bps shift, upwards and downwards, in the level of interest rates on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Increase in interest Decrease in interest Increase in interest Decrease in interest rates by 50 bp rates by 50 bp rates by 50 bp rates by 50 bp 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m m Effect on profit before tax: Increase decrease 10.4 10.4 5.1 5.1 The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entitys ability to meet the relevant facilitys financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
This was the strategy employed in the refinancing of existing borrowings in 2016.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from joint ventures, loan notes and cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained.
Trade and other receivables: Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Trade receivables are less than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2016 2015: less than 1 per cent and no one tenant accounts for more than 10 per cent of rental income.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2016 was 7.8 million 2015: 7.3 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
In relation to the Groups revenue from licencing fees, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full.
Additionally, specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2016 2015 m m Up to 90 days 7.3 6.6 Over 90 days 0.6 Trade receivables 7.9 6.6 In 2016 there was an impairment write down on trade receivables of 0.6 million 2015: 0.1 million.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk.
However, this is mitigated by the extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above.
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: Included within receivables is 7.0 million 2015: 10.0 million of amounts advanced to LSJV.
The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is nil 2015: nil as the Groups share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment.
Total funding advanced to LSJV, excluding the deep discount bonds, of 53.2 million 2015: 41.5 million has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture by 46.3 million 2015: 31.5 million.
com 127 127 Notes to the accounts continued 25 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and market value.
However based on a market valuation undertaken by the Groups valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, there is an unrecognised surplus of 46.6 million Group share as at 31 December 2016.
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when significant risks and rewards have transferred to the buyer.
Therefore, while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the Group is required to impair amounts advanced to LSJV until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale.
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments: The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties.
The maximum exposure to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2016 amounted to 31.1 million 2015: 67.7 million.
Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These ratios are disclosed on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
These metrics are discussed in the Financial Review on pages 40 to 46.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13.
The tables below present the Groups financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.

The valuation of the available-for-sale investment is based on expected cash distributions to be received from China Harvest Fund 1 with reference to the market value of the underlying assets held.
During the year the final proceeds were received by the Group.
The China Harvest Fund 1 is expected to be liquidated in 2017.
The fair values of the Groups cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are not materially different from those at which they are carried in the financial statements.
The table below presents a reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements for the year.

Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the properties original tax base cost.
Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Groups holding structure.
The Groups recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is nil at 31 December 2016 2015: 15.6 million.
The Groups contingent tax liability on investment properties, calculated on the same tax base cost as above but based on a deemed market value disposal at year end, is nil 2015: 17.6 million.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties including Lillie Square at their market value as per note 14 Property Portfolio would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 9.6 million 20.0 per cent of 48.1 million.

In March 2013, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London Line where it runs within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area.
Within the terms of the agreement, the Group can exercise options during the next 50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development within the Earls Court Masterplan.
Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan.
Any further payments to Network Rail will be treated as contingent rent as per note 23 Finance Lease Obligations.
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land, the vendors successor in title is entitled to further payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met.
Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission for change of use or on disposal.
In the event such planning permission is implemented, the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the uplift in land value following the grant of the permission.
In the event of a disposal, the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the difference between the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

32 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives.
Approval of a new remuneration policy and Performance Share Plan will be sought at the 2017 AGM.
All disclosures in this note refer to the previous long-term incentive arrangement.
All schemes are equity settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Groups equity instruments at the grant date of the share awards.
The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based payments for 2016 was 1.1 million 2015: 4.6 million.
Reconciliations of movements in share incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 133 to 134.
Performance share plan Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the Group Performance Share Plan PSP.
Exercise at the vesting date is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee at the time of grant.
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: the Groups Total Return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR Performance Period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR Performance Period re-invested in ordinary shares.
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 72, 73, 81 and 82.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.
132 132 Capco Capco Annual R Annual Re eport & port & Accounts 2016 Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements 32 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of 10 years.
In general, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC as a Company Share Option Plan CSOP scheme: therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as approved options.

Matching share plan Under the Group Matching Share Plan MSP, deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus.
These awards may also be made as nil cost options.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award.
Awards of nil cost options were made in both the current and comparative periods.
The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date.

The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred.
In exceptional circumstances the matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred.
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions.
Vesting of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally determined.
The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Matching nil cost options and share awards generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or deferred shares.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the MSP was 0.5 million 2015: 1.9 million.

Fair value of share-based payment As stated above, one half of each award granted is subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the TR performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the TSR performance condition.

Current pension arrangements The Venues business has a hybrid pension scheme comprising a money purchase section that was closed on 28 February 2014 and a final salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011.
The final salary section is a funded defined benefit scheme the Scheme which is contracted out of State Second Pension.
On closure of the money purchase section of the Venues pension scheme, a defined contribution group personal pension plan was offered to eligible Venues employees.
The Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met.
As part of the process the Company must agree with the Trustee of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective.
The Scheme is managed by a board of Trustees the Trustee appointed in part by the Company and part from elections by members of the Scheme.
The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the Scheme, administering benefit payments and investing the Schemes assets.
The Trustee delegates some of these functions to professional advisers where appropriate.
The Groups current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements.
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: Investment risk the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficit emerges.
Interest rate risk the Schemes liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
Inflation risk a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation.
Although the Schemes assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging.
Mortality risk in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.
Member options Certain benefit options may be exercised by members without requiring the consent of the Trustee or the Company, for example exchanging pension for cash at retirement.

As a result, a discount rate of 2.8 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2016 2015: 3.7 per cent.
This is lower than the rate used in the prior year, reflecting the significant drop in the yields on bonds of the appropriate term over this period.
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from time to time to reflect current trends.
The standard table used by the Scheme in the current period is S2 PXA CMI 1.25% 2015: S1 PXA CMI 1.50%, and Year of Birth.
The table below makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member.
