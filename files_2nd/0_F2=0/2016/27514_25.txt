Belgium and the Group engagement team.
We tested manual and automated journal entries for all 8 components where we performed full or specific scope audit.
The scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group.
Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the Group financial statements.
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 16 reporting components of the Group, we selected 8 components covering entities within the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, United Kingdom and Kazakhstan, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
The Group engagement team performed the audit of the consolidation in the United Kingdom.
Of the eight components selected, we performed a full scope audit of three components full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
For the remaining five components specific scope components, we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The three full scope components account for 100% of the Groups revenue and 108% of the Groups EBITDA.
The EBITDA coverage of 108% represents one full scope component having a positive contribution of 122% offset by two Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual report 2016 128 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 129 Consolidated financial statements Independent auditors report to the members of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC full scope components having a negative contribution of 14%.
The specific scope locations do not have income generating activities and we audited cash, payroll, general and administrative costs, the employee share option plan and other current liabilities.
Of the remaining eight components having together a negative contribution of 1% of the Groups EBITDA, none are individually greater than 1% of the Groups EBITDA.
For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, inquiry procedures and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
For the two full scope components in Kazakhstan and Belgium, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current years audit cycle we held a global audit team event led by the Senior Statutory Auditor, where the primary audit team and the component teams met in London, United Kingdom, to consider the audit risk and strategy.
The Senior Statutory Auditor and key members of the primary team visited the component team in Kazakhstan to attend the component closing meeting with local management, visited the operating field and the third unit of the gas treatment facility construction site and reviewed key working papers.
The primary team was ultimately responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.
Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with the component teams in Kazakhstan and Belgium throughout the current years audit cycle.
The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$3.2 million 2015: US$3.6 million, which is 3% of EBITDA 2015: 5% of profit before tax.
We have used an earnings based measure as our basis of materiality.
For the current year audit it was considered inappropriate to calculate materiality using Group profit or loss before tax due to the recent volatility of this metric following significant decline in oil and gas prices.
EBITDA is a key performance indicator for the Group and is also a key metric used by the Group in the assessment of the performance of management.
We noted that market and analyst commentary on the performance of the Group uses EBITDA as a key metric.
We therefore considered EBITDA to be the most appropriate performance metric on which to base our materiality calculation as we evaluated that to be the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the Group.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual report 2016 129 130 | Consolidated financial statements Independent auditors report to the members of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% 2015: 50% of our planning materiality, namely US$1.6m 2015: US$1.8m.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a higher risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was US$0.2m to US$1.2m 2015: US$0.2m to US$1.4m.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$0.2m 2015: US$0.2m, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the parent companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and nonfinancial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 139 Annual report 2016 140 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements adopted by the European Union and the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules DTR of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA in the United Kingdom as applicable to annual financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value as stated in the accounting policies Note 4.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand, except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires from management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2016.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control.
To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee: rights arising from other contractual arrangements: the Groups voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Group reorganisation The Group has been formed through a reorganisation that took place in June 2014 in which Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC became a new parent entity of the Group Note 14.
The reorganisation is not a business combination and does not result in any change of economic substance of the Group.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC are a continuation of the existing group Nostrum Oil & Gas LP and its subsidiaries.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the difference in share capital as an adjustment to equity Other reserves that is not subject to reclassification to income statement in the future periods.
Going concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Group The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2016.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
The nature and the impact of each new standard or amendment which is applicable to the consolidated financial statements of the Group is described below: Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business of which the asset is part rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset.
As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets.
These amendments do not have any impact on the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements The amendment clarifies that the offsetting disclosure requirements do not apply to condensed interim financial statements, unless such disclosures provide a significant update to the information reported in the most recent annual report.
This amendment must be applied retrospectively.
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting The amendment clarifies that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the interim financial report e. g. in the management commentary or risk report.
The other information within the interim financial report must be available to users on the same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time.
This amendment does not have any impact on the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify, rather than significantly change, existing IAS 1 requirements.
The amendments clarify: The materiality requirements in IAS 1 That specific line items in the statement s of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss Furthermore, the amendments clarify the requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial position and the statement s of profit or loss and OCI.
These amendments do not have any impact on the Group.
Standards issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Groups consolidated financial statements are disclosed below.
The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 141 Annual report 2016 142 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements accounting for the financial instruments project: classification and measurement: impairment: and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required, but providing comparative information is not compulsory.
For hedge accounting, the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
During 2016, the Group performed a high-level impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9.
This preliminary assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further detailed analyses or additional reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group in the future.
Overall, the Group expects no significant impact of IFRS 9 on its balance sheet and equity.
a Classification and measurement The Group does not expect a significant impact on its balance sheet or equity on applying the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9.
It will continue measuring at fair value derivative financial instruments.
Trade receivables are held to collect contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest.
Thus, the Group expects that these will continue to be measured at amortised cost under IFRS 9. b Impairment IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis.
The Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables.
The Group does not expect a significant impact on its equity due to the average short collection period of trade receivables as well as anticipation of low trade impairment losses on trade receivables based on the historical data, but it will need to perform a more detailed analysis which considers all reasonable and supportable information, including forward-looking elements to determine the extent of the impact.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue.
The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the full retrospective method.
During 2016, the Group performed a preliminary assessment of IFRS 15, which is subject to changes arising from a more detailed ongoing analysis.
Furthermore, the Group is considering the clarification issued by the IASB in April 2016 and will monitor any further developments.
a Sale of goods The Groups revenue is driven by sale of crude oil, gas condensate and LPG.
The goods are sold on their own in separate identified contracts with customers.
Therefore, contracts with customers of the sale of goods is generally expected to be the only performance obligation are not expected to have any impact on the Groups profit or loss.
The Group expects the revenue recognition to occur at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on the delivery of the goods.
b Presentation and disclosure requirements IFRS 15 provides presentation and disclosure requirements, which are more detailed than under current IFRS.
Many of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 are completely new.
In 2016 the Group started to develop appropriate systems, internal controls, policies and procedures necessary to collect and disclose the required information.
IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 2 The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction: the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations: and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled.
On adoption, entities are required to apply the amendments without restating prior periods, but retrospective application is permitted if elected for all three amendments and other criteria are met.
The amendments are effective for annual periods Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 142 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 143 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted.
The Group is assessing the potential effect of the amendments on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, ie the customer lessee and the supplier lessor.
All leases result in a company the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining financing.
Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model.
Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognise: assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value: and depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement.
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17.
Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently.
IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 2019.
A company can choose to apply IFRS 16 before that date but only if it also applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
A lessee can chose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
The standards transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
IFRS 16 replaces the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations.
In 2017, the Group plans to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its financial statements but in broad terms, the impact will be to recognise a lease liability and a corresponding asset for most of the operating lease commitments disclosed in Note 31.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Exploration expenditure Costs directly associated with exploration wells are capitalised within exploration and evaluation assets until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated.
These costs include employee remuneration and materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors and asset retirement obligation fees.
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: Exploration expenditure If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity e. g. the drilling of additional wells, it is probable that they can be commercially developed, the costs continue to be carried as an asset while sufficient continued progress is made in assessing the commerciality of the hydrocarbons.
All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery.
When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off.
Subsoil use rights acquisition costs are initially capitalised in exploration and evaluation assets.
Subsoil use rights acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or firmly planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.
If no future activity is planned or the subsoil use rights have been relinquished or has expired, the carrying value of the subsoil use rights acquisition costs is written off through profit or loss.
The Group owns licenses in the Western Kazakhstan region, including the Rostoshinskoye,  and Darjinskoye fields where the exploration period will expire in 2017.
The Groups application for extension of the exploration period on the Rostoshinskoye field is under approval by the MOE and will seek extension on the terms for the  and Darjinskoye fields in 2017.
The Group remains committed to developing its exploration assets and based on the past history of the Groups ability to obtain extension, therefore, continues to carry Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 143 Annual report 2016 144 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements the capitalized costs on its balance sheet.
For more detailed information in relation to the subsoil use rights terms, please see Note 1.
Judgement is also required when determining the appropriate grouping of the exploration assets into a CGU when assessing their recoverable amounts.
The management has determined all three exploration fields as a single cash generating unit.
Upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and gas properties.
For more detailed information in relation to exploration and evaluation assets, please see Note 6.
Property, plant and equipment Oil and gas properties Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as treatment facilities, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment as oil and gas properties.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation and the initial estimate of decommissioning obligation, if any.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
When a development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain construction development costs ceases and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements or new developments All capitalised costs of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed reserves of the field, except the Group depreciates its oil pipeline and oil loading terminal on a straight line basis over the life of the relevant subsoil use rights.
In the case of assets that have a useful life shorter than the lifetime of the field the straight line method is applied.
Other properties All other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit or loss during the year in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Years Buildings and constructions 7-15 Vehicles 8 Machinery and equipment 3-13 Other 3-10 For more detailed information in relation to property plant and equipment, please refer to Note 7.
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: oil and gas reserves Oil and gas reserves are a material factor in the Groups computation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation the DD&A.
These reserve quantities are used for calculating the unit of production depletion rate as it reflects the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits by the Group.
The Group uses the internal estimates confirmed by independent reserve engineers on an annual basis to assess the oil and gas reserves of its oil and gas fields.
The reserves estimates are made in accordance with the methodology of the Society of Petroleum Engineers the SPE.
In estimating its reserves under the SPE methodology, the Group uses long-term planning prices which are also used by management to make investment decisions about development of a field.
Using planning prices for estimating proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in using year-end spot prices.
Management believes that long-term planning price assumptions are more consistent with the long-term Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 144 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 145 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements nature of the upstream business and provide the most appropriate basis for estimating oil and gas reserves.
All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty.
The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data.
The relative degree of uncertainty can be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
Proved reserves are more certain to be recovered than unproved reserves and may be further sub-classified as developed and undeveloped to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability.
Estimates are reviewed and revised annually.
Revisions occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geological, reservoir or production data: availability of new data: or changes to underlying price assumptions.
Reserve estimates may also be revised due to improved recovery projects, changes in production capacity or changes in development strategy.
Proved developed reserves are used to calculate the unit of production rates for DD&A, whereby changes in proved reserves are dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production.
Downward revision of the proved reserves estimates in the future could lead to relative increase in depreciation expense.
Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows also impact the impairment assessment of the Group.
Details on carrying values of oil and gas properties and related depreciation, depletion and amortization are shown in Note 7. Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest NCI in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure NCI in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Those acquired petroleum reserves and resources that can be reliably measured are recognised separately in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably measured, are not recognised separately, but instead are subsumed in goodwill.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for NCI over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred bargain purchase, before recognising a gain, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date.
If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a Cash Generating Unit CGU and part of the operation in that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 145 Annual report 2016 146 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Impairment of property, plant and equipment, exploration and evaluation assets and goodwill The Group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units CGUs, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable: for example, changes in the Groups business plans, significant decreases in the market commodity prices, low plant utilisation, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Individual assets are grouped into CGU for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
A CGUs recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates.
When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
For more detailed information in relation to goodwill, please refer to Note 5.
The business cash flow internal model, which is approved on an annual basis by senior management, is the primary source of information for the determination of value in use.
It contains forecasts for oil and gas production, sales volumes for various types of products, revenues, costs and capital expenditure.
As an initial step in the preparation of this model, various assumptions are set by senior management.
These assumptions take account of commodity prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group and are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax rate.
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: impairment of property, plant and equipment, exploration and evaluation assets and goodwill Management has determined a single cash-generating unit within the Groups non-current assets consisting of all Groups assets related to its Chinarevskoye and exploration fields and gas treatment facility.
Determination as to whether, and by how much, the CGU containing goodwill is impaired involves managements best estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, operating expenses and capital expenditures estimates, discount rate, future production volumes and fiscal regimes.
The recoverable amount is determined by calculation of the value-in-use based on the discounted cash flow model as no recent third party transactions exist on which a reliable market-based fair value can be established.
The value-in-use calculation model takes into consideration cashflows, which are expected to arise until 2032, i. e. during the license term of the Chinarevskoye field.
The period exceeding five years is believed to be appropriate based on the proved and probable reserves audited by independent engineers and respective past history of the Groups ability to transfer probable reserves into proved.
The recoverability of exploration assets is covered under Exploration expenditure above.
The key assumptions used in the Groups discounted cash flow model reflecting past experience and taking in account of external factors are subject to periodic review.
These assumptions are: Oil prices in real terms : US$55 bbl for 2017 and US$60 bbl for 2018-2032: Proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves confirmed by independent reserve engineers: Production profiles based on Groups internal estimates confirmed by independent reserve engineers: All cash flows are projected on the basis of stable prices, i. e. inflation growth rates are ignored: Cost profiles for the development of the fields and subsequent operating costs consistent with reserves estimates and production profiles: and Pre-tax discount rate of 14.1% 2015: 14.0% : Completion of the third unit for the gas treatment facility in 2017 resulting in gradual increase in the annual production volumes from 40,351 boepd in 2016 to approximately 100,000 boepd by the end of 2019.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 146 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 147 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements These estimates may have a material impact on the value in use and, respective impairment, e. g. low oil prices for an extended period might lead to impairment charges.
Even though the Group recognised a loss during the current year, mainly caused by the low oil prices, its operating cash flow remained strong.
Short-term fluctuations in the oil prices are not considered to be indicative taking into account the long-lived nature of the Groups assets.
A 100 basis points increase in the pre-tax rate to 15% would result in no additional impairment charges.
None of the reasonably possible changes in other key assumptions causes the cash generating units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
More detailed information related to carrying values of oil and gas properties and related depreciation, depletion and amortisation are shown in Note 7.
For information related to goodwill, please refer to Note 5.
Taxation Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income.
Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax bases of income and expense already recorded.
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which it operates.
The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the Group and the responsible tax authority.
Such differences in interpretation may arise for a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies.
Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that apply to the relevant taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of profit or loss.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred income tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
For more detailed information in current and deferred income tax disclosure as at 31 December 2016 and 2015, please see Note 27.
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: taxation Kazakhstans tax legislation and regulations are subject to ongoing changes and varying interpretations.
Instances of inconsistent opinions between local, regional and national tax authorities are not unusual.
Because of the uncertainties associated with Kazakhstans tax system, the ultimate amount of taxes, penalties and interest, if any, may be in excess of the amount expensed to date and accrued at 31 December 2016.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 147 Annual report 2016 148 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements The Group is subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations are discussed and agreed with the tax authorities.
Whilst the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of provisions required for taxes for which it is considered probable will be payable, based on professional advice and consideration of the nature of current discussions with the tax authority.
As at 31 December 2016 management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Groups tax position will be sustained.
To the extent that actual outcomes differ from managements estimates, income tax charges or credits, and changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise in future periods.
For more information, see Note 27.
Foreign currency translation The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar the US dollar or US$.
The functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries are as follows: Company Functional currency Grandstil LLC Russian rouble Nostrum Associated Investments LLP Tenge Nostrum E&P Services LLC Russian rouble Nostrum Oil & Gas Coperatief U.
US dollar Nostrum Oil & Gas BV US dollar Nostrum Oil & Gas UK Ltd. British Pound Nostrum Services Central Asia LLP Tenge Nostrum Services N. V. Euro Zhaikmunai LLP US dollar Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Groups subsidiaries at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
All differences are taken to the profit or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange.
In the consolidated financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries are translated into US dollars are reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Advances for non-current assets Advances paid for capital investments acquisition of non-current assets are qualified as advances for non-current assets regardless of the period of supplies of relevant assets or the supply of work or services to close advances.
Advances paid for the purchase of non-current assets are recognised by the Group as non-current assets and are not discounted.
For more detailed information in relation to advances for non-current assets, please refer to Note 8.
Borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs on qualifying assets.
Assets qualifying for borrowing costs capitalisation include all assets under construction that are not being depreciated, depleted, or amortised, provided that work is in progress at that time.
Qualifying assets mostly include wells and other operations field infrastructure under construction.
Capitalised borrowing costs are calculated by applying the capitalisation rate to the expenditures on qualifying assets.
The capitalisation Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 148 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 149 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the Groups borrowings that are outstanding during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred.
For more detailed information in relation to capitalisation of borrowing costs, please refer to Note 7.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value NRV.
Cost of oil, gas condensate and liquefied petroleum gas LPG is determined on the weighted-average method based on the production cost including the relevant expenses on depreciation, depletion and impairment and overhead costs based on production volume.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling expenses.
For more information in relation to the breakdown of inventories as at 31 December 2016 and 2015, please see Note 9.
Provisions and contingencies Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed by the Group at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.
The Group classifies as contingent liabilities those possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise and the present obligations that arise from past events but are not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
The Group does not recognise contingent liabilities but discloses contingent liabilities in Note 31, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.
Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full, when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that provision can be made.
The Group estimates future dismantlement and site restoration costs for oil and gas properties with reference to the estimates provided from either internal or external engineers after taking into consideration the anticipated method of dismantlement and the extent of site restoration required in accordance with current legislation and industry practice.
The amount of the provision is the present value of the estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at current year prices adjusted for expected long-term inflation rate and discounted at applicable rate.
The unwinding of the discount related to the obligation is recorded in finance costs.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil and gas properties.
This asset is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the oil and gas properties on a unit-of-production basis.
The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each financial reporting date and adjusts them to reflect current best estimates in accordance with IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.
Changes in the measurement of an existing decommissioning liability that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation, or changes to the discount rate: are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period.
If deducted from the cost of the asset the amount deducted shall not exceed its carrying amount.
If a decrease in the provision exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised immediately in the profit or loss: and if the adjustment results in an addition to the cost of an asset, the Group considers whether this is an indication that the new carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
If it is such an indication, the Group tests the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and accounts for any impairment loss in accordance with IAS 36.
Movements in the abandonment and site restoration provision are disclosed in Note 16.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 149 Annual report 2016 150 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: provisions and contingencies Provisions and liabilities are recognized in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cash outflow can be reliably estimated.
The timing of recognition and quantification of the liability require the application of judgment to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change.
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and adjusted to take account of changing facts and circumstances.
Significant management judgment is required to evaluate any claims and actions to determine whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised, or a contingent liability is required to be disclosed, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.
The Group holds provision for the future decommissioning of oil and gas properties and site restoration.
The estimation of the future dismantlement and site restoration costs involves significant estimates and judgments by management.
Significant judgments in making such estimates include estimates of future cash outflows timing and discount rate.
Management made its estimates based on the assumption that cash flow will take place at the expected end of the subsoil use rights.
Therefore, the most decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise date of wells abandonment and site restoration may change with the relative impact on the cash outflows.
Management of the Group believes that the long-term interest rates on the Eurobonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan provides the best estimates of applicable risk uncorrected discount rate.
Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and the asset.
Moreover, actual decommissioning costs can differ from estimates because of constantly changing decommissioning technologies as well as changes in environmental laws and regulations and public expectations.
The Group believes that the impact of any reasonably foreseeable change to these provisions on the Groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity will not be material.
For more details on abandonment and site restoration provision please refer to Note 16.
Other current liabilities The Group makes accruals for liabilities related to the underperformance and or adjustments of work programs under subsoil use agreements SUA on a regular basis.
When evaluating the adequacy of an accrual, management bases its estimates on the latest work program included in the SUA, and relevant signed supplements and potential future changes in payment terms including the currency in which these liabilities are to be settled.
Future changes in the work programs may require adjustments to the accrual recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
Financial assets Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace regular way trades are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Groups financial assets include cash, long-term and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables.
Financial assets are fide-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 150 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 151 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost the Group assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit or loss.
Financial assets together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery.
If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account.
If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to finance costs in the profit or loss.
Financial liabilities Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition All financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables and borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance cost in the profit or loss.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses hedging contracts for oil export sales to cover part of its risks associated with oil price fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to profit or loss.
For more detailed information in relation to derivative financial instruments, please refer to Note 28 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 151 Annual report 2016 152 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions: fair value of financial instruments The fair value measurement of the Groups financial and non-financial assets and liabilities utilises market observable inputs and data as far as possible.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated using Black-Scholes valuation model based on Brent Crude Futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Significant management judgment is required to estimate expected volatility used in the internal valuation model.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Changes in the key assumptions may have a material impact on the fair value gains and losses on derivatives recognised in the future reporting periods.
The detail information on the derivative financial instruments and their fair value sensitivity to changes in volatilities and oil price assumptions is provided in Note 32.
Cash and short-term deposits Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and at hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, but exclude any restricted cash which is not available for use by the Group and therefore is not considered highly liquid for example, cash set aside to cover decommissioning obligations.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
For more detailed information in relation to cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2016 and 2015, please see Note 12.
Revenue recognition The Group sells crude oil, gas condensate and LPG under agreements priced by reference to Platts and or Argus index quotations and adjusted for freight, insurance and quality differentials where applicable.
The Group sells gas under agreements at fixed prices.
Revenue from the sale of crude oil, gas condensate, gas and LPG is recognised when delivery has taken place and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer.
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in other reserves.
Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no distributions are accepted in relation to them.
Share options exercised during the reporting period are satisfied with treasury shares.
Share-based payments The Group measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.
This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and distribution yield and making assumptions about them.
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 25.

The rights and obligations in relation to this option plan were transferred to Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC from Nostrum Oil & Gas LP following the reorganisation Note 2.
Employees including senior executives and executive directors of members of the Group or their associates receive remuneration in the form of equity-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for share appreciation rights, which can only be settled in cash cash-settled transactions.
The cost of cash-settled equity-based employee compensation is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a trinomial lattice valuation model.
This fair value is expensed over the period until vesting with the recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The equity-based payment plan is described below.
During 2008-2015, 4,297,958 equity appreciation rights SARs which can only be settled in cash were granted to senior employees and executive directors of members of the Group or their associates.
These generally vest over a five year period from the date of grant, so that one fifth of granted SARs vests on each of the five anniversaries from the date of grant.
The contractual life of the SARs is ten years.
The fair value of the SARs is measured at the grant date using a trinomial lattice valuation option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
SARs are exercisable at any time after vesting till the end of the contractual life and give its holder a right to a difference between the market value of the Groups ordinary shares at the date of exercise and a stated base value.
The services received and a liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period.
Until the liability is settled it is remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss as part of the employee benefit expenses arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
The carrying value of the liability relating to 2,536,478 of SARs at 31 December 2016 is US$ 4,339 thousand 31 December 2015: 2,611,413 SARs with carrying value of US$ 4,284 thousand.

The weighted average price at the date of exercise for SARs exercised during the year ended 31 December 2016 amounted to US$ 2.06 per SAR.
The Hull-White trinomial lattice valuation model was used to value the share options.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the plan for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Price at the reporting date US$ 4.7 6.0 Distribution yield % 0% 3.0% Expected volatility % 45.0% 45.0% Risk-free interest rate % 1.2% 2.5% Expected life years 10 10 Option turnover % 10.0% 10.0% Price trigger 2.0 2.0 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
Option turnover rate represents the rate of employees expected to leave the Company during the vesting period, which is based on historical data and is may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The model considers that when share price reaches the level of exercise price multiplied by the price trigger the employees are expected to exercise their options.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, payables to Government of Kazakhstan, trade payables and other current liabilities.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the development of the Chinarevskoye oil and gas condensate field and its operations as well as exploration of the three new oil and gas fields Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and .
The Group's financial assets consist of trade and other receivables, noncurrent investments, current investments and cash and cash equivalents.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and commodity price risk.
The Groups management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in price of crude oil, which is quoted in US dollar on the international markets.
The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of crude oil prices in the future.
Interest rate risk The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk in 2016 and 2015 as the Group had no financial instruments with floating rates as at years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015.
Foreign currency risk As a significant portion of the Groups operation is the tenge denominated, the Groups statement of financial position can be affected by movements in the US dollar tenge exchange rates.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposure by borrowing in US dollars and denominating sales in US dollars.

Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.
The tool allows selecting severe stress test scenarios.
To ensure an adequate level of liquidity a minimum cash balance has been defined as a cushion of liquid assets.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of notes, loans, hedges, export financing and financial leases.
The Groups policy is that, while it has an investment program on-going: a not more than 25% of borrowings should mature in the next twelve-month period and b a minimum balance of US$ 50 million is retained on the balance sheet post repayment or refinancing of any debt due in the next twelve-month period.
The Group's total outstanding debt consists of two notes: US$ 560 million issued in 2012 and maturing in 2019 and US$ 400 million issued in 2014 and maturing in 2019.
The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 171 Annual report 2016 172 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 based on contractual undiscounted payments: On Less than 3-12 More than As at 31 December 2016 demand 3 months months 1-5 years 5 years Total Borrowings 16,499 49,225 1,063,544 2,039 1,131,307 Trade payables 34,959 8,361 43,320 Other current liabilities 18,344 18,344 Due to Government of Kazakhstan 258 773 4,124 9,536 14,691 53,303 16,757 58,359 1,067,668 11,575 1,207,662 On Less than 3-12 More than As at 31 December 2015 demand 3 months months 1-5 years 5 years Total Borrowings 12,750 52,650 1,156,200 1,221,600 Trade payables 37,934 3,529 41,463 Other current liabilities 17,554 17,554 Due to Government of Kazakhstan 258 773 4,124 10,567 15,722 55,488 13,008 56,952 1,160,324 10,567 1,296,339 Credit risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Group to credit risk, consist primarily of derivative financial instruments, accounts receivable and cash in banks.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The Group considers that its maximum exposure is reflected by the amount of trade accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
The Group places its tenge denominated cash with SB Sberbank JSC, which has a credit rating of Ba3 negative from Moody's rating agency and ING with a credit rating of A1 stable from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2016.
The Group does not guarantee obligations of other parties.
The Group sells its products and makes advance payments only to recognised, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts and recoverability of prepayments made is not significant and thus risk of credit default is low.
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Groups established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.
Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
The Group does not hold collateral as security.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities represents the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Fair value of the quoted notes is based on price quotations at the reporting date and respectively categorised as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is categorised as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and is calculated using Black-Scholes valuation model based on Brent Crude Futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange, with the relative expiration dates ranging from the current reporting date until December 2017.
The following table shows ranges of the inputs depending on maturity, which are used in the model for calculation of the fair value of the derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Future price at the reporting date US$ 56.8258.84 37.19-48.75 Expected volatility % 27.33 30 Risk-free interest rate % 0.84 0.32-0.69 Maturity months 111 1-23 The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 173 Annual report 2016 174 | Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements Capital management For the purpose of the Groups capital management, capital includes issued capital, additional paid-in capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.
In order to achieve this overall objective, the Groups capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the notes that define capital structure requirements.
Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the lenders to immediately call borrowings.
There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of the notes in the current period nor the prior period.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or increase share capital.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt.
The Groups policy is to keep the gearing ratio between 20% and 40%.
The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash, short-term deposits and long-term deposits.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof, adopted by the Company The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the following amendments to IFRS effective as at 1 January 2016: Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 180 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 181 Parent company financial statements Notes to the Parent company financial statements Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting.
The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained.
In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate controlling party.
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively.
These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Company.
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements The amendments allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements.
Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively.
These amendments do not have any impact on the Companys financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Foreign currency translation The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.
The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar the US dollar or US $.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 181 Annual report 2016 182 | Parent company financial statements Notes to the Parent company financial statements Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through the statement of comprehensive income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace regular way trades are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Companys financial assets include investments, loans, cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
Subsequent measurement Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less impairment.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables Accounts receivable are recognized and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for uncollectible amounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
These estimates are reviewed periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported as expense credit in the period in which they become known.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks.
Derecognition A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognized when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 182 Annual report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 183 Parent company financial statements Notes to the Parent company financial statements The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Companys financial liabilities include payables and accrued liabilities.
Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Gains and losses are recognized in the profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fee or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortization is included in finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions, without any deduction for transaction costs.
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques.
Such techniques may include using recent arms length market transactions: reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same: discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
The Companys management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
Foreign currency risk Most of the Companys operation is denominated in USD, therefore the Companys statement of financial position is not significantly affected by exchange rate movements.
Credit risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, consist primarily of receivables and cash in banks.

The Company places its US Dollar and Euro denominated cash with ING with a credit rating of A1 upper medium grade from Moody's rating agency at 31 December 2016.
Receivables are amounts receivable from group companies, thus risk of credit default is low.
