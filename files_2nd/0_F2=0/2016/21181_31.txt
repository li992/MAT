STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Key accounting policies Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group.
The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 109 to 116. a Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2016.
TheGroups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Groups underlying performance.
The face of the Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards.
Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 13, is calculated having adjusted profit after tax for the same items and their tax effect.
The term adjusted profit is not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc are included on pages 103 to 107.
From 1 April 2015, the EDS and ES lines of business were merged and the Executive team now monitor and appraise the business based on the performance of three geographic regions: Asia Pacific: Americas: and Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA.
These three regions are now the basis of the Groups primary operating segments reported in the financial statements.
Performance is evaluated based on regional contribution using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Groups financial statements.
There is no inter-segment revenue.
Balance sheet information is not included in the information provided to the Executive team.
Support functions such as head office departments are controlled and monitored centrally.
Disclosure for the year ended 31 March 2015 has been restated to reflect the new organisational structure.
Also from 1 April 2015, the allocation of costs between selling and distribution expenses and administrative expenses has been amended and the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2015 has been restated accordingly.
Previously, all costs related to the sales offices were included in selling and distribution expenses including the local finance, HR and IT costs to reflect the total cost of the regional sales operation.
In line with industry practice, the presentation has been updated to allocate the costs by function to selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses respectively.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly resulting in an increase of 7.5million to administrative expenses and a corresponding decrease to selling and distribution costs in the year ended 31 March 2015.
There has been no impact on profit from operations.
Similarly, and also in line with industry practice, selling and distribution expenses and administrative expenses have been combined on the face of the Consolidated income statement with the split of these expenses now provided in a note see note 5.
The Directors believe that the revised income statement presentation more appropriately and consistently reflects the nature of the Groups operations.
b Revenue The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises initial licence fees, annual licence fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until: a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced: delivery has been made in accordance with that contract: if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met: and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is deferred until payment is due.
Initial annual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use, and customer support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements, and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract, which is typically 12 months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
79 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements CONTINUED 2 Key accounting policies continued Rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-cancellable and consist of two separate components: the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised up front, provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model, a basket of tokens representing licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
Services Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training, and are performed under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
c Exceptional items The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
d Significant accounting estimates Revenue recognition The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use, and to customer support and maintenance, is reviewed periodically.
On average, the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17%.
Provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2016 was 5,879,000 2015 5,636,000.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates, timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 15.
80 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Key accounting policies continued Income taxes The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and there are instances where significant judgement is required in determining the provision for tax.
The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due.
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made.
Areas of tax judgement and where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain include transfer pricing and deferred tax asset recognition.
Retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied, together with sensitivity analysis, are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2016 was 5,162,000 2015 14,187,000. e Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cash-generating units.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative expenses line item.

At the balance sheet date, the UK government had substantively enacted a 1% reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and by another 1% to 18% from 1 April 2020.
These rate changes resulted in a 85,000 movement to opening deferred tax consisting of a credit of 141,000 to the income statement and a 226,000 charge to comprehensive income.
On 16 March 2016, the UK government announced that it would reduce the main rate of corporation tax by a further 1% from 1 April 2020 to 17%.
This change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is consequently not included in these financial statements.
The effect of this proposed reduction would be immaterial to the UK net deferred tax liability.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 27.

The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has been adjusted for the tax effects of the items adjusted.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is a more representative presentation of the underlying performance of the business.

Goodwill represents the assembled workforce and the future synergy benefits of integrating the business into the AVEVA Group.
Since the date of acquisition the FabTrol business contributed revenue of 1,946,000 and adjusted profit before tax of 396,000.
Acquisition costs including due diligence and professional fees and integration costs of 219,000 have been included in the Consolidated income statement.

Details of the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired and goodwill was set out in detail in the 2015 Annual Report.
The final fair values of the assets acquired were increased by 189,000 from the disclosed provisional values as a result of the collection of a customer debt previously provided against.
Additionally, in January 2016 the Group successfully obtained a partial refund of acquisition consideration paid of an amount of 4,071,000.
This adjustment to the cost of the acquisition and the resulting goodwill was due to the Group claiming under an indemnity provided by the vendors of the business at the time of the acquisition in January 2015.

As a result of the Groups decision to move to a regional organisation structure, goodwill has been reallocated to the three reported segments of Asia Pacific, EMEA and Americas.
This reallocation has been completed on a relative recoverable amount basis.
The goodwill attached to each of the Groups CGUs is as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Engineering & Design Systems 26,535 Enterprise Solutions 24,054 Asia Pacific 19,446 EMEA 24,305 Americas 7,946 51,697 50,589 87 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements CONTINUED 15 Goodwill continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
In2015 16 the goodwill impairment testing was carried out on a value in use VIU basis using the most recently approved management budgets for the year ended 31 March 2017 together with the most recent three-year business plan extrapolated out for a duration of five years in total.
Projected cash flows beyond five years have been assumed at the long-term growth rate for that region and these have been used to formulate a terminal value for the discounted cash flow calculation.
Cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates of 12%, 9% and 11% per annum, reflecting the weighted average cost of capital for each of the Asia Pacific, EMEA and Americas CGUs respectively.
Asia Pacific During the year the contribution of the Asia Pacific segment was 43.9million 2015 40.6million.
This is far in excess of the attributable goodwill and any other intangible assets.
Therefore, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
EMEA During the year the contribution of the EMEA segment was 58.8million 2015 61.8million.
Americas During the year the contribution of the Americas segment was 8.3 million 2015 19.3 million.
A VIU assessment was prepared for this CGU which was based on budget and business planning data for the next three years and which assumed revenues returning to levels recorded in 2015.
The VIU assessment demonstrated considerable headroom and the sensitivity analysis performed showed that projected revenue for the Americas region at the end of the period covered by the business plan would need to be 20% lower than projected before a possible impairment would be indicated.
The purchased brand represents that acquired as part of the 8over8 acquisition in 2014 15 and is being amortised over five years.
For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation note 13, intangible asset amortisation excludes the charge relating to other software of 338,000 2015 628,000.

23 Obligations under leases As at 31 March 2016 the Group had the following future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: 2016 2015 Land and Plant and Land and Plant and buildings machinery buildings machinery 000 000 000 000 Not later than one year 4,753 515 4,951 291 After one but not more than five years 6,426 409 8,050 353 More than five years 261 11,179 924 13,262 644 The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, motor vehicles and items of equipment.
These leases have a duration of between one and five years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
24 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 633,000 2015 765,000 and profit after tax by 506,000 2015 604,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, South Korean Won, and Japanese Yen, reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies, whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research & Development, are settled in Sterling, Indian Rupees and Swedish Krona.
92 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 Financial risk management continued The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
In addition, it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively.
At 31 March 2016, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $18million 2015 $22.8million and 10.4million 2015 9.7million.
It also had outstanding currency exchange contracts to buy Danish kr0million 2015 kr4.5million.
Non-deliverable forward contracts were used to hedge the purchase of INR0million 2015 INR30million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling, and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2014 15.
Increase decrease in average Profit loss Equity 31 March 2016 rate 000 000 US Dollar 10% 1,450 1,450 10% 1,594 1,594 Euro 10% 267 267 10% 294 294 Increase decrease in average Profit loss Equity 31 March 2015 rate 000 000 US Dollar 10% 2,190 2,190 10% 2,450 2,450 Euro 10% 70 70 10% 77 77 b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
As set out in the Groups treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum of 50% of the Groups total counterparty risk.
Within this overall limit, some counterparties are subject to more restrictive caps on counterparty exposure.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit quality of trade receivables are included in note 19.
93 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements CONTINUED 24 Financial risk management continued c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows: Between Less than three Between six three months and months and Greater than months six months one year one year 000 000 000 000 As at 31 March 2016 Trade and other payables 35,966 As at 31 March 2015 Trade and other payables 32,983 The table below analyses the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts, which will be settled on a gross basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Groups financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2016, the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 864,000 at 31 March 2016 2015 432,000 liability.
The resulting loss of 432,000 2015 loss of 980,000 on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
e Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2015 or 2016.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.
25 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and the movements thereon during the current and previous year: Decelerated Retirement capital Land and benefit Intangible Share allowances buildings obligations assets options Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 April 2014 58 130 1,171 2,471 744 2,756 2,128 Acquisition 2,428 644 1,328 456 Credit charge to income statement 176 64 1,065 107 718 Credit charge to other comprehensive income 1,085 380 1,465 Charged to equity 126 126 Exchange adjustment 25 52 27 At 31 March 2015 209 130 2,256 4,455 197 4,243 2,320 Acquisition 798 28 770 Credit charge to income statement 37 21 21 1,063 26 1,016 26 Credit charge to other comprehensive income 1,868 1,868 Credited to equity 2 2 Exchange adjustment 4 214 70 280 At 31 March 2016 176 109 409 4,404 173 3,185 570 A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2016 2015 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 3,187 1,480 Deferred tax assets 2,617 3,800 570 2,320 95 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements CONTINUED 25 Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 7,005,000 2015 1,654,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 1,514,000 2015 533,000, 933,000 2015 40,000 has been recognised and is included in other above.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 37,134,000 2015 37,003,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
26 Retirement benefit obligations The movement on the provision for retirement benefit obligations was as follows: German South UK defined defined Korean benefit benefit severance scheme schemes pay Total 000 000 000 000 At 31 March 2014 5,853 1,074 1,921 8,848 Current service cost 1,487 246 1,733 Net interest on pension scheme liabilities 276 42 65 383 Actuarial remeasurements 11,389 122 15 11,496 Employer contributions 7,724 47 526 8,297 Exchange adjustment 132 156 24 At 31 March 2015 11,281 1,059 1,847 14,187 Current service cost 213 213 Net interest on pension scheme liabilities 506 30 42 578 Actuarial remeasurements 7,936 211 112 7,837 Employer contributions 1,580 11 471 2,062 Exchange adjustment 104 21 83 At 31 March 2016 2,271 1,393 1,498 5,162 a UK defined benefit scheme The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded.
This scheme was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002 with the option of reopening if required and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 2004.
The scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 1 April 2015.
Pensions are also payable to dependants on death.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally qualified actuary, Broadstone Corporate Benefits Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows: 2016 2015 % % Main assumptions: Discount rate 3.40 3.10 Inflation assumption RPI 3.30 3.30 Rate of salary increases 5.30 5.30 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.10 3.10 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.30 2.30 Cash Commutation 20% of pension 20% of pension The duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 19 years.
For the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, the mortality assumptions adopted imply the following weighted average life expectancies at age 65: 2016 2015 Years Years Male pensioners 23.1 23.8 Female pensioners 24.3 25.0 Non-retired males 24.2 25.1 Non-retired females 25.6 26.5 Company contributions were 1,580,000 2015 7,724,000.
The total contributions in 2016 17 are expected to be approximately 1,580,000.
The PPF levy of approximately 20,000 will be payable in addition 2015 19,300.
96 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26 Retirement benefit obligations continued The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.

Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH has been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad employees.
At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.
In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which results in the insurance company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
