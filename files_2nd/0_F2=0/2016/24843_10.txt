The chart represents a target only and is not a profit forecast.
There can be no assurance that this target will be met.
Portfolio valuation assumes a Euro to Sterling exchange rate of 0.79, a Canadian Dollar to Sterling Exchange rate of 0.54, an Australian Dollar to Sterling Exchange rate of 0.53 and a weighted average discount rate of 7.5% per annum.
These assumptions and the valuation of the current portfolio may vary over time.
The cash flows and the valuation are from the portfolio of 104 investments as at 31 March 2016 and does not include other assets or liabilities of the Group, and assumes that during the period illustrated above, i no new investments are purchased, ii no existing investments are sold and iii the Group suffers no material liability to withholding taxes, or taxation on income or gains.
The chart shows the steady long-term nature of the cash flows from the portfolio, coupled with a stable portfolio valuation to 2031.
The benefit of the new investments made in the year, increasing forecast cash flows and the valuation over time is also shown.
From 2032, based on current forecasts, the portfolio will move into a repayment phase when cash receipts from the portfolio will be paid to the Companys shareholders as capital and the portfolio valuation reduces as projects reach the end of their concession term, assuming that the proceeds are not invested in new investments, until 2051 when the last concession ends.
It is these forecast cash flows from the Groups current portfolio of investments that give the Board the comfort that there should be sufficient cash cover for the revised target dividend of 7.65p per share for the year to 31 March 2017 and the new dividend guidance of 7.85p per share for the year to 31 March 2018.
Directors Valuation at 31 March 2016 The Directors Valuation of the portfolio at 31 March 2016 was 2,030.3m.
This valuation compares to 1,732.2m at 31 March 2015 up 17.2%.
A reconciliation between the Directors valuation at 31 March 2016 and that shown in the financial statements is given in Note 12 to the financial statements, the principal difference being that the Directors Valuation includes the 97.4m outstanding equity commitments in respect of the A63 Motorway, Centrale Supelec, N17 N18 Gort to Tuam Road, PSBP North East, RD 901 Road, Willesden Hospital, Zaanstad Penitentiary and the Northern European Fire, Law & Order project.

The growth in the valuation of the portfolio at 31 March 2016 over the rebased value was 11.2%.
The increase arises from a 138.0m return from the portfolio, a 60.2m uplift from a 0.4% decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to value the portfolio as well as a 4.2m net negative valuation movement from changes to certain economic assumptions -18.7m and foreign exchange rates 14.5m.
The negative movement in economic assumptions included lower forecast deposit rates and European inflation figures, combined with more prudent tax assumptions in light of anticipated changes to tax legislation offset by lower UK tax rates.

qxp XXXX 25 05 2016 11:16 Page 29 Return from the Portfolio The return from the portfolio of 138.0m 2015: 142.6m represents a 7.9% 2015: 9.6% increase in the rebased value of the portfolio.
As expected, the majority of this return 7.7%, being the average was generated by the unwinding of the weighted average discount rate used to value the portfolio in the year.
Incremental value was generated from operational outperformance, including savings from portfolio insurance, though this was negated by the adverse impact of actual UK inflation running lower than the 2.75% p. a. forecast assumption.
Discount rates The main method for determining the appropriate discount rate used for valuing each investment is based on the Investment Advisers knowledge of the market, taking into account intelligence gained from bidding activities, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of these markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.
When there are limited transactions or information available, and as a second method and sense check, a bottom up approach is taken based on the appropriate long-term Government Bond yield and an appropriate risk premium.
The risk premium takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings e. g. predictability and covenant of the concession income, all of which may be differentiated by project phase and market participants appetite for these risks.
In the current portfolio there are only five projects in construction at 31 March 2016.
An investment in a project under construction can offer a higher overall return i. e. require a higher discount rate compared to buying an investment in an operational project, but it does not usually yield during the construction period and there is the risk that delays in construction affect the investment value.
The discount rates used for investments under construction are higher than the prior year as Allenby & Connaught MoD Accommodation project, a late stage construction project in March 2015, completed construction in the year.
An analysis of the weighted average discount rates for the investments in the portfolio analysed by territory, and showing movement in the year, is shown below: 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 Movement Discount rate Country Long-term government Risk premium Discount rate bond yield UK 2.2% 5.3% 7.5% 7.8% 0.3% Australia & NZ 2.6% 5.3% 7.9% 8.2% 0.3% 1 Eurozone 1.0% 6.8% 7.8% 8.2% 0.4% North America 2.0% 5.1% 7.1% 7.4% 0.3% Portfolio 2.1% 5.4% 7.5% 7.9% 0.4% 1.
The long-term government bond yield for the Eurozone is the weighted average for all of the countries in which the portfolio is invested namely France, theNetherlands and Ireland.
In the UK, there is sufficient market data on discount rates and hence the risk premium is derived from this market discount rate for operational social and transportation infrastructure investments less the appropriate long-term Government Bond yield.
For Australia, Canada and the Eurozone, where there is less market data, more emphasis is placed on the bottom up approach to determine discount rates.
The Board discusses the proposed valuation with the third-party valuation expert to ensure that the valuation of the Groups portfolio is appropriate.
As long-term Government Bond yields in the UK, Australia, Canada and the Eurozone are currently low, this has resulted in higher country risk premiums as discount rates have not fallen as far as bond yields.
The Investment Advisers view is that discount rates used to value projects dont follow bond yields, although naturally there is some correlation over the longer term.
The implication from this is that an increase from these historically low bond yields could happen without necessarily adversely impacting discount rates.
The 0.4% reduction in the weighted average discount rate in the year is attributable to a more competitive environment for infrastructure assets.
While there is a slow supply of new investment opportunities, new market entrants, attracted by the favourable risk-adjusted returns, have driven prices upwards, and hence caused discount rates to fall further during the year.
This is a trend the Investment Adviser is still experiencing currently based on recent market transactions.

qxp XXXX 25 05 2016 11:16 Page 30 Section 2: Strategic Report continued Valuation Assumptions Apart from the discount rates, the other key economic assumptions used in determining the Directors valuation of the portfolio are as follows: 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 1 UK RPI and RPIx 2.75% p. a.

Retail Price Index and Retail Price Index excluding mortgage interest payments Valuation Sensitivities The portfolios valuation is sensitive to each of the macro-economic assumptions listed above.
An explanation of the reason for the sensitivity and an analysis of how each variable in isolation i. e. while keeping the other assumptions constant impacts the valuation follows below.
The sensitivities are also contained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Discount Rate Sensitivity Whilst not a macro-economic assumption, the weighted average discount rate that is applied to each projects forecast cash flows, for the purposes of valuing the portfolio, is arguably the single most important variable.
The impact of a 0.5% change in the discount rate on the Directors valuation and the NAV per share is shown below: Discount rate -0.5% change Base Case 7.5% 0.5% change Directors valuation 101.5m 2,030.3m -93.7m 1 NAV per share 7.3p share 142.2p share -6.7p share 1.
NAV per share based on 1,388m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2016 Inflation Rate Sensitivity The projects in the portfolio have contractual income streams derived from public sector clients, which are rebased every year for inflation.
UK projects tend to use either RPI Retail Price Index or RPIx RPI excluding mortgage payments, and revenues are either partially or totally indexed depending on the contract and the nature of the projects financing.
Facilities management sub-contracts have similar indexation arrangements.

qxp XXXX 25 05 2016 11:16 Page 31 In the UK RPI and RPIx were 1.6% for the year ended 31 March 2016.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK inflation of 2.75% per annum for both RPI and RPIx, the same assumption as for the prior year.
The March 2016 forecasts for RPI out to December 2017 range from 2.2% to 3.6% from 17 independent forecasters as compiled by HM Treasury, with an average forecast of 3.0%.
The impact of a 0.5% movement in the inflation rate on the Directors valuation and the NAV per share is shown below: 1 1 Inflation rate UK -0.5% p. a. change Base Case 2.75% p. a.
Analysis based on the 20 largest investments, extrapolated for the whole portfolio 2.
NAV per share based on 1,388m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2016 Deposit Rate Sensitivity Each projects interest costs are at fixed rates, either through fixed rate bonds or bank debt which is hedged with an interest rate swap, or linked to inflation through index-linked bonds.
A projects sensitivity to interest rates relates to the cash deposits which the project is required to maintain as part of its senior debt funding.
For example most projects would have a debt service reserve account in which six months of debt service payments are held.
As at 31 March 2016, cash deposits for the portfolio were earning interest at a rate of 0.4% per annum on average.
There is a consensus that UK base rates will remain low for an extended period, with a current median forecast for UK base rates in December 2017 of 1.3% p. a.
The portfolio valuation assumes UK deposit interest rates are 1.0% p. a. to March 2020 and 2.5% p. a. thereafter.
Once again this extends the period of 1.0% deposit interest rates and applies a lower long-term rate compared to that applied in the March 2015 valuation, which assumed 1.0% deposit interest rates to March 2019 and 3.0% thereafter.
These changes have reduced the portfolio valuation and are included within the 18.7m aggregate decrease in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic Assumptions.
The impact of a 0.5% change in the deposit rate on the Directors valuation and the NAV per share is shown below: Base 1.00% p. a. then 1 1 Deposit rate -0.5% p. a. change 0.5% p. a. change 2.50% p. a.

NAV per share based on 1,388m Ordinary Shares as at 31 March 2016 Lifecycle Expenditure Sensitivity Lifecycle also called asset renewal or major maintenance concerns the replacement of material parts of the asset to maintain it over the concession life.
It involves larger items that are not covered by routine maintenance and for a building will include items like the replacement of boilers, chillers, carpets and doors when they reach the end of their useful economic lives.
The lifecycle obligation, together with the budget and the risk, is usually either taken by the project company and hence the investor or is subcontracted and taken by the FM contractor.
Of the 20 largest investments, 12 have lifecycle as a project company risk i. e. not subcontracted to the supply-chain.
This is broadly typical of the portfolio as a whole.
The impact of a 10% change to the projected budget for lifecycle, where the risk is taken by the project company, on the Directors valuation and the NAV per share is shown below: 1 1 Lifecycle expenditure -10% p. a. change Base 10% p. a. change Directors valuation 48.7m 2,030.3m -52.8m 2 NAV per share 3.5p share 142.2p share -3.8p share 1.
Analysis based on the 12 investments within the 20 largest investments where the project company retains the lifecycle obligation, extrapolated for the whole portfolio assuming that the sensitivity analysis on those 12 of the top 20 is representative of the entire portfolio.
