Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date.
There has been no change in the valuation technique in the year.
The total fees earned by CBRE and Savills from the Company represent less than 5% of their total UK revenues.

There have been no transfers of properties between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended 31 March 2016.
The fair value at 31 March 2016 represents the highest and best use.
i Technique The valuation techniques described below are consistent with IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs.
There have been no changes in valuation techniques since the prior year.
Yield capitalisation for commercial investment properties, market rental values are capitalised with a market capitalisation rate.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the net initial yields and the fair market values per square foot derived from recent market transactions.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements LondonMetric Property Plc 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2016 continued 9 Investment properties continued Residual for certain investment properties under development, the fair value of the property is calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the yield capitalisation technique less estimated costs to completion and a risk premium.
Comparison for residential properties the fair value is calculated by using data from recent market transactions.
ii Sensitivity An increase or decrease in ERV will increase or decrease the fair value of the Groups investment properties.
An increase or decrease to the net initial yields and reversionary yields will decrease or increase the fair value of the Groups investment properties.
An increase or decrease in the estimated costs of development will decrease or increase the fair value of the Groups investment properties under development.
There are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs as they are determined by market conditions: an increase inmore than one input could magnify or mitigate the impact on the valuation.
iii Process The valuation reports produced by CBRE and Savills are based on: Information provided by the Group, such as current rents, lease terms, capital expenditure and comparable sales information, which is derived from the Groups financial and property management systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment Assumptions applied by the valuers such as ERVs and yields which are based on market observation and their professional judgement CBRE and Savills meet the Auditors and the Audit Committee semi-annually.

b Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Groups financial risk management objectives are to minimise the effect of risks it is exposed to through its operations and the use of debt nancing.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements LondonMetric Property Plc 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2016 continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued The principal financial risks to the Group and the policies it has in place to manage these risks are summarised below: i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash deposits and trade receivables.
The Group mitigates financial loss from tenant defaults by dealing with only creditworthy tenants.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and therefore the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Cash is placed on deposit with a diverse mix of institutions with suitable credit ratings and rates of return and for varying periods of time.
The credit ratings of the banks are monitored and changes are made where necessary to manage risk.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties.
ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments onits debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and committed investments.
The Groups funding sources are diversied across a range of banks.
Weekly cash ow forecasts are prepared for the Executive Committee to ensure sufficient resources of cash and undrawn borrowing facilities are in place to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The Group had cash reserves of 42.6 million 2015: 50.6 million and available and undrawn bank loan facilities at 31 March 2016 of 64.9 million 2015: 72.2 million.
The following table shows the contractual maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities on an undiscounted cash ow basis and assuming settlement on the earliest repayment date.
Less than One to Two to More than one year two years five years five years Total As at 31 March 2016 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 14,358 14,358 43,112 578,087 649,915 Derivative financial instruments 5,750 6,279 18,389 5,767 36,185 20,108 20,637 61,501 583,854 686,100 Less than One to Two to More than one year two years five years five years Total As at 31 March 2015 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 13,043 100,833 202,319 204,195 520,390 Derivative financial instruments 3,506 3,619 6,958 2,260 16,343 16,549 104,452 209,277 206,455 536,733 Strategic report Governance Financial statements LondonMetric Property Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 125 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2016 continued 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued iii Market risk interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the use of debt nancing at a variable rate.
It is the risk that future cash ows ofa financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in interest rates.
It is Group policy that a reasonable portion of external borrowings are at a xed interest rate in order to manage this risk.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its interest rate exposure and hedge future interest rate risk for the term of the bank loan.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully the cash ow risk associated with interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
At 31 March 2016 the Group excluding share of joint ventures had 524.6 million 2015: 364.6 million of hedges in place, and its debt of 575.0 million 2015: 465.5 million was 91.2% 2015: 78% hedged by way of interest rate swaps and caps.
Consequently, based on year end debt levels, a 1% change in interest rates would decrease or increase the Groups annual profit before tax by 2.5 million and 1.5 million respectively.
Including its share of joint ventures the Group had 593.1 million 2015: 450.5 million of hedges in place and its debt of 637.9 million 2015: 563.0 million was 93.0% 2015: 80% xed.
The average interest rate payable by the Group including share of joint ventures on all bank borrowings at 31 March 2016 including the cost of amortising finance arrangement fees was 3.5% 2015: 3.7%.
iv Capital risk management The Groups objectives when maintaining capital are to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can provide returns to shareholders and as such it seeks to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes long term borrowings and undrawn debt facilities, and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

The market values of hedging products change with interest rate uctuations, but the exposure of the Group to movements ininterest rates is protected by way of the hedging products listed above.
In accordance with accounting standards, fair value is estimated by calculating the presentvalue of future cash ows, using appropriate market discount rates.
For all derivative financial instruments this equates to a Level 2 fair value measurement as dened by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
The valuation therefore does not reect the cost or gain to the Group of cancelling its interest rate protection at the balance sheet date, which is generally a marginally higher cost or smaller gain than a market valuation.
