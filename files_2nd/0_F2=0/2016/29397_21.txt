80 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year-ended 31 March 2016 1 GENERAL INFORMATION Reporting entity Sophos Group plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Companys registered office is Sophos Group plc, The Pentagon, Abingdon Science Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, OX14 3YP, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year-ended 31 March 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Group is a leading provider of cloud enabled enduser and network security solutions.
Prior to the Initial Public Offering of the Companys shares, Shield Midco Limited was the largest Company for which consolidated financial statements were produced.
Statutory accounts for that company for the year-ended 31 March 2015 were approved by the Board of Directors on 1 June 2015 and were delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.
2 APPLICATION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRSs The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective.
The Directors are still evaluating the impact on the Group of IFRS 16 Leases, which was issued in January 2016 and becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2019.
The Directors do not anticipate that the following IFRSs will have a significant effect on the Groups consolidated financial information: Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2016: Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 38 Intangible Assets Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2017: Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Amendment to IAS12 Income Taxes Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 2018: IFRS 9 2014 Financial Instruments Based on the latest available guidance, the Directors have made an initial assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have concluded that there may be a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial information as a result of the deferral of commissions and rebates in line with the recognition of revenue, and the accelerated recognition of certain software revenue where the Group has no remaining vendor obligations.
The provisional estimate of this impact on results, had it been effective for the reported periods, is summarised as follows: 2016 2015 $M $M Increase in revenue 3.4 5.0 Decrease increase in expenses 0.2 3.4 Increase in operating profit 3.6 8.4 Increase decrease in cash EBITDA 0.2 3.4 Increase in other receivables 20.5 20.8 Decrease in deferred revenue 25.2 21.3 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs as they apply to the Group.
3.2 Going Concern The Group has considerable financial resources together with contracts with a large number of customers and across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 37.
Further information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report and the notes to the financial statements.
In addition, note 27 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
3.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated historical financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention and is presented in US Dollars.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million $M unless otherwise indicated.
The functional currency of Sophos Group plc is US Dollars.
The Group uses US Dollars as its presentation currency to aid comparability of its financial information with that of its peers: whose information is generally presented in US Dollars.
The accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated historical financial information for the year-ended 31 March 2016 have been consistently applied to all years presented and are set out below.
The historical financial information consolidates the financial information of Sophos Group plc and the entities it controls its subsidiaries at 31 March 2016.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions that are recognised in the statement of financial position of the individual reporting entities, are eliminated in full on consolidation.
3.4 Foreign currency translation The individual historical financial information of each Group company is prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the historical financial information of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
In preparing the financial information of the individual companies, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
All exchange differences are taken to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency US Dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated into US Dollars at the prior month closing rate to that in which the transaction took place because they approximate the rate of exchange at the transaction dates.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of entities whose functional currency is not US Dollars, together with differences arising from the translation of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are taken to equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred accumulated amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
82 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2016 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3.5 Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of historical financial information requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the period.
The nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described in this note, management has made the following judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Revenue The Group sells software products under fixed term contracts and perpetual licences.
Where there is a multi-element arrangement, the consideration receivable is allocated to each element of the arrangement and this is done on the basis of an estimate of their respective fair values.
In determining the relative fair values of each element, management make reference to current prices of individual elements and adjust this by its relative share of discounts applied to the entire sale.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.
Further details are contained in note 18.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles The Group determines whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired on at least an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill and intangible assets are allocated.
Estimating a value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Share-based payments transactions The fair value of employee share options and share warrants issued to third parties are measured using the Black-Scholes model.
Measurement inputs include share price on the measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.
The fair value of Restricted share units and Performance share units is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the day of the grant.
Research and development costs Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in this note.
Determining the amounts to be capitalised requires management to make assumptions regarding the capitalisation criteria requirements of IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Business combinations Management is required to make an assessment of the intangible assets to be recognised as a result of the business acquisition.
Furthermore, management is required to make an assessment as to whether the intangible assets are separable and their fair values as at the time of acquisition.
This is based on certain assumptions including the expected future cash flows arising from use of the intangibles, discount rates and estimated economic lives of the intangibles.
Provisions The Group measures provisions at managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, discounted where the time value of money is considered material.
These estimates take account of available information, historical experience and the likelihood of different possible outcomes.
Both the amount and the maturity of these liabilities could be different from those estimated.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 83 3.6 Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Revenue from software licenses and service contracts The Group sells software products under fixed term contracts and perpetual licenses.
Where there is multi-element arrangement revenue is allocated to each element on a fair value basis, based on the price at which the respective elements are usually sold separately, regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract.
The portion of the revenue allocated to an element is recognised when the revenue recognition criteria for that element has been met.
Fixed term contracts Customers who receive software products at the start of the contract under a fixed term license, and are entitled to receive regular updates and upgrades for the duration of the license term which runs for periods ranging from 1 to 5 years.
Revenue for these fixed rate contracts is recognised rateably over the period that the contractual obligation exists.
Accrued and deferred revenue arising on long-term contracts is included in receivables as accrued income and payables as deferred revenue as appropriate.
Where the Group contracts with an original equipment manufacturer OEM or a service provider, rather than an end user, it mirrors the above policy and recognises the revenue in line with the contractual terms granted to the end user.
Perpetual licenses Revenue is recognised immediately where customers purchase software products under a perpetual license.
Revenue in respect of support and maintenance contracts associated with perpetual licenses is recognised rateably over the life of the support maintenance contract.
Sale of goods Where software licenses and hardware and are sold together, if the software is not essential to the functionality of the tangible product, then the revenue from the sale of goods is recognised immediately.
However, where the software is essential to the functionality of the tangible product and the hardware cannot function without the software, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised rateably over the period of the associated software license contract.
Interest income Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
3.7 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Except for freehold land, depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual values of all property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Over the lease period Computer equipment 3 years Other plant and equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures and fittings 6 10 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset is included in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period of fide-recognition.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end.
84 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2016 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3.8 Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
This involves recognising identifiable assets including previously unrecognised intangible assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities and excluding future restructuring of the acquired business at fair value.
Business combinations on or after 1 April 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as goodwill and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 31 March 2004 is recorded at its previous carrying amount under UK GAAP and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Goodwill assets considered significant in comparison to the Companys total carrying amount of such assets have been allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it.
3.9 Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets is taken to the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred to the extent that the expenditure does not qualify for capitalisation under research and development costs.
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is classified as an intangible asset.
The capitalised costs of software for internal use include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and incremental payroll and payroll-related costs arising from the assignment of employees to implementation projects.
Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended internal use.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised over their expected useful lives as follows: Intangible assets arising on acquisition of subsidiaries Intellectual property relating to Unified Threat Management technology 65% reducing balance basis Other intellectual property 35% reducing balance basis Brand names 35% reducing balance basis Customer base 45% 49% reducing balance basis Other purchased intangible assets All other intangibles 3 years straight-line basis The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a general finance and administration cost.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least annually.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.
Such intangibles are not amortised.
The term of their useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be appropriate.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 85 3.10 Research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured and technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use.
It is amortised over the period of expected future sales.
Development expenditure incurred on minor or major upgrades, or other changes in software functionalities does not satisfy the criteria, as the product is not substantially new in its design or functional characteristics.
Such expenditure is therefore recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss as incurred.
3.11 Impairment of assets At least annually, or when otherwise required, management reviews the carrying amounts of the Groups tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money as well as risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not beyond the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as income in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss, although impairment losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
3.12 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
The cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for resale is based on the purchase cost and is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
3.13 Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
When financial instruments are recognised initially they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Trade receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount, including value added tax and other sales taxes, less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of any outstanding amounts at the period end and on historical performance.
Provision for bad debts is made in the period in which they are identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits repayable in 90 days or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand and bank deposits net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at cost, which is deemed to be materially the same as the fair value.
86 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2016 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Classification of shares as debt or equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
When shares are issued, any component that creates a financial liability of the Group is presented as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position: measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
The corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are charged as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the re-purchase, settlement or other cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements and interest rate caps to reduce its exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the reporting date.
Changes in the fair values are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying value of the hedged item is either not adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from the hedged risk or is so adjusted but that adjustment is not recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.
Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 Financial Instruments are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility.
3.14 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
3.15 Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
3.16 Taxation Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other financial years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 87 Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the historical financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
As explained under Share-based payments below, a remuneration expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period from the award date to the vesting date of the relevant options.
Where there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset may be recorded.
Any deferred tax asset arising on share option awards is calculated as the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Groups share price at the reporting date pro-rated to the extent that the services of the employee have been rendered over the vesting period.
If this amount exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Similarly, current tax relief in excess of the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate is also recorded in retained earnings.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised in jurisdictions in which future tax deductions are expected.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority.
3.17 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in the period in which they become payable.
3.18 Share-based payments Employees including senior executives of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 30.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
At each reporting date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss.

Such items are included within the income statement caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of the consolidated income statement.
3.20 Events after reporting date Events between the reporting date and the date the financial statements are approved, favourable and unfavourable, providing evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date, adjust the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Those that indicate conditions arising after the reporting date are disclosed but are not recognised within the financial statements.
4 SEGMENT INFORMATION For internal management reporting purposes, the primary segment reporting format is determined to be geographic segments as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by the different economic environments.
This is consistent with the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has only one secondary business segment on the basis that the products and services offered to external customers are very similar and therefore do not result in different risks and rates of return for the Group.
The Groups geographical segments are based on the location of the Groups operations consisting of Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA, The Americas and Asia Pacific and Japan APJ.
Billings are the value of products and services invoiced to customers after receiving a purchase order from the customer and delivering products and services to them, or for which there is no right to a refund for undelivered items.
Billings does not equate to statutory revenue.
Billings are classified by the geographic location of direct customers, OEMs and the distributors which purchase our products.
The geographic location of OEMs or distributors may be different from that of the end customers.
A disclosure of revenue by region is included in the Financial Review on page 27.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in note 3.
Segment profits represent the profit earned by each segment without allocation of central administration costs including Directors salaries, finance costs and income tax expense.
This is the measure reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Chief Executive Officer, and Senior Management Team for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Oversight of taxation is within the remit of the Audit and Risk Committee composed of Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for tax strategy supported by a global team of tax professionals.
There is an ongoing risk, with changes to taxation law or perceptions on tax planning strategies in multiple territories where the Group operates, that could lead to a higher effective tax rate.
Legislative change in key territories is being monitored and acted upon.
Sophos strives for an open and transparent relationship with all revenue authorities.
A tax authority may seek adjustment to the filing position adopted by a Group company and it is accepted that interpretation of complex regulations may lead to additional tax being assessed.
Uncertain tax positions are monitored regularly and the provision made in the accounts was appropriate.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 95 14 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if all dilutive potential ordinary shares were converted into ordinary shares.
In accordance with IAS 33, the dilutive earnings per share are without reference to adjustments in respect of outstanding shares when the impact would be anti-dilutive.
Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the cash EBITDA for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
In each case, the weighted average number of shares take into account the weighted average number of own shares held during the period.

Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
For the year-ended 31 March 2016, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill based on internal value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to billings and direct costs during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors' most recent financial forecasts for the following five years.
The growth rates for the five year period are based on managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations.
Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $54.6M 2015: $23.5M of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $193.9M 2015:$178.1M unutilised as it is not considered probable that there will be the required type of future trading or non-trading profits available in the correct entities necessary to permit offset and recognition.
The Groups tax charge is driven by the profit mix amongst the key jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of losses where current forecasts indicate profits will arise in the foreseeable future against which the losses recognised will be offset.
As at 31 March 2016 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was $Nil 2015: $Nil.
No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.
2 Act 2015 determined that the main rate of corporation tax would reduce from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and reduced from 19% to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020.

At 31 March 2016, the present value of future lease payments was $0.2M 2015: $0.0.
Contingent Consideration As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owners of Reflexion Inc. a contingent consideration has been agreed.
The consideration is dependent on the billings of the Reflexion Inc. product range for the calendar years ended 31 December 2015 and ending 31 December 2016 with a maximum payout of $6.5M.
The fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date was estimated at $2.0M.
The contingent consideration is due for final measurement and payment to the former shareholders on 5 June 2016 in respect of billings for the calendar year ended 31 December 2015, and no later than 31 March 2017 in respect of the billings for the calendar year ending 31 December 2016.

27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk management is conducted at a Group level, applying treasury policies which have been approved by the Board.
The major financial risks to which the Group is exposed relate to interest rate risk, credit risk and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Where appropriate, cost effective and practicable, the Group uses various financial instruments to manage these risks.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to reduce the impact on the Group operations of changes in market rates.
No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other instruments is permitted.
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below: Liquidity risk The Group prepares budgets annually in advance.
This enables the Groups operating cash flow requirements to be anticipated and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs, financial obligations and to invest any surplus cash assets safely and profitably.
Quarterly covenant tests are performed and monitored by the Directors at quarterly board meetings.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding, minimising finance costs and maintaining flexibility through the use of short-term deposits and intra-group loan arrangements.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholders value.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 21, borrowings as disclosed in note 25 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
The Group reviews the capital structure on a regular basis and considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the Directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references.
Credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The expense recognised in the Consolidated Statement of profit or loss in respect of doubtful debts during the period was $0.3M, as disclosed in note 19.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in trade receivables: exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
With respect to cash and deposits, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the risk of default by the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these assets.
To mitigate this risk, cash and deposits are only held with reputable banking institutions.
The Group reduces the concentrations of credit risk in cash and deposits by holding balances with a number of separate institutions.
106 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2016 27 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to the long-term debt obligations with floating rates of interest.
Interest rate sensitivity A change of 100 basis points in market interest rates would have increased decreased equity and profit and loss by the amounts shown below.
Year-ended Year-ended 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 $M $M Increase in interest rates 2.3 1.2 Decrease in interest rates 2.3 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk.
Several other currencies in addition to the reporting currency of US Dollar are used, including Sterling and the Euro.
The Group experiences currency exchange differences arising upon retranslation of monetary items primarily short-term inter-company balances and long-term borrowings, which are recognised as an expense in the period the retranslation occurs.
The Group endeavours to match the cash inflows and outflows in the various currencies: the Group typically invoices its customers in their local currency, and pays its local expenses in local currency as a means to mitigate this risk.
The Group is also exposed to exchange differences arising from the translation of its subsidiaries financial statements into the Groups reporting currency of US Dollar with the corresponding exchange differences taken directly to equity.
The following table illustrates the movement that 10% in the value of Sterling or the Euro would have had on the Groups profit or loss for the period and on the Groups equity as at the end of the period.

108 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year-ended 31 March 2016 30 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Share-based payment expense The expense recognised for employee services received during the year is as follows: Year-ended Year-ended 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 $M $M Cash-settled transactions 1.3 0.1 Equity-settled transactions 15.0 1.4 Total share-based payment expense 16.3 1.5 The cash-settled expense comprises cash-based awards together with certain social security taxes.
The carrying value of the liability as at 31 March 2016 was $1.1M 2015: $0.1M.
Share Options The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table illustrates the weighted average inputs into the Black-Scholes model in the year: Year-ended Year-ended 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 Weighted average share price $ cents 130.63 79.55 Weighted average exercise price $ cents 130.63 75.81 Expected volatility 0.3266 0.5147 Expected life of options years 2.28 0.65 Risk free rate 0.0057 0.0054 Expected dividends Nil Nil The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was $ cents 24.4 2015 $ cents 13.1.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical share price volatility of comparable listed companies over the expected life of the options.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
An increase in the expected volatility will increase the estimated fair value.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, taking into account the effects of exercise restrictions, non-transferability and behavioural considerations.
An increase in the expected life will increase the estimated fair value.
The fair value of awards with a market condition has been discounted to reflect the probability of meeting the market condition attached to the options.
