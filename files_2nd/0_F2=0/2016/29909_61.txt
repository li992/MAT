Subsidiaries The accounting period ends of the subsidiaries consolidated in these financial statements are on or around 27 February 2016.
Consolidated structured entities The Group has a number of securitisation structured entities established in connection with Tesco Banks credit card securitisation transactions.

As such these entities are effectively controlled by the Group, and are therefore accounted for as subsidiaries of the Group.

The accounting period end dates of the joint ventures and associates consolidated in these financial statement range from 31 December 2015 to 27 February 2016.
The accounting period end dates for joint ventures differ from those of the Group for commercial reasons and depend upon the requirements of the joint venture partner as well as those of the Group.
The accounting period end dates of the associates are different from those of the Group as they depend upon the requirements of the parent companies of those entities.
There are no significant restrictions on the ability of joint ventures and associates to transfer funds to the parent, other than those imposed by the Companies Act 2006.
Summarised financial information for joint ventures and associates The summarised financial information for UK Property joint ventures has been aggregated in order to provide useful information to users without excessive detail since these entities have similar characteristics and risk profiles largely based on their nature of activities and geographic market.
The UK property joint ventures involve the Group partnering with third parties in carrying out some property investments in order to enhance returns from property and access funding whilst reducing risks associated with sole ownership.
These property investments generally cover shopping centres and standalone stores.
The Group enters into operating leases for some or all of the properties held in the joint ventures.
These leases provide the Group with some rights over alterations and adjacent land developments.
Some leases also provide the Group with options to purchase the other joint venturers equity stakes at a future point in time.
In some cases the Group has the ability to substitute properties in the joint ventures with alternative properties of similar value, subject to strict eligibility criteria.
In other cases, the Group carries out property management activities for third party rentals of shopping centre units.
The property investment activities are carried out in separate entities, usually partnerships or limited liability companies.
The Group has assessed its ability to direct the relevant activities of these entities and impact Group returns and concluded that the entities qualify as joint ventures since decisions regarding them require the unanimous consent of both equity holders.
This assessment included not only rights within the joint venture agreements, but also any rights within the other contractual arrangements between the Group and the entities.
The Group made a number of judgements and assertions in arriving at this determination, the key ones being: since the provisions of the joint venture agreements require the relevant decisions impacting investor returns to be either unanimously agreed by both joint venturers at the same time, or in some cases to be agreed sequentially by each venturer at different stages, there is joint decision making within the joint venture: since the Groups leases are priced at fair value, and any rights embedded in the leases are consistent with market practice, they do not provide the Group with additional control over the joint ventures or infer an obligation by the Group to fund the settlement of liabilities of the joint ventures: any options to purchase the other joint venturers equity stakes are priced at market value, and only exercisable at future dates, hence they do not provide control to the Group at the current time: where the Group has a right to substitute properties in the joint ventures, the rights are strictly limited and are at fair value, hence do not provide control to the Group: and where the Group carries out property management activities for third party rentals in shopping centres, these additional activities are controlled through joint venture agreements or lease agreements, and do not provide the Group with additional powers over the joint venture.
