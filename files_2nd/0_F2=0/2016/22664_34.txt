Overview01 Strategic report10 Governance53 Financial review87 Financial statements96 Other information150 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The company was incorporated on 6 September 2016.
The financial statements of the company reflect the period from incorporation to 31 December 2016.
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Financial Reporting Standard 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, in the period ended 31 December 2016 the company has decided to adopt FRS 101.
Accordingly, the financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 2015 and July 2016.
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash-flow statement and certain related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the re measurement of certain financial instruments to fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements except as noted below.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is Sterling, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
The Company has adopted US Dollars as the presentation currency for its financial statements, in line with the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
For the purpose of presenting individual company financial statements, assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into US Dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity, the currency translation reserve.
Investments Investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is offset against the merger reserve.
If the merger reserve is not sufficient to cover an impairment loss the excess impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Merger reserve As part of the Group reorganisation, the company entered into a common control transaction to acquire the former ConvaTec Group.
The Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Cidron Healthcare Limited and obtained full control of the ConvaTec Group.
As a common control transaction, this did not meet the definition of a business combination under IFRS 3 Business Combinations and as such, fell outside the scope of that standard.
As a consequence, after considering guidance from IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the transaction has been accounted for by applying merger accounting principles.
The fair value of the shares acquired, representing the fair value of the Group on the date of the IPO, was recorded as the fair value of the investment held.
The difference between the nominal value and the fair value of shares acquired was taken to the merger reserve.
Loss for the period As permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or statement of other comprehensive income for the period 6 September 2016 to 31 December 2016.
The loss attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Companys balance sheet.
The auditors remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
