An explanation of the use of alternative performance measures ApMs is provided on page 30.
1.1. net Revenue The groups primary source of revenue is management fees.
Management fees are based on an agreed percentage of the assets under management.
Initial charges and commissions include fees based on a set percentage of certain flows into our funds and profits earned on dealing within the unit trust managers box, known as box profits.
performance fees are earned from some funds when agreed performance conditions are met.
Net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements.
Revenue revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of investment management services.
revenue is shown net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts.
our primary revenue components are accounted for as follows: management fees are recognised in the period in which the service is performed and are calculated as a percentage of net fund assets managed in accordance with individual management agreements: initial charges and commissions on sales of unit trusts are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period of the provision of investment management services.
Box profits are calculated as the difference between the cost of purchasing redeemed units at cancellation prices and reselling them at creation prices.
Such box profits are recognised when the related transaction occurs: and performance fees are calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a defined hurdle and are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is virtually certain that the fee will be received.
Such fees are normally recognised at the end of the relevant reporting period of the fund.
fee and commission expenses These are paid to third parties for ongoing services under distribution agreements and are charged to the income statement over the period in which the service is expected to be provided.
The services provided include the provision of access to a basket of fund products, information on financial products, promotional materials, ongoing services to clients and transaction processing.

All financial, business and strategic decisions are made centrally by the Board of Directors the Board, which determines the key performance indicators of the group.
Information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Board, on a single segment basis.
While the group has the ability to analyse its underlying information in different ways, for example by product type, this information is only used to allocate resources and assess performance for the group as a whole.
on this basis, the group considers itself to be a single-segment investment management business.
Management monitors operating earnings, a non-gAAp measure see page 30, for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

Pension costs The group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees.
Contributions in respect of the uK employees at the rate of 15% of gross salary are made into the Jupiter pension Scheme whose financial statements are available from the trustees at the registered office of the Company.
No liability is included in the balance sheet as no obligations were outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Contributions made by the group are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.

The expense included within wages and salaries in the income statement in relation to fund units for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 3.0m 2015: 2.9m.
Where bonuses are deferred into fund units, the fair value of the award is spread over the vesting period and included within staff costs.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date to the expected settlement amount, being the current market value of the underlying fund unit.
Any increase or decrease in value is recognised in the income statement within staff costs.
The liability is included in the balance sheet as part of accrued expenses within trade and other payables see Note 3.9.
The group hedges its exposure to price fluctuations in the underlying fund units by purchasing the fund units at the date of grant.
These are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTpl on the balance sheet.
Any change in the fair value of the units is recognised in the income statement within other gains.
average number of employees The monthly average number of persons employed by the group during the year, including executive Directors, by activity is: 2016 2015 Fund management 66 61 Distribution and marketing 119 108 Infrastructure and operations 278 267 463 436 Information regarding Directors aggregate emoluments of 6.2m 2015: 7.5m is given in the remuneration report.
Annual report and Accounts 2016 97 SECTIoN 1: rESulTS For THE yEAr Notes to the group financial statements Income statement 1.5. shaRe-based Payments The group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees by granting the right to either shares or options over shares, subject to certain vesting conditions and exercise prices.
These have been accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments.
The fair value of the awards granted in the form of shares or share options is recognised as an expense over the appropriate performance and vesting period.
The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
The fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model, the principal inputs being the market value on the date of award, discounted for dividends foregone over the holding period of the award, and an adjustment for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the group and the number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions.
These estimates are reviewed regularly and the charge to the income statement is adjusted appropriately at the end of the relevant scheme as a minimum.
Shares and options vest on the occurrence of a specified event under the rules of the relevant plan.
The fair value of shares and options granted during the year to be charged over the vesting period was 17.6m 2015: 20.3m.
A summary of the charge taken to the income statement excluding social security for each share-based payment arrangement is shown below: 2016 2015 m m Interests in options under pre-listing Share plan 0.1 0.2 Deferred Bonus plan DBp 6.3 5.3 long-term Incentive plan lTIp 11.0 7.7 Sharesave plan SAyE 0.4 0.4 Share Incentive plan SIp 0.3 0.3 total note 1.4 18.1 13.9 The fair value of the services provided by employees has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Fair value amounts for the options granted under the DBp, lTIp and SAyE schemes were determined using a Black Scholes option-pricing method and the following assumptions: 2016 2015 dbP 2015 ltiP 2016 saye 2016 dbP 2014 ltiP 2015 saye 2015 Weighted average share price 4.10 4.11 4.54 4.10 4.21 4.25 Exercise price 0.02 3.43 0.02 3.45 Weighted average expected volatility % 27.7 28.0 30.4 27.1 29.0 27.7 Weighted average option life years 3.1 3.2 3.7 3.1 3.7 3.9 Weighted average dividend yield % 3.6 3.6 3.3 3.2 3.2 3.1 Weighted average risk-free interest rate % 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.7 0.9 0.9 Expected volatility for options granted in 2016 and 2015 has been calculated using the historical volatility of the group.
The numbers above in relation to the lTIp include Joiner plans as both schemes have a similar structure.
i interests in options under pre-listing share Plan These options were granted to certain employees prior to listing in June 2010 and allowed them to acquire shares at nominal value, subject to satisfying certain vesting and performance conditions.
The terms of the options allowed individuals to make a payment to the Company entitling them to take up rights to shares between one and five years after the grant date, depending on the individual award.
The interests in options under pre-listing Share plan were granted at the nominal price of 0.02, which gives them the characteristics of nil cost options and therefore the fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the award.

The group pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries in which it operates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current tax, but there is also a charge relating to tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes deferred tax.
Tax is charged to equity when the tax benefit exceeds the cumulative income statement expense on share plans.
The group provides for current tax according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns in respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is considered recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax that has arisen in respect of equity items such as share-based payments is recognised directly in equity and not in the income statement.

own shares are shares held in an Employee Benefit Trust EBT for the benefit of employees under the vesting, lock-in and other incentive arrangements in place.
Diluted EpS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year for the purpose of basic EpS plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purposes of calculating EpS, the share capital of the parent is calculated as the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue over the years reported.

Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill is carried at cost less provision for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if any indicators of impairment arise.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing, with the allocation to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
On 19 June 2007, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited, giving rise to a goodwill asset being recognised.
2016 2015 m m Goodwill 341.2 341.2 341.2 341.2 No additional goodwill was recognised in the year 2015: nil.
The Group has determined that it has a single CGU for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill.
In performing the impairment test, management prepares a calculation of the recoverable amount of the goodwill and compares this to the carrying value.
The recoverable amount for the acquired share capital was based on the net present value of the Groups future earnings.
The net present value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model, with reference to the Groups projected cash flows and cost of capital.
A significant headroom was noted, and therefore no impairment was implied.
No impairment losses have been recognised in the current or preceding years.
3.2. iNTANGiblE ASSETS In 2007, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited.
This acquisition gave rise to the recognition of intangible assets relating to investment management contracts and the trade name of the Group.
The other intangible assets recognised are computer software.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are held at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows CGUs.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value as at the date of acquisition.
In relation to the investment management contracts and the trade name, the useful lives are assessed as being finite and they are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for these assets are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The useful economic lives of the trade name and individual management contracts acquired are currently assessed as a maximum of ten years and seven years, respectively.
The remaining amortisation period of the trade name is 0.5 years: the investment management contracts are fully amortised.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis.
Computer software licences acquired are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the software into use and are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are estimated as being five years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that do not meet the capitalisation criteria under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset.
The difference is then recognised in the income statement.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that an asset in use may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is measured as the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Nonfinancial assets that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
The Directors have reviewed the intangible assets as at 31 December 2016 and have concluded there are no indicators of impairment 2015: same.

ProPErTy, PlANT ANd EquiPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they were incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Leasehold improvements 19 years the remaining period of the lease Office furniture and equipment 5 years The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial period end and adjusted if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, is included in the income statement in the year the item is sold or retired.

FiNANCiAl iNSTruMENTS hEld AT FAir vAluE Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument.
They are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except for financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss where transaction costs are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or where they have been transferred and the Group has also transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets include cash and shortterm deposits, trade and other receivables, seed capital investments and derivative financial instruments.
Financial assets are classified as being designated at FVTPL on initial recognition or as loans and receivables.
The classification adopted by the Group depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired and is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at FVTPL include investments in openended investment companies and unit trusts which are designated as at FVTPL as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the documented strategy.
A financial asset is classified in this category if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Financial assets at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other gains in the period in which they arise.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Where the Group is deemed to have control, the investment is consolidated.
Where the Group is deemed to have significant influence, the investment is classified as an investment in associate.
Further information is included in the Basis of consolidation in Note 5.1.
Financial liabilities The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and the noncontrolling interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other gains in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL relate to noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds which are designated as at FVTPL.
Further information is provided in Note 5.1.

Changes to UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2015 on 26 October 2015 and Finance Bill 2016 on 7 September 2016.
These include reductions of the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements.
TrAdE ANd oThEr rECEivAblES Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against trade receivables and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables, including loans to employees, are included in current assets except where they have maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as noncurrent assets.
Accrued income relates to accrued interest and accrued management, performance and registration fees.
It is based on the latest available information and therefore involves a degree of estimation related to the valuation of underlying AUM.

3.8. loANS ANd borrowiNGS The Group renewed its revolving credit facility RCF of 50.0m 2015: 50.0m during the year.
The facility expires in July 2019 and was undrawn at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016.
Interest on the RCF is payable at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.7%.
A nonutilisation fee is payable on the RCF at a rate of 0.25% per annum on the undrawn balance.
A utilisation fee is also payable at a rate of 0.3% per annum when more than 66% of the facility is drawn, and 0.1% per annum when 33% to 66% of the facility is drawn.
No utilisation fee is payable when less than 33% of the facility is drawn.
TrAdE ANd oThEr PAyAblES Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Accruals are based on the latest information and, therefore, involve a degree of estimation.
The most significant accruals at the year end relate to bonuses.
The Group recognises a provision for bonuses based on a formula that takes into consideration the operating profitability of the Group.
At the end of each financial year, the Group recognises a liability for bonuses accrued but not yet paid in respect of service attributable to that year.
This provision is recognised within accrued expenses.
Deferred income relates to initial charges being spread over the expected life of the contract on a straight line basis.

The holdings of this trust, which is funded by the Group, include shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group.
These shares are recorded at cost and are classified as own shares.
The shares are used to settle obligations that arise from the granting of sharebased awards.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 113 section 5: other notes Notes to the Group financial statements Other 5.1.
Basis of preparation and other accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRS IC Interpretations IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivatives that have been measured at fair value.
After reviewing the Groups current plans and forecasts and financing arrangements, as well as the current trading activities of the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 include the consolidated financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The accounting policies set out those policies that have been applied consistently in preparing the Group financial statements.
No new policies have been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed later in this note within the section titled Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an investee if the Group has all of the following: power over the investee: exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group assesses whether it is acting as an agent or principal for its holdings in its seed capital investments.
Where the Group concludes it is acting as a principal the entity is consolidated.
This assessment is based on the Groups total exposure.
This incorporates direct holdings and income earned from management and performance fees.
There is no fixed minimum percentage at which the Group consolidates, and each exposure is reviewed individually.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts or circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
A list of subsidiaries can be seen in Note 6.3.
Consistent accounting policies are applied across all Group companies and intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Seed capital investments are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates or other financial investments depending on the holdings of the Group and on the level of influence and control that the Group is judged to have.
The transactions and balances of subsidiaries are consolidated in these financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where external investors hold shares or redeemable shares in funds controlled by the Group, the portion of profit or loss and net assets held by these non-controlling interests is included within other gains in the consolidated income statement and as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated balance sheet respectively.
114 Jupiter Fund Management plc STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE financial stateMents OTHER INFORMATION ii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control.
Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence where it has voting rights of 20% or more, but not control of the investee.
Seed capital investments over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, are carried in the balance sheet at fair value as permitted by IAS 28, Investment in Associates, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The fair value of investments in associates is determined by reference to the quoted price or net asset value of the underlying investments at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The Group has no other investments in associates and, therefore, no associates are currently accounted for using the equity method.
foreign currency i Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial information of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is both the Companys functional and presentational currency as well as the currency in which the majority of the Groups revenue streams, assets and liabilities are denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of other gains.
iii Group companies The assets and liabilities of Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date, with income and expenses translated at average exchange rates.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income and are recycled to the income statement on disposal or liquidation of the relevant branch or subsidiary.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 115 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other 5.1.
Basis of preparation and other accounting policies CONTINUED new standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS Interpretations Committee have issued a number of new accounting standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations.
The following new standards are not applicable to these financial statements, but are expected to have an impact when they become effective.
The Group plans to apply these standards in the reporting period in which they become effective.
effective for periods beginning not yet endorsed by the eu summary on or after Replacement project on financial instruments consists of three phases: 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities: Phase 2: Impairment methodology: and Phase 3: Hedge accounting Establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts revenue arising from contracts with customers.
It will supersede the current with Customers revenue standard IAS 18 Revenue Provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 Leases and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
It will supersede the current guidance found in IAS 17 Leases There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The adoption of the accounting standards endorsed but not yet applied above are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for IFRS 16.
The Group expects the adoption of IFRS 16 to significantly increase the Groups total assets and liabilities as a result of the requirement to capitalise both the right to use leased assets and the contractual payments to be made under lease obligations.
As a result of the liability being calculated using discounting, the income statement charge for lease payments is expected to be larger in the earlier years of a lease, and smaller in the later years.
In addition, the rental charge, previously recognised as a single administrative charge within the income statement, will be split into a depreciation charge relating to the capitalised asset within administrative expenses and a finance cost representing the unwinding of the discount.
critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of the financial information requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial information, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements are discussed in the following notes: 1.5 Share-based payments 3.1 Impairment of goodwill 3.6 Accrued income 3.9 Accrued expenses 5.2. financial coMMitMents The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases on office properties are shown below.

Level 2: other techniques, for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Investments in associates and financial assets at FVTPL These relate to seed capital investments and hedges of awards in fund units in mutual funds.
Details are included in Note 5.4.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL These relate to non-controlling interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
level 2 financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments are valued based on a compilation of observable market data from readily available from external sources.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price to exit the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value are included in the income statement.
The Group enters into swap arrangements and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain of its seed capital investments.
Gains and losses arising from fair value movements in the swap and forward contracts are recognised in the consolidated income statement within other gains and are settled periodically, in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Any cash settlements due from or to the counterparty in relation to the swap arrangements, which are required to be settled at the end of each month, are recorded within current assets or current liabilities as trade receivables or other payables, as appropriate.
The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts, which are required to be settled at periods other than at the month end, are recorded within financial assets or liabilities at FVTPL, as appropiate.
118 Jupiter Fund Management plc STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE financial stateMents OTHER INFORMATION At 31 December 2016, the notional value of the swaps was 39.3m 2015: 30.7m and the foreign exchange forward contracts was 28.4m 2015: 12.7m.
The settlement amount of the swaps at 31 December 2016 was 0.8m, which was due to the counterparty and is included within trade and other payables 2015: 0.8m due from the counterparty and included within trade and other receivables.
The fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts was 0.4m and is included within financial liabilities at FVTPL 2015: 0.3m.
financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is subject to a number of financial risks throughout its business, the principal risks being market risk including price, foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board is accountable for risk and is responsible for oversight of the risk management process.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk strategy of the Group, and for determining an appropriate risk appetite and tolerance levels within which the Group must operate.
By defining these, the Board demonstrates that it is aware of and, where appropriate, has taken steps to mitigate the impact of risks that may have a material impact on the Group.
The Executive Committee reviews the key corporate risks facing the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility for the governance of the risk management of the firm, but delegates the risk and control framework to the Head of Risk, who has responsibility for the monitoring and reporting of risk and controls, and through the Risk Committee manages the ongoing development of the Groups risk and control framework.
Jupiter embeds risk management within the business, with independent oversight and challenge being provided by the risk function.
price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets will adversely impact the profitability of the Group.
Management has identified price risk as the exposure to unfavourable movements in the value of financial assets held by the Group, which would result in a loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group holds listed equity investments in its seed capital portfolio which are exposed to the risk of changes in equity markets.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value, and therefore maximum exposure to listed securities, was 58.7m 2015: 47.3m.
The Groups policy is to hedge the equity market and currency exposure of its seed capital investments depending on the fund mandate and whether available transactions are cost effective.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the Group held swap instruments to act as hedges against risk exposures arising from certain holdings in seed fund investments.
price risk sensitivity analysis on financial assets The Directors believe that 10% gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to price risk.
An increase or decrease of 10% in equity markets would have the following impact on the profit before taxation and equity of the Group.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity.
2016 2015 Impact on the income statement of change in equity markets m m 10% 3.9 3.3 -10% 3.9 3.3 The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into in order to provide a hedge against such movements.
foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group predominantly operates in the UK, with some transactions from overseas third parties in foreign currencies, which create exposure to non-sterling income and expenses.
The Groups policy is to hold the minimum amount of currency required to cover operational needs and to convert foreign currency on receipt.
Direct exposures are limited to operational cash held in overseas subsidiaries, short-term outstanding currency fee debts and investments in seed capital denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group does not normally hedge this risk, other than in the case of certain seed capital investments, which are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts.
These contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk is monitored closely and managed by the finance function.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis The Directors believe that 10% gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk arises principally through operational cash balances held in foreign currencies and seed capital investments held in non-Sterling share classes.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 119 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other 5.3. financial risk ManageMent CONTINUED interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Groups cash balances Note 3.7.
The Group manages interest rate risk via the finance function monitoring of the interest rate cash flow risks and returns.
The Group puts cash on deposit at fixed rates of interest for periods of up to three months.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The Directors believe that a movement in interest rates of 50bps gives a reasonable measure of the Groups sensitivity to interest rate risk.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax mainly through the impact on floating rate cash deposits.
2016 2015 Impact on the income statement of change in interest rates m m 50 bps 1.3 1.3 50 bps 0.8 0.8 credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a financial loss in the Groups operating activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily from its treasury activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, but also from its trade receivables and, in certain circumstances, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade receivables arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss expose the Group to credit risk where seed capital investments in funds are consolidated and those funds hold investments in debt instruments or derivative positions with a positive fair value.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is 335.0m 2015: 337.2m, represented by the carrying value of its non-equity financial assets at FVTPL 8.6m 2015: 11.1m, trade receivables 67.5m 2015: 66.7m and cash and cash equivalents 258.9m 2015: 259.4m.
The fair values of the Groups financial liabilities at FVTPL are not affected by changes in the Groups credit risk.
There is no difference between the carrying amount of financial liabilities at FVTPL and the amount the Group would be contractually required to pay at maturity.
With regard to credit risk related to financial instruments, the Groups policy is to place deposits only with financial institutions which satisfy minimum ratings and other criteria set by the Counterparty Review Group CRG.
Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and thereby mitigate the possibility of financial loss through counterparty failure.
The CRG monitors the Groups counterparty exposures.

120 Jupiter Fund Management plc STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE financial stateMents OTHER INFORMATION liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due or only at a significantly higher cost.
The Group produces cash flow forecasts to assist in the efficient management of the collection and payment of liquid assets and liabilities.
The Groups objectives in respect of liquidity are: l ensuring both the Group as a whole and individual entities within the Group have access to sufficient liquid funds to trade solvently and meet trading liabilities as they fall due: l allowing the Group to maintain a flexible dividend policy, taking reference to prior year and prospective profitability, captal requirements and cash flow: and l providing the Group with appropriate flexibility over the transferability of its capital and cash balances.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balances required for working capital management is held in interest bearing deposits of up to three months.
Regulated companies ensure that sufficient capital is maintained to meet regulatory requirements.
During the year, the Group renewed its revolving credit facility RCF of 50m which was unutilised at 31 December 2016 2015: same.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 based on contractual undiscounted payments: Financial liabilities 2016 2015 Within Within 1 year or 1 year or repayable repayable on demand 1-5 years 5 years total on demand 1-5 years 5 years total m m m m m m m m Trade and other payables 137.1 4.1 141.2 130.1 3.2 133.3 Financial liabilities at FVTPL 13.4 13.4 9.9 9.9 total 150.5 4.1 154.6 140.0 3.2 143.2 capital management The Groups objectives when managing its capital and funding structure are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, maintain appropriate financial resources, maximise shareholder value, maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital and to meet working capital requirements.

The subsidiaries within the Group which are regulated are required to maintain capital resources to comply with the regulatory capital requirements of the FCA and certain overseas financial regulators.
All regulated entities within the Group complied with the externally imposed regulatory capital requirements.
Headroom over regulatory capital is discussed by the Balance Sheet Management Committee.
Further information on the Balance Sheet Management Committee can be found in the Management Committees overview within the Governance section.
In addition to the capital held to meet the regulatory capital requirements, the Group maintains sufficient cash resources to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due, based on regularly produced cash forecasts, modelling both normal and stressed conditions.
Liquidity risk is mitigated by the availability of the RCF and the high level of cash in the business.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 121 SECTION 5: OTHER NOTES Notes to the Group financial statements Other 5.4. interests in structured entities IFRS 12 requires certain disclosures in respect of interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities.
A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
The Group has assessed whether the funds it manages are structured entities and concluded that mutual funds and investment trusts managed by the Group are structured entities unless substantive removal or liquidation rights exist.
The Group has interests in these funds through the receipt of management and other fees and, in certain funds, through ownership of fund units.
The Groups investments in these funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective funds offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk.
The investments are included in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in the statement of financial position.
Where the Group has no equity holding in a fund it manages, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Groups maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees and any uncollected fees at the balance sheet date.
Where the Group does have an equity holding, the maximum exposure to loss constitutes the future and uncollected management fees plus the fair value of the Groups investment in that fund.
The Group does not sponsor any of the structured entities and there are no guarantees or commitments.
direct holdings in unconsolidated structured entities Direct investments in unconsolidated structured entities comprise seed capital investments and hedges of awards in fund units in mutual funds, details of which are given below: investment management Management financial performance performance net auM assets investment in fees fees number of funds at fVtpl associates in the year receivable of funds bn m m m m as at 31 december 2016 33 23.3 70.9 7.3 220.1 12.7 As at 31 December 2015 32 26.5 58.2 5.3 290.3 11.7 subsidiaries and associates Information about seed capital investments judged to be subsidiaries and associates at 31 December 2016 is given below: financial investment percentage date of the assets in of total share class end of the funds country of principal at fVtpl associates shares held by the reporting name category incorporation activities m m held group period Jupiter Global Fund SICAV: UK D GBP Acc and Dynamic Growth Subsidiary Luxembourg SICAV 3.6 100% L GBP Acc 30 September sub-fund Jupiter Global Fund SICAV: D USD Acc Global Emerging Markets SICAV and L USD Unconstrained Subsidiary Luxembourg sub-fund 21.1 79% Acc 30 September Jupiter Enhanced Distribution Fund Subsidiary England & Wales Unit trust 18.1 57% I Class Acc 31 March Jupiter US Small and Midcap Companies Fund Associate England & Wales Unit trust 7.3 27% I Instl Acc 30 June related undertakings other than subsidiaries and associates Entities in which the Group holds more than 20 per cent.
