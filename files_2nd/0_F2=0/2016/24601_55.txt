Hays plc | 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements 120 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The life expectancy assumptions have been calculated using Club Vita base tables and future improvements in line with the CMI 2013 model with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% per annum and non peaked short-term future improvements.
On this basis a 65-year-old current pensioner has a life expectancy of 24.3 years and 24.8 years for males and females respectively.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the Schemes liabilities at the year end is: Change in Impact on assumption Schemes Discount rate 0.5% 88m RPI inflation 0.5% 55m Assumed life expectancy at age 60 rate of mortality 1 year 29m The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation to one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
