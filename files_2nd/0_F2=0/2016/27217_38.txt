Notes to the Consolidated Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2016 For the year ended 31 December 2016 1 Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of National Express Group PLC and its subsidiaries the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 23 February 2017.
National Express Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Strategic Report that accompanies these Financial Statements.
2 Accounting policies Statement of compliance These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC as adopted by the European Union EU, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Basis of preparation These Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis see Group Finance Directors Review on page 45 under the historical cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments.
Prior year figures in the Group Income Statement and related notes have been restated to present separately the amounts relating to operations classified as discontinued in the current year.
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand pounds 0.1m except where otherwise indicated.
A summary of the Groups accounting policies applied in preparing these Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 is set out below.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
i Critical accounting judgements Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Determining the amount of the Groups retirement benefit obligations and the net costs of providing such benefits requires judgements to be made concerning long-term interest rates, inflation, salary and pension increases, investment returns and longevity of current and future pensioners.
Changes in these judgements could significantly impact the amount of the obligations or the cost of providing such benefits.
The Group makes assumptions concerning these matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Details of the assumptions made are set out in note 34 to these Financial Statements.
ii Key sources of estimation uncertainty Goodwill impairment Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to make assumptions about perpetual growth rates, estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
This is materially relevant to the carrying value of goodwill in the Groups Spain and Morocco and North America divisions.
Details of the assumptions used and key sensitivities are set out in note 14 to these Financial Statements.
Insurance and other claims The estimation of the claims provision is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the Balance Sheet date but for which claims have not been reported to the Group.
The Group makes assumptions concerning these judgemental matters with the assistance of advice from independent qualified actuaries.
Insurance provisions are disclosed in note 26 to these Financial Statements.

Adjustments are made to bring any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist into line with the Groups accounting policies.
On acquisition of a business, the purchase method of accounting is adopted, and the Group Income Statement includes the results of subsidiaries and businesses purchased during the year from the date control is assumed.
The purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group Income Statement includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.
Intra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of comprehensive income and equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the parent Company shareholders and is presented separately from parent shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Changes in accounting policies and the adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except as noted below relating to German Rail revenue recognition, and there have been no changes in accounting standards during the year that have had a material effect on the Group.
Interests in joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties to share control of other entities which represent joint ventures.
The Group recognises its interest in the entities assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting.
The Group Balance Sheet includes the appropriate share of these joint ventures net assets or liabilities and the Income Statement includes the appropriate share of their results after tax.
Financial statements of joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Adjustments are made in the Groups Financial Statements to eliminate the Groups share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures.
The Group ceases to use the equity method from the date it no longer has joint control over the entity.
Interests in associates Companies, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the appropriate share of these associates results and net assets based on their latest financial statements under the equity method of accounting.
Income Statement presentation The Group Income Statement has been presented in a columnar format to enable users of the Financial Statements to view the normalised results of the Group.
Normalised results are defined as the statutory results excluding intangible asset amortisation and tax relief thereon.
The Board believes that the normalised result gives a better indication of the underlying performance of the Group.
Revenue recognition Rendering of services Revenue comprises income from road passenger transport, train passenger services and related activities in the UK, North America, Morocco and Europe.
Where relevant, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as a proportion of total services to be provided.
Rail revenue in the UK includes amounts attributed to the train operating companies TOCs, based principally on agreed models of route usage by Railway Settlement Plan Limited which administers the income allocation system within the UK rail industry, in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, net franchise agreement receipts from the Department for Transport Rail Division DfT Rail and local Passenger Transport Executives are treated as revenue.
Net franchise agreement payments to DfT Rail are recognised in operating costs.

UK Bus and Spain and Morocco revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local transport authorities, which is recognised as the services are provided.
For all the divisions noted above, the relevant share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within liabilities and released to the Income Statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard.
North America revenue from school boards and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided.
On 13 December 2015 the Group commenced operations in German Rail and as a result we have amended our existing revenue recognition policy for this new business.
Rail revenue in Germany comprises passenger revenues and subsidy income receivable from the Public Transport Authorities.
Passenger revenue, which is allocated between the various transport providers in each region by the tariff authority responsible for that region, is recognised based on passenger counts, tariff authority estimates and historical trends.
Subsidy income is recognised over the life of each franchise based on contractual entitlements including, where appropriate, indexation and other adjustments made or expected to be made to the subsidy entitlement.
In accordance with IAS 20, the subsidy income recognised in each period reflects a systematic allocation of the total contractual subsidy entitlement, based on the expected profile of the underlying cost base which the subsidy is intended to compensate.
Following our first year of operations in Germany we are working with the local transport authorities on clarifying certain aspects of subsidy revenue entitlement.
Our revenue policy is to only recognise revenue where these discussions are suitably advanced and where amounts are considered probable.
Rental income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance income Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the Income Statement on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
Specifically, government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in liabilities as deferred income and are credited to the Income Statement over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Segmental reporting Each of the Groups reportable segments provides services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other segments.
Due to the nature of the Groups operations the distinct business segments align directly with geographical segments which are operating in separate economic environments.
The Groups continuing segments comprise: UK Bus: UK Coach: German Rail: North America operates school bus and transit services : Spain and Morocco operates bus and coach services : and Central functions.
These segments are described in more detail in the Business review accompanying these Financial Statements.
Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group are capitalised in the Balance Sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the Balance Sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the Income Statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
All material arrangements and transactions entered into by the Group are reviewed to check whether they contain elements that meet the accounting definition of a lease, although they may not follow the legal form of a lease.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

Income taxes are recognised in the Income Statement unless they relate to an item accounted for in Other Comprehensive Income or Equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income or Equity.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of all material temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, apart from the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill: where an asset or liability is recognised in a transaction that is not a business combination and that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale and either represents a separate major line of business or geographical area: is part of a plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area: or was an acquired subsidiary intended for resale.
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and presented as a single amount after tax.
Comparatives are also re-presented to reclassify the operation as discontinued.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are capitalised at cost and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, finite life assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are not amortised.
The amortisation expense is taken to the Income Statement through operating costs.
Finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer contracts over the life of the contract between 1 and 33 years Contract mobilisation costs over the life of the franchise 15 years Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment.
The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Finite life assets are reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
The Groups only indefinite life intangible asset is goodwill.
Software Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the Income Statement over its estimated useful life three to seven years.
The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Following initial recognition, goodwill is stated at historical cost less any accumulated impairment.
If an acquisition gives rise to an excess of the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost previously referred to as negative goodwill, this is credited immediately to the Income Statement.
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised.
All goodwill is subject to an annual test of impairment and an impairment charge recognised as required.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended within one year of the acquisition if required, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post acquisition.
On disposal of a cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Land and buildings comprise mainly vehicle depots and garages, and offices.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Long leasehold property 15 to 40 years improvements Public service vehicles 8 to 16 years Plant and equipment, fixtures 3 to 15 years and fittings Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the Income Statement in the period of derecognition.
Impairment of non-financial assets All non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, except for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill which are reviewed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows.
In assessing value in use, the estimated risk adjusted future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Except for goodwill impairments, a review is made at each reporting date of any previous impairment losses to assess whether they no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and any previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to assess the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased, subject to a limit of the assets net book value had no previous impairment loss been recognised.
Such reversal is recognised in the Income Statement.
Future depreciation or amortisation is then adjusted to allocate the assets revised carrying amount over its remaining useful economic life.
Impairments to goodwill cannot be reversed.

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: and available-for-sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the Income Statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the Income Statement within finance costs in the period in which they arise.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
The Groups investments in entities that are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the Income Statement.
Where there is no active market for the Groups investments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flow analyses.
In the absence of any other reliable external information, assets are carried at cost or amortised cost as appropriate.
The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for availablefor-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities When a financial liability is recognised initially, the Group measures it at its fair value.
Financial liabilities include trade payables, accruals, other payables, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
In the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, an adjustment is made for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability.
Subsequent measurement depends on its classification as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities classified as held for trading and derivative liabilities that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
These liabilities are carried on the Balance Sheet at fair value with gains or losses being recognised in the Income Statement.
Other All other financial liabilities not classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported Balance Sheet.
The fair value of the derivatives is calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end.
The Groups fuel derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity, with any material ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the Income Statement.
The Groups interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted through the Income Statement for the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in this case movements in the risk free interest rate.
Foreign currency derivatives and cross currency swaps are used to hedge the Groups net investment in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against foreign exchange exposure in the related assets and liabilities.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain transactional exposures.
These contracts are not hedge accounted and all gains and losses are taken directly to the Income Statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the Income Statement in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in-first out basis, after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Contract mobilisation costs Costs associated with securing new rail franchises and other significant non-rail contracts are expensed as incurred up to the point when a bid is awarded.
From this point in time, appropriate costs are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the Income Statement over the life of the contract.
Costs associated with the commencement of all other new contracts are expensed as incurred.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Doubtful debts are provided for when collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the Statement of Cash Flows comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short-term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception, and bank overdrafts.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, cash includes cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost being the net fair value of the consideration received plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial asset or liability.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

To provide protection above these types of losses, the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
The insurance provision is based on estimated exposures at the year end principally for claims arising in the UK and North America prior to the year end date, subject to the overall deductible within the Groups insurance arrangements.
The majority of provisions will be utilised within five years, and the provisions have been discounted to take account of the expected timing of future cash settlements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has a number of pension schemes, both of a defined benefit and defined contribution nature.
Full details are provided in note 34.
The Balance Sheet position in respect of defined benefit schemes comprises the net of the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date and the fair value of plan assets.
Recognition of a net asset is limited so that it does not exceed the economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The trustees complete a full actuarial valuation triennially, separately for each plan, but the obligation is updated annually for financial reporting purposes by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity equivalent to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised in staff pension costs within operating costs in the Income Statement.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.
Our UK TOCs participate in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a defined benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK rail industry.
This is partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding of these sections whilst it operates the relevant franchise.
In contrast to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the employee.
A liability is recognised in line with other defined benefit schemes in the Group, although this is offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability represents the deficit that the Group expects to fund during the franchise term.
The charges in respect of defined contribution schemes are recognised when they are due.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Share-based payment The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market service and performance vesting conditions for example profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
At each Balance Sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a pre-tax discount rate.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingent liabilities are obligations that arise from past events that are dependent on future events.
They are disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements where the expected future outflow is not probable.

Any consideration subsequently received on sale or re-issue is included in shareholders equity.
Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups Financial Statements on the date when dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Foreign currencies The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling, the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year as a reasonable approximation to actual exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
The balance sheets of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity.
On disposal of a foreign currency denominated subsidiary, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 relating to that entity is recognised in the Income Statement.
All other translation differences are taken to the Income Statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to provide a hedge against the Group net investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the Income Statement.
New standards and interpretations not applied At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the Group has not applied the following Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective and, for IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, have not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard deals with the classification, recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The standard establishes the principles for reporting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.
The Directors have assessed the following: IFRS 9 may impact both the measurement and disclosures of the Groups financial instruments.
IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on future financial statements.
IFRS 16 is expected to result in a material increase to both the assets and liabilities of the Group and may also impact the timing of recognition of operating and finance costs.
A full assessment of the impact of these new standards is in progress.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of their effect until the review has been completed.
In addition to the above, there have been a number of revisions to existing standards issued that are also not yet effective.
These revisions are not likely to have a significant impact on future financial statements.

5 Segmental analysis The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the public transport services they provide.
The geographical markets they operate in match the nature of public transport services provided.
Commentary on the segments is included in the Strategic Report.
The results of the UK Rail division have been excluded from the segmental analysis below as it has been classified as a discontinued operation.
Revenue is analysed by reportable segment as follows: External Segment InterInterrevenue revenue External segment Segment segment revenue sales revenue restated sales restated 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 m m m m m m UK Bus 285.4 1.4 286.8 285.1 1.3 286.4 UK Coach 282.5 0.3 282.8 280.9 0.3 281.2 German Rail 61.3 61.3 2.4 2.4 Spain and Morocco 597.3 597.3 502.2 502.2 North America 877.2 877.2 683.2 683.2 Inter-segment sales elimination 1.7 1.7 1.6 1.6 Total revenue 2,103.7 2,103.7 1,753.8 1,753.8 Inter-segment sales in UK Bus represent the provision of coach services on a small number of routes to UK Coach and internal commission on ticket sales.
Inter-segment sales in UK Coach represent rail replacement services provided to Rail.
Inter-segment trading is undertaken on standard arms length commercial terms.
Due to the nature of the Groups businesses, the origin and destination of revenue is the same.
No single external customer amounts to 10% or more of the total revenue.

Under the LTIP, a Performance Award to acquire a specified number of free shares may be made to the employee or Director.
In addition, a Matching Award may be made, as described in ii below.
Performance conditions are attached to the vesting of Performance and Matching Awards based on the achievement of target growth in earnings per share EPS, return on capital employed ROCE and the relative total shareholder return TSR of the Company against a comparator group of companies.
If the performance conditions are met, Performance and Matching Awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to six months following the vesting date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives at present.
Since 2011, HMRC approved share option plans were added as an appendix to the LTIP Approved Plan.
A participant can only hold an option under the Approved Plan over shares with a market value of up to 30,000 at the grant date.
Options under the Approved Plan are granted in tandem with the usual options under the LTIP.
The options are structured such that on exercise, the proportion of the gain in respect of the first 30,000 worth of shares as measured at the date of grant will be delivered under the Approved Plan and the LTIP option shall be scaled back to deliver the remaining gross gain that would have been delivered had the option been granted alone.
The excess shares under the LTIP will be forfeited such that both awards will never become fully vested.
From 2012 to 2014, a supplementary five-year long-term incentive award was granted to the Chief Executive subject to targets linked to the Groups five-year plan.
This comprised a Performance Award with no matching element.
If performance conditions are met, the Performance Award will vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and remain exercisable for a period of up to 12 months following the vesting date.
ii Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan is a discretionary scheme which forms part of the bonus arrangements for certain senior employees.
Under the scheme, part of any bonus may be received in cash whilst the remainder is used to make an award of nil cost options which vest three years after the award date.
iii West Midlands Travel Ltd WMT Long Service Option Scheme The WMT Long Service Option Scheme utilises a fixed amount of shares set aside for this purpose following the acquisition of WMT in 1995 and is open to all WMT employees who have been in service for more than 25 years.
The options are exercisable between three and ten years following the grant date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
iv TWM Share Incentive Plan the SIP The TWM SIP exists for the benefit of WMT employees.
At the end of the year, 1,079 2015: 1,079 National Express Group PLC shares were held for the benefit of the Trustee.
Dividends on shares held in the SIP forfeited shares account are waived.
v Executive Deferred Bonus Plan As detailed in the Directors Remuneration Report, the Committee considered it appropriate for bonuses awarded in respect of the calendar year to be deferred for a period of one year and that these would vest, subject to the terms of the award and the relevant Directors continuing employment.
The deferred forfeitable ordinary shares are awarded under the terms of the National Express Group Executive Deferred Bonus Plan which was adopted by the Board of the Company on 10 March 2009.
The principal terms of awards under the Executive Deferred Bonus Plan are summarised below: Awards under the Plan may be cash awards, conditional awards or forfeitable shares awards Awards normally vest one year from the date of grant, subject to the relevant Directors continued employment with the Company The Committee may decide that participants shall be entitled to receive a benefit determined by reference to the value of the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the grant date and the date of vesting The awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment save in certain compassionate good leaver circumstances eg death or disability In the event of a variation of the share capital of the Company, the Committee may make such adjustments to the awards as it considers appropriate.

The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: 2016 2015 Exercise price p Number Number 0-350 178,704 170,210 351-600 36,663 96,382 215,367 266,592 The options have a weighted average contractual life of one year 2015: one year.
Options were exercised regularly throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 347p 2015: 314p.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without nil exercise price Share options with nil exercise price 2016 2015 2016 2015 Risk free interest rate 0.84% 1.09%-1.36% 0.37% 0.73% Expected volatility 26.0% 25.0%-26.0% 22.0% 24.0% Peer group volatility 23.0%-25.0% 22.0%-25.0% Expected option life in years 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.42% 3.53%-3.63% 0.0% 0.0% Weighted average share price at grant date 332p 295p 347p 314p Weighted average exercise price at grant date 329p 295p nil nil Weighted average fair value of options at grant date 52p 44p 312p 280p Experience to date has shown that approximately 24% 2015: 24% of options are exercised early, principally due to leavers.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historical volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.

Items expected to recur in the tax reconciliation for 2017 include the difference in rates between the UK and our overseas markets, tax incentives on re-investment credits and the merger of our Spanish businesses, and the effect of the debt financing of our overseas subsidiaries.
d Tax provisions At 31 December 2015, the Group held tax provisions of 12.7m to cover tax uncertainties across our various markets.
During 2016, a tax audit into our Moroccan business was initiated for the periods 2012 to 2015.
The matters which have been disputed relate to services provided by our Spanish business, use of losses carried forward and the tax deductibility of repairs.
It is expected that this tax audit will conclude in 2017 and if a tax payment is made to settle the periods then it is expected to be immaterial.
No other significant tax audits have been initiated across our businesses in the UK, Spain, Germany, the US or Canada in 2016.
All UK corporation tax returns up to 2014 have been submitted and agreed by HMRC except for one outstanding matter.
As a consequence of relatively few outstanding tax issues being contested by tax authorities and the closure of further tax returns as various statutes have closed, it was decided that 7.3m of the tax provisions are no longer required to cover tax uncertainties and 7.3m was credited to the tax line.
The balance of 5.4m of tax provisions represents a number of tax uncertainties such as the deductibility of interest expense in some of our markets and the Moroccan tax audits.
Based on the experience of the Group Tax department and after discussions of the various tax uncertainties with our tax advisers, the tax provision of 5.4m represents managements best estimate of the tax uncertainties of which we are aware.
The provision for the Groups tax uncertainties of 5.4m is included in current tax liabilities.
e Temporary differences associated with Group investments No deferred tax 2015: nil is recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, as the Group has determined that these undistributed profits will not be distributed in the near future.
As a result of changes to tax legislation in 2009, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are generally exempt from UK corporation tax, but may be subject to withholding tax.
There are no temporary differences 2015: nil associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised but for which a tax liability may arise.
f Unrecognised tax losses Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit against future taxable profits is probable.
Based on current forecasts, it is estimated that the losses recognised for deferred tax purposes will be utilised within three to four years.
UK and overseas deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the Financial Statements relates to gross losses of 16.5m 2015: 38.2m, which arise in tax jurisdictions where the Group does not expect to generate sufficient suitable future taxable profits.
The majority of the unrecognised losses relates to UK entities where it is uncertain when, or if, the losses will be utilised.
In addition, there are capital losses of nil 2015: 2.2m relating to the US business that have not been recognised.

At the Balance Sheet date, the 17% rate 2015: rates 19% and 18% was substantively enacted.
The change in rate has resulted in a tax charge of 1.2m to the Income Statement.
11 Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale On 10 February 2017, the Group disposed of the National Express Essex Thameside c2c franchise to Trenitalia.
Following initial partnership discussions during 2016, Trenitalia made an offer to the Group to acquire the franchise.
After a period of negotiation it was formally announced in early January 2017 that an in principle agreement had been reached.
On 10 February, the Department for Transport granted final consent for the transaction to complete and Trenitalia commenced operation of the c2c franchise from that date.
The assets and liabilities of the franchise have been classified as held for sale in the Balance Sheet and comprise the following: 2016 m Property, plant and equipment 19.3 Defined benefit pension asset 37.7 Trade and other receivables 14.7 Cash and cash equivalents 6.3 Total assets held for sale 78.0 Trade and other payables 52.2 Current tax liability 0.9 Deferred tax liability 6.9 Provisions 0.1 Total liabilities held for sale 60.1 Net assets 17.9 Following the negotiations and decision in the year to dispose of the Groups only remaining UK rail franchise, the UK Rail operating segment has been recognised as a discontinued operation.

Basic EPS for continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings from the continuing Group attributable to equity shareholders of 113.3m 2015: 105.6m.
Basic and diluted EPS in the year for discontinued operations was 0.8p 2015: 0.3p.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

The key assumptions used for the cash-generating units are as follows: Growth rate used to Pre-tax discount extrapolate cash flows rate applied to beyond three-year period of cash flow projections management plan 2016 2015 2016 2015 UK Coach 8.2% 8.2% 2.6% 2.2% North America 8.1% 8.1% 3.8% 2.8% Spain and Morocco 8.2% 8.2% 2.6% 2.2% The growth rates used to extrapolate cash flow projections are derived from financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period.
The assumptions in these budgets and forecasts, which include growth rates and operating margins, are based on historical experience and detailed budget plans as well as managements assessment of current market and economic conditions.
Growth has then been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are calculated from a uniform discount rate derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC, which forms the basis for all internal investment analysis.
The Group regularly commissions professional advisors to assess the WACC.
The value in use of the North America division exceeds its carrying amount by 252.2m 2015: 455.1m.
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation, and this indicates that the value in use of the division will be equal to its carrying amount following an increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 260 basis points 2015: 290 basis points or a reduction in the growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period of the management plan of 150 basis points 2015: 340 basis points.
The value in use of the Spain and Morocco division exceeds its carrying amount by 262.0m 2015: 121.9m.
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation, and this indicates that the value in use of the division will be equal to its carrying amount following an increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 140 basis points 2015: 80 basis points or a reduction in growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period of the management plan of 160 basis points 2015: 80 basis points.
For both Spain and Morocco and North America the asset base is more than offset by future profit projections.
It is believed that any reasonably possible movement on key assumptions will not lead to an impairment of goodwill allocated to UK Coach.
Sensitivities to other assumptions In North America, a reduction in operating profit margin of 160 basis points 2015: 320 basis points will result in the value in use of the division being equal to its carrying amount.
In Spain and Morocco, a reduction in operating profit margin of 250 basis points 2015: 140 basis points will also result in the value in use of the division being equal to its carrying amount.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash-generating unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.

The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected was nil.
Goodwill of 56.5m arising from the acquisitions consists of certain intangible benefits that cannot be separately identified and measured due to their nature.
This includes control over the acquired businesses and increased scale in our North American operations, along with synergy benefits expected to be achieved.
Included in the consideration shown above is contingent consideration of 8.6m, relating to three acquisitions.
For two of the acquisitions the Group is required to pay consideration upon meeting agreed revenue levels over a period of one year.
For the third agreement, the Group is required to pay consideration based upon meeting an agreed EBITDA level over three years.
The maximum payment under these arrangements is dependent on meeting the respective revenue and EBITDA levels, and the minimum payment is nil.
Based on projections, management expects the discounted value of payments to be the maximum amount of 8.6m.
Acquisition-related costs included within the Groups operating profit for the year amounted to 0.4m.
The acquired businesses contributed 49.1m of revenue and 12.9m to the Groups profit for the periods between the dates of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
Had the acquisitions been completed on the first day of the financial year, the Groups continuing revenue for the period would have been 2,160.9m and the Groups continuing operating profit would have been 189.7m.
Deferred consideration of 6.1m 2015: 0.2m was paid in the year relating to acquisitions in North America in earlier years.

In November 2016, the Group issued a 400m seven-year Sterling bond with a coupon of 2.5%.
The proceeds were used to repay the 350m Sterling bond that matured in January 2017, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes.
A 350m bridge facility and 100m facility were taken out last year to provide the Group with an appropriate level of liquidity prior to refinancing the bond and these were cancelled following the issuance of the new 400m bond.
Under the terms of the 1bn Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme, there is a change in control put option such that, upon a change of control event, any note holder may require the Company to redeem or purchase that MTN.
Details of the Groups interest rate risk management strategy and associated interest rate derivatives are included in notes 30 and 31.
The Group is subject to a number of financial covenants in relation to its syndicated credit facilities which, if contravened, could result in its borrowings under those facilities becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify maximum net debt to EBITDA and minimum EBITDA to net interest payable.

The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to manage the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group by using financial instruments including borrowings, committed facilities and forward foreign exchange, fuel and interest rate derivatives.
The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility for implementing the financial risk management policies laid down by the Board to the Group Finance Director and the Group Treasurer.
The policies are implemented by the Group Treasury department with regular reporting to the Group Finance Director and the Audit Committee on its activities.

These movements can have a significant impact on the Groups reported results.
The Group seeks to manage this foreign currency exchange movement risk by aligning its foreign currency denominated liabilities with the EBIT generated in each currency, such that some protection is afforded to the net debt: EBITDA covenant within the Groups core borrowing facility.
This is achieved by a combination of foreign currency borrowings and finance leases, and entering into derivative financial instruments such as cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps.
At the year end, the Group had outstanding foreign exchange derivatives of 41.9m, USD236.4m, CAD52.2m and CZK15.7m, outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps of 222.7m and finance leases of USD178.0m and 14.1m.
Foreign exchange and cross currency interest rate swaps are derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign currency assets.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and recycled to the Income Statement at the same time as the underlying hedged net assets affect the Income Statement.
Any material ineffectiveness is taken to the Income Statement.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant.
This would affect the Groups profit before tax and translation reserve.
The effect on the translation reserve represents the movement in the translated value of the foreign currency denominated loans and change in fair value of cross currency swap contracts.
These movements would be offset by an opposite movement in the translated value of the Groups overseas net investments.
It is estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the translation reserve of 9.1m.

It is the Groups policy to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rates on borrowings in order to provide a level of certainty to interest expense in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of interest rate fluctuations over the medium term.
To achieve the desired fixed floating ratio, the Group has entered into a series of interest rate swaps that have the effect of converting fixed rate debt to floating rate debt.
The net effect of these transactions was that as at 31 December 2016 the proportion of the Groups gross debt at floating rates was 24% 2015: 34%.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups profit before tax and on the Groups hedging reserve.
The sensitivity analysis covers all floating rate financial instruments, including the interest rate swaps.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in Sterling were increased by 100bps, it is estimated that the Groups profit before taxation would increase by approximately 0.7m.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in US Dollar were increased by 50bps, it is estimated that the Groups profit before taxation would increase by 0.1m.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments denominated in Euro were increased by 75bps, it is estimated that the Groups profit before taxation would reduce by 0.5m.
The analysis assumes that the amount and mix of floating rate debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2016.

It is the Groups policy to hedge this exposure in order to provide a level of certainty as to its cost in the short term and to reduce the year on year impact of price fluctuations over the medium term.
This is achieved by entering into fuel derivatives.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had hedged approximately 100% of its 2017 expected usage, 89% of its expected usage in 2018, 50% of its expected usage in 2019 and 10% of its expected usage in 2020 see the Group Finance Directors review for further details.
The table below demonstrates the effect of a reasonably possible variation in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant, on the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and accordingly on the Groups profit before tax and on the Groups hedging reserve.
The sensitivity analysis includes all fuel derivatives.
The effect on the hedging reserve arises through movements on the fair value of the Groups fuel derivatives.
For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 20% increase or decrease in all prices would have been 40.7m at 31 December 2016.
The figure does not include any corresponding economic advantage or disadvantage that would arise from the natural business exposure which would be expected to offset the gain or loss on the derivatives.

This risk is mitigated by a number of factors.
Many of the Groups principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts business are public or quasi-public bodies, both national DfT Rail and Network Rail in the UK and local school boards in North America, municipal authorities in Spain and Morocco, Transport for London and Centro in the UK, and regional authorities in Germany.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to pose a significant credit risk.
Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
The only elements of the Groups financial assets which are not impaired but are past due are certain trade receivable items.
An ageing of the assets which are past due is included in the following table.
In terms of trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as at the year end reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations see Risk and risk management section for details of how management manages this process.

The Group actively maintains a mixture of medium and long-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds to meet current and forecast funding requirements.
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to a range of funding sources through the banking and capital markets.
The facilities are on the same terms as the Groups existing 416m unsecured committed revolving bank facility and both mature in November 2021.
At 31 December 2016, there was nil 2015: 50m drawn down on the facilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2016 based on the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest cash flows.
As such, the amounts in this table will not agree to the carrying amounts disclosed in the Balance Sheet or other notes.
The table includes cash flows associated with derivative hedging instruments.
Their amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instrument will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately to the receive leg.

31 Financial instruments including cash, trade receivables and payables Fair values The table overleaf illustrates the fair values of all financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 31 December 2016.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases approximates to the fair value.
Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative assets that are either designated as available for sale, or are not classified as loans and receivables or held to maturity investments.
The Groups available-for-sale investments have no active market, and in the absence of any other reliable external information are carried at cost or amortised cost which approximates to the fair value.
The fair value of derivatives is either determined by the third party financial institution with which the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar financial instruments, or by use of valuation techniques using market data.
Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are classified as fair value through profit or loss and are carried on the Balance Sheet at their fair value with gains or losses recognised in the Income Statement.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the Balance Sheet at their fair value.
For cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement.
Amounts taken to Other Comprehensive Income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss or when the foreign operation is sold or partially disposed.
For fair value hedges, all gains or losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Derivatives are the only instrument which the Group holds at fair value.
The fair value measurement of these instruments is categorised within Level 2 ie the fair values are derived based on observable market inputs.
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, ie those that would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, other than the deferred contingent consideration disclosed in note 19.
There have not been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy and there are no non-recurring fair value movements.
The Groups bonds are held at a hybrid amortised cost with a fair value adjustment.
After initial recognition at fair value, the bonds are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
A portion of the bonds is designated as the hedged item in an effective fair value hedging relationship.
As such, the carrying value of this portion is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
This net carrying value will differ to the fair value depending on movements in the Groups credit risk, movements in interest rates on the un-hedged portion and unamortised fees.
All other liabilities, including finance leases, bank loans, trade and other payables and other debt payable, are held at amortised cost.
After initial fair value recognition, these instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of these liabilities approximates to the fair value.

In the financial year 2016 there was no objective evidence that would have necessitated the impairment of loans and receivables or available-for-sale assets except the provision for impairment of receivables see note 22.
Hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to market risk, such as movements in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
In line with IAS 39 the Group classifies hedges as a fair value hedges used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, b cash flow hedges used to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, and c hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
In 2016, the Group applied cash flow hedge accounting for hedging floating fuel price risks in highly probable forecast purchase transactions and for hedging net investments in US Dollar and Euro foreign operations.
The Group applied fair value hedge accounting for the fair value interest rate risk on 200m of the Groups fixed rate bonds and 78.5m Private Placement.

At 31 December 2016, the Group had designated 41.9m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives, 222.7m in cross currency interest rate swaps and 78.5m Private Placement as net investment hedges of the net assets of its Spanish subsidiaries.
Similarly, USD236.4m and CAD52.2m of synthetic debt in the form of foreign exchange derivatives were designated as a hedge of the net assets of the Groups North America subsidiaries.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in relation to these hedges.
Fuel derivatives The Group has a number of fuel derivatives in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division.
Fuel swaps are used to match the timing, type of fuel and currency in which the domestic physical fuel is purchased as closely as possible, with hedges currently in place from 2017 through to 2020.
During the year 27.0m of fair value gains 2015: 51.1m losses have been transferred to the hedging reserve due to movements in market fuel prices.
A fair value loss of 43.7m 2015: 38.6m loss has been transferred from the hedging reserve to the Income Statement following settlement of fuel trades, of which 31.7m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2016 and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.
In addition, a gain of nil was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to hedge ineffectiveness 2015: 2.5m.

These interest rate swaps all pay floating interest LIBOR a margin semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually with maturities matching the Groups Sterling bonds two swaps with total notional value of 100m mature in January 2017, two swaps with notional value of 100m mature in June 2020 and are designated as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk on 200m of these bonds.
These swaps are measured at fair value through profit or loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the Income Statement to offset any fair value gains or losses due to changes in the risk free interest rate on the swapped portion of the bonds.
As at 31 December 2016, a total fair value loss of 0.9m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these swaps.
This is offset by a fair value gain of 0.7m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in fair value on the 200m of the Groups bonds due to changes in the risk free interest rate.
In September 2012, the Group entered into two 39.25m denominated interest rate swaps equal in value to the Euro Private Placement.
These interest rate swaps all pay floating interest EURIBOR a margin semi-annually, receive fixed interest annually with maturities matching the Euro Private Placement and are designated as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk on the Private Placement.
These swaps are measured at fair value through profit and loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the Income Statement to offset any fair value gains or losses due to changes in the risk free rate on the Euro Private Placement.
As at 31 December 2016, a total fair value gain of 1.0m was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to these swaps.
This is offset by a fair value loss of 1.0m on the underlying hedged item, in this case changes in fair value of the Euro Private Placement due to changes in the risk free interest rate.

The Company defined benefit scheme also includes certain employees of the UK Coach division.
In addition, a defined contribution scheme operates for staff in the UK Bus and UK Coach divisions and the Company.
The majority of employees of the UK Rail companies are members of the appropriate shared cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
For 2016, the scheme relating to NXET Trains Limited has been recognised within assets held for sale note 11.
The Group retains the defined benefit scheme for National Express Services Limited and recognises it as a continuing asset.
The assets of the above defined benefit schemes are held separately from those of the Group and contributions to the schemes are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans.
The Group also provides certain additional unfunded post-employment benefits to employees in North America and Spain, which are disclosed in section c in the Other category.
In 2011, UK Bus agreed a 5.5m annual deficit repayment plan with the trustees of the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority Pension Fund, which continues until March 2017.
A new agreement is currently being finalised and is expected to result in a revised repayment plan of approximately 8.0m per annum.
This will fund a 104m scheme funding deficit over 14 years.
The plan remains open to accrual for existing members only.
The total pension cost charged to operating profit in the year for the continuing Group was 7.4m 2015: 8.2m, of which 3.7m 2015: 3.9m relates to the defined contribution schemes.

The UK Bus and Rail schemes hold a significant proportion of returnseeking assets equities and diversified growth funds which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The Company scheme, which holds a net surplus position and is closed to future accrual, primarily holds bonds.
Interest risk A decrease in bond interest rates will increase scheme liabilities but this will be partially offset by an increase in the returns on the scheme assets.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the schemes obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The Group has some inflation linking in its revenue streams, which helps to offset this risk.
In addition, the UK Bus schemes hold a small proportion of index-linked bonds which will help to protect against this risk and the Company scheme holds a liability driven investment portfolio which seeks to hedge against inflation.
Longevity risk The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The Company scheme is closed to future accrual, thereby reducing exposure to increases in longevity risk.
The UK Bus schemes include a buy-in policy covering part of the pensioner members liabilities, which partly helps to mitigate longevity risk Legislative risk Future legislative changes are uncertain.
In the past these have led to both increases in obligations, for example reduced investment return through the ability to reclaim Advance Corporation Tax, and decreases in obligations, for example through the ability to use CPI inflation instead of RPI to set pension increase rates.
The Company scheme is closed to future accrual, thereby reducing exposure to legislative change.
For the remaining schemes the Group receives professional advice on the impact of legislative changes.

A summary of the latest triennial actuarial valuations, and assumptions made, is as follows: UK Bus UK Rail Company Travel West Tayside Midlands 31 March 31 March 31 December 5 April Date of actuarial valuation 2014 2013 2013 2016 Actuarial method used Attained age Attained age Projected unit Projected unit Rate of investment returns per annum 3.4%-5.9% 3.5%-5.5% 5.0%-7.3% 0%-2.1% Increase in earnings per annum 4.6% 2.6% 4.2% % Scheme assets taken at market value 54.2m 448.9m 82.4m 114.8m Funding level 100% 84% 84%-100% 97% Amounts included in the Income Statement, Other Comprehensive Income and the Balance Sheet are calculated using the projected unit method.
The most recent triennial valuations are then updated by independent professionally qualified actuaries for financial reporting purposes, in accordance with IAS 19.
The main actuarial assumptions underlying the IAS 19 valuations are: 2016 2015 UK Bus UK Rail Company UK Bus UK Rail Company Rate of increase in salaries 2.5% 2.9% 2.5% 2.5% 2.6% 2.5% Rate of increase of pensions 2.4% 2.4% 3.3% 2.1% 2.1% 3.1% Discount rate 2.7% 2.7% 2.7% 3.9% 3.9% 3.9% Inflation assumption RPI 3.4% 3.4% 3.4% 3.1% 3.1% 3.1% Inflation assumption CPI 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.1% 2.1% 2.1% Post-retirement mortality in years: Current pensioners at 65 male 21.4 23.0 21.3 24.4 Current pensioners at 65 male, pension under 10,300 pa or pensionable pay under 35,000 pa 21.2 21.0 Current pensioners at 65 male others 23.6 23.4 Current pensioners at 65 female 24.2 25.8 24.1 26.9 Current pensioners at 65 female, pension under 3,700 pa or pensionable pay under 35,000 pa 23.0 22.8 Current pensioners at 65 female others 24.8 24.6 Future pensioners at 65 male 22.8 24.9 22.7 26.2 Future pensioners at 65 male, pension under 10,300 pa or pensionable pay under 35,000 pa 23.6 23.3 Future pensioners at 65 male others 25.9 25.7 Future pensioners at 65 female 25.7 27.5 25.6 28.9 Future pensioners at 65 female, pension under 3,700 pa or pensionable pay under 35,000 pa 25.4 25.2 Future pensioners at 65 female others 27.2 27.0 1 1 18 8 82 2 2 N N Na A AtT TI io IO O na N Nl E A AL L E x E pX rX e P P sR s G RE ES S rS o S G u G p P RO RO LC U U PP P A PL nLC C nu a A AN l RN e N p N U o U A rt a A LL R RE nd A E PO P cO RT co Ru T A AN nts 2 N D D A 0 AC 16C CO CUN OUTS NT S 2 2016 01 6 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 34 Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued a Summary of pension benefits and assumptions continued The demographic assumptions reflect those adopted in the most recent triennial actuarial valuation.
For the UK Rail scheme, mortality assumptions have been set by reference to the recent experience of the scheme.
Mortality is assumed to improve in the future in line with the core projection model published by the actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation, incorporating a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% pa.
The Directors regard the assumption around the discount rate to be the key assumption in the IAS 19 valuation, and the following table provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of a 0.1% change in the discount rate assumption: UK Bus Company m m Defined benefit pension liability asset at 31 December 2016 128.5 44.5 Effect of a 0.1% increase in the discount rate 10.4 2.0 Current service cost for the year ended 31 December 2016 3.5 Effect of a 0.1% increase in the discount rate 0.1 Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective Balance Sheet dates.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is determined based on market returns on each category of scheme assets.
b Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees of the UK Rail companies are members of the appropriate section of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the employee.
To date, the Group has experienced 12 changes of rail franchise ownership where the current owner has funded the scheme during the franchise term and the pension deficit at franchise exit has transferred to the new owner, without cash settlement.
By entering into the franchise contract, the TOC becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the rules of the RPS must fund its share of the pension liability in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries.
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the Groups accounts present fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows, management has consulted with TOC industry peers and has concluded that the Groups constructive obligations should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
This accounting policy, which in all other respects is consistent with that set out in this note for the Groups other defined benefit schemes, means that the Groups accounts reflect that element of the deficits anticipated to be settled by the Group during the franchise term and will prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new owner at franchise exit.
In calculating the Groups constructive obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out above.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit projected to exist at the end of the franchise and which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
The franchise adjustment which all related to National Express Essex Thameside increased from 35.6m at 31 December 2015 to 80.6m at 31 December 2016.
The principal reason for the movement was changes in financial assumptions and their impact on actuarial movements in the year.
In the prior year, the franchise adjustment increased from 30.8m at 31 December 2014 to 35.6m at 31 December 2015.
The principal reasons for the movement were increased interest and administrative expenses, partly offset by a reduction in actuarial movements.
