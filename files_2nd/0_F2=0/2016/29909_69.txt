Note 21 Financial instruments Derivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks and those that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Groups hedging policies are further described below.
Net finance cost of 53m 2015: 46m resulted from hedge ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges The Group maintains interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt issued by theGroup.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, theadjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Income Statement on an effective interest rate basis.
A gain of 45m on hedging instruments was recognised during the year, offset by a loss of 48m on hedged items 2015: a gain of 27m on hedging instruments was offset by a loss of 73m on hedged items.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses forward contracts to mainly hedge the foreign currency cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in acurrency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, fair value gains and losses aredeferred in equity.
These hedging instruments are primarily used to hedge purchases in Euros and US Dollars.
The cash flows hedged will occur and willaffectthe Group Income Statement within one year of the balance sheet date.
The Group also uses index-linked swaps to hedge cash flows on index-linked debt, interest rate swaps to hedge interest cash flows on debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge cash flows on fixed rate debt denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group also uses forward contracts to hedge the future purchase of diesel for own use.
Cash flow hedging ineffectiveness resulted in a loss of 50m during the year 2015: nil.
Net investment hedges The Group uses currency denominated borrowings to hedge the exposure of a portion of its net investment in overseas operations with non-Sterling functional currency against changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
There was nil 2015: nil that was recorded as resulting from net investment ineffectiveness.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of overseas operations.
Financial instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting The Groups policy does not permit use of derivatives for trading purposes.
However, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where gains and losses on the hedging instrument and the hedged item naturally offset in the Group Income Statement.
These instruments include index-linked swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement within finance income or costs.
