EXAMPLES In the following pages we have illustrated detailed examples for contracts for difference, spread betting and share dealing.
SELLING A CFD In this example, on day one you decide to sell a CFD for 20,000 shares in B plc assumed to be a FTSE 100 company as you expect B plcs share price to fall.
This is known as going short.
On day two the share price has indeed fallen, and you decide to close your position.
As long as your contract is open, your account will show any running profit or loss on your open CFD position not illustrated below.
You must have deposited sufficient funds to cover any running losses.
You cannot place a trade without having any money in your account.
In this example, we assume you have 1,000.
It is important to note that you can make losses in excess of your initial deposit requirement referred to as margin requirement in CFD trading, if the market moves against you.
STEP 1 DAY ONE OPENING THE POSITION The quoted bid offer price for B plc is 80.25p 80.35p.
STEP 2 SIZE SHARES BID PRICE TRADE OFFER PRICE DETAILS 80.35p 20,000 80.25p 1 INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENT B plc MID PRICE 80.30p 803.00 Expecting the market will 20,000 number of shares x 80.30p the mid-price fall, you sell at the x 5% the margin percentage BID BID PRICE 80.25p PRICE GOING SHORT 2 COMMISSION 16.05 20,000 number of shares x 80.25p the bid price x 0.10% commission When you open the position, you are required to have enough funds in your account to cover the initial margin plus commission on the trade.
In this example the margin requirement is 803.00 and the commission is 16.05, so the available funds in your account will fall from 1,000.00 to 180.95 ie .
It is important to note that the 803.00 is held as a margin requirement against the risk of the open position and will be released on the closing of the position: it is still your money but is not available for withdrawal from the account while the position is open.
STEP 3 END-OF-DAY Traditionally, clients who held long positions overnight would need to pay a funding PRICE 80.75p DAY ONE charge, while clients with short positions would receive interest if held overnight.
This charge or interest is calculated as the one-month sterling LIBOR rate - a spread.
DAILY INTEREST CHARGED However, with current market interest rates lower than the spread, clients with short positions also incur a charge.
As at 31 May 2016, the current LIBOR rate was 0.49%, while 0.89 20,000 x 80.75p x 2.01% 365 days the spread was 2.50%, resulting in a net financing charge of 2.01% for short CFD positions held overnight which for UK CFDs means those open at 10pm UK time.
A corresponding long CFD position would incur a charge of 2.99%.
1 The margin percentage and therefore margin requirement depends on the size of your CFD position and other factors such as the volatility and liquidity of the underlying share.
In this example we have used a margin requirement of 5%.
2 Commissions are variable, but for UK FTSE 100 CFDs as assumed for B plc, this was 0.10% on 31 May 2016.
168 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 INVESTOR RESOURCES STEP 4 In this example we have kept things simple and assumed no corporate actions occur.
However, we will also reflect the impact of any corporate action on the underlying share, such as a dividend or a rights issue, on your positions.
For more details, please see our website, IG.
STEP 5 DAY TWO CLOSING THE POSITION On day two, the share price has fallen and you decide to close the position.
OFFER PRICE SIZE SHARES TRADE OFFER PRICE The market has fallen you DETAILS 78.35p 78.35p 20,000 buy at the IG OFFER PRICE CLOSING POSITION 1 COMMISSION MID B plc PRICE 78.30p 15.67 20,000 x 78.35p x 0.10% BID 78.25p PRICE PROFIT PER SHARE 1.9p Difference between opening bid and closing offer prices Of course, had the market moved in the opposite direction, you would 80.25p-78.35p have made a loss of 100 for every penny the share price gained, which may have exceeded your initial margin outlay.
GROSS PROFIT ON TRADE 380.00 20,000 x 1.9p When you open your position you may STEP 6 CALCULATING THE PROFIT OR LOSS choose to add a stop.
If you choose a guaranteed stop only available for 2 ITEM CLIENT IG certain products, we guarantee that your position will be closed at this level and Selling commission Step 1 16.05 16.05 your maximum loss is therefore fixed.
There is a small charge for a guaranteed Financing charge Step 3 0.89 0.89 stop, which will be added to the margin requirement, but is only payable if the stop Buying commission Step 5 15.67 15.67 is triggered.
You may also choose to add a Gross profit Step 5 380.00 380.00 non-guaranteed stop, which will trigger a closing order when this level is breached.
2 IG hedging gain N A 380.00 Non-guaranteed stops are free, but you may not be closed at this level, particularly Net gain 347.39 32.61 if the market gaps.
1 Commissions are variable, but for UK FTSE 100 CFDs as assumed for B plc, this was 0.10% on 31 May 2016.
2 This simple example assumes IG is 100% hedged on the client trade and makes an equal and opposite gain on our broker position to the amount paid to the client.
The cost of our hedging with the broker has been ignored for simplicity.
Thus our net profit is 32.61, which is recorded in trading revenue and consists of the commission and financing charges levied on the client.
169 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 EXAMPLES CONTINUED BUYING A SPREAD BET In this example, you decide to buy A plc assumed to be a FTSE 100 company at 100 per point, as you expect that A plcs share price will rise.
This is known as going long.
Later in the day the share price has indeed risen and you decide to close your position by selling A plc at our then current bid price.
Your profit is the difference between the buying and selling prices, plus or minus any funding charges or other costs discussed in Steps 3 and 5.
As long as your bet is open, your account will show any running profit or loss on your open position not illustrated below.
You cannot place a bet without having any money in your account.
It is important to note that you can make losses in excess of your initial deposit, if the market moves against you.
STEP 1 OPENING THE POSITION A plc is trading in the market at 144.5p 144.7p and our quote for A plc on a daily funded bet is 144.3p 144.9p.
You decide to buy 100 per point at 144.9p, our offer price.
In this example one point represents a 1p movement in the underlying share price, so your 100 per point bet is equivalent to buying 10,000 shares in A plc.
Expecting the market will OFFER PRICE SIZE PER POINT rise, you open the bet at the BET IG OFFER 144.9p OFFER PRICE PRICE DETAILS 144.9p 100.00 GOING LONG 1 INITIAL DEPOSIT REQUIREMENT UNDERLYING A plc SHARE PRICE 144.5p 144.7p 723.00 100.00 bet size x 144.6p the mid-price x 5% the deposit factor IG BID 144.3p PRICE 2 SPREAD 20.00 Difference between the market price and our quote 144.9p-144.7p x 100.00 per point STEP 2 When you open the position, you are required to have the initial 723 deposit requirement in your account.
The available funds in your account will therefore fall from 1,000 to 277 ie 1,000-723.
The available funds remaining in your account need to be enough to cover any running losses you may incur, or you run the risk of being closed out of the bet.
It is important to note that the 723 is held as a deposit against the risk of the open position and will be released on the closing of the position: it is still your money but is not available for withdrawal from the account while the position is open.
At this stage you may choose to add a stop to your position.
If you choose a guaranteed stop only available for certain products, we guarantee that your position will be closed at this level and your maximum loss is therefore fixed.
When you have a guaranteed stop attached to your trade position, we apply a small fee only if the stop is triggered.
You may also choose to add a non-guaranteed stop, which will trigger a closing order when this level is breached.
Non-guaranteed stops are completely free, but you may not be closed at this level, particularly if the market gaps.
1 The deposit factor and therefore deposit requirement depends on your account type and other factors such as the volatility and liquidity of the underlying share.
2 Our dealing spread varies depending on the market and asset class traded and can be variable, especially in volatile market conditions.
For examples please see our website, IG.
170 IG Group Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 INVESTOR RESOURCES STEP 3 In this example we have kept things simple and assumed no corporate actions occur.
STEP 4 CLOSING THE POSITION Later that day, the A plc share price has indeed risen and you decide to close the position, realising your profit on the bet.
At this point A plc is trading in the market at 148.6p 148.8p and our daily quote is 148.4p 149.0p.
BID PRICE SIZE PER POINT BET IG OFFER DETAILS 148.4p 100.00 149.0p PRICE GROSS PROFIT A plc UNDERLYING SHARE PRICE 390.00 148.6p 148.8p Calculated as the market price movement of the share 148.6p-144.7p x 100.00 per point IG BID The market has risen 148.4p PRICE you sell at the IG BID PRICE SPREAD CLOSING POSITION 20.00 Calculated at 148.6p-148.4p x 100.00 per point Of course, had the market moved in the opposite direction, you would have made a loss of 100 for every penny the share price fell, which may have exceeded your initial deposit.
STEP 5 CALCULATING THE PROFIT OR LOSS For many markets eg index futures, we build funding charges into the quote price.
For share daily funded bets we make funding adjustments each day at 10pm.
We apply funding at the rate of one-month LIBOR - a spread generally 2.5%.
In the example above, if the bet had remained 1 ITEM CLIENT IG open at 10pm, and assuming one-month LIBOR of 0.49%, a funding charge of 1.23 Buying spread Step 1 20.00 20.00 would have been applied against the client account and recorded as revenue for IG Selling spread Step 4 20.00 20.00 calculated as 100 x 150.0p assumed end-of-day price x 2.99% 365 1.23.

You have linked your share dealing account to your CFD account so you have access to IGs collateral feature.
After a few months, the share price has risen and you decide to close your position by selling A plc at the current bid price.
Your profit is the difference between the buying and selling prices, plus any dividends and minus any commission or other costs discussed in Steps 2 and 5.
It is important to note that the value of shares, ETFs and ETCs bought through any stockbroking or stocks and shares ISA account can fall as well as rise, which could mean getting back less than you originally deposited.
STEP 1 - PRICE DISCOVERY Most traditional stockbrokers only provide a request for quote or at quote service that delivers a fixed price, which is only valid for a short period of time.
With us, you can trade at quote or on exchange, allowing you to interact directly with the order book in the underlying market.
Dealing on exchange offers you live visibility of prices and full market depth allowing you to make an informed decision.
Choose between at quote or on exchange to execute your order at the best available price.
If you place an on exchange order we use our Smart Order Router SOR to seek out the best price and size available.
Our SOR searches for liquidity across multiple venues, starting with dark pools that offer mid-point matching the best possible chance of getting price improvements.
If there is no improvement available on dark venues the SOR goes to a market maker, again looking for size or price improvements.
Finally, if neither of the above sources provides price or size improvements, SOR sends orders to lit venues, where they will be visible on an exchange.
At quote On exchange A PLC Interact with market makers 1,000 shares Interact directly with order book Place order in the book Get fixed price by RSP Order to buy Fixed price: 777p SOR looks for the best available price at execution Potential price improvement SOR looks for the best available SOR looks for the best available price - venue 1 price - venue 2 775p 778p STEP 2 EXECUTING YOUR TRADE Once you have decided whether you would like to deal at quote or on exchange, you can place your trade directly from your platform.
Once the appropriate price has been identified, your trade is executed.
When you buy your shares you are required to have sufficient funds on your account to make the purchase and cover the cost of commission, as well as currency conversion fees if the share is priced in a foreign currency.
In this example, we assume you have also 1 been active on your CFD account, which means you automatically qualify for our lowest commission rate, which is 5.
The available funds in your account will therefore fall by the value of the shares you have bought plus the commission.
In this example, you purchase 100 shares priced at 775GBp the best available price, which will reduce your cash balance to 220 i. e. 1000 775 5.
Unlike our margined products, you own your shares outright, meaning that you do not need to make any additional payments to maintain your stockbroking position.

The collateral service allows you to use up to 95% of 2 the value of your shareholdings as initial margin against your spread bets or CFD positions.
In this example, we assume that you have a position on your CFD account in B plc, another FTSE 100 listed company, which has a margin requirement of 300.
The fact that you 2 are holding the physical shares in A plc, and have linked your accounts for collateral means that you can use up to 95% of the value of this position that is, 775 x 95% 736 to cover your margin requirement on B plc.
This will free up any additional funds on your CFD account, which you can then use to open further CFD positions or as a buffer against adverse market movements.
It is important to note that the collateral value is real-time.
This means the collateral value of your assets will fluctuate according to movements in the price of the stock s you hold on your stockbroking account.
3 Your shareholdings remain intact and retain their full value: you simply use a percentage of their value as collateral to fund shorter-term trades.
Importantly, you can only use your shareholdings to cover the initial margin on your spread bets or CFDs.
Any running losses will need to be covered by the available cash in your CFD account.
STEP 4 CORPORATE ACTIONS In this example we have kept things simple and assumed no corporate actions occur.
However, as the owner of the equity we will also reflect the impact of any other corporate actions on your shares, such as a rights issue, on your positions.
STEP 5 SELLING YOUR SHARES As the objectives of your portfolio change, you can divest all or parts of your shareholding using our superior execution technology.
Once your sale is confirmed, your account will be credited with the equivalent cash.
As before, we assume that you qualify for our lowest commission rate as a holder of active stockbroking and margined accounts, so the commission is 6.
If the price of your shares in A plc has risen from 775p to 846p, your account balance will rise to 1,060 i. e. 219 846 - 5.
STEP 6 TRANSPARENT TRADING As well as buying new shares you can conveniently keep your shares portfolio in one place, by transferring in your existing shareholdings to us, free from IG charges.
Once your shares are transferred you will have access to the full range of features on IGs platform including our collateral service and our superior execution.
You will also have access to our range of over 9,000 international shares, which are offered in their local denomination, regardless of the currency on your account.
This means youll know exactly what youre paying, with our fee of just 0.3% to convert to your base currency.
Obtaining live prices for international stocks from an exchange can incur a monthly fee, but we will refund this charge in full if you place a minimum number of trades in the previous month.
However, unlike some other stockbrokers, this is the only other fee besides commission we will charge you, meaning you are only charged when you trade and not just for holding your portfolio.
SIZE SHARES BID PRICE TRADITIONAL TRADE STOCKBROKER 852p DETAILS 100 OFFER PRICE 846p IG OFFER COMMISSION 850p PRICE The market has risen 5.00 IG BID PRICE you sell at the IG BID PRICE 846p PROFIT PER SHARE CLOSING POSITION TRADITIONAL 71p STOCKBROKER 844p Difference between opening offer price and closing bid price BID PRICE 846p - 775p GROSS PROFIT ON TRADE 71.00 1 Commissions are variable, but if your share dealing account is accessible under the same login as your active spread betting or CFD account, you automatically qualify for our lowest commission rate by placing at least one spread bet or CFD trade in the previous calendar month.
2 Generally you can use 75% - 95% of the value of your portfolio as collateral, depending on the liquidity of shareholdings.
3 We do all we can to make sure you have the opportunity to cover any realised spread betting or CFD losses with cash.
If you do not deposit additional funds to cover a losing leveraged trade, we will follow our normal process of closing the trade and informing you that your account is in debit.
We will only take control of your shares if your account remains in debit.
