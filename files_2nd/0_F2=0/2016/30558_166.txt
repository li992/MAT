No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
In previous years, fully depreciated assets have been retained in the Companys fixed asset register and included in the table above.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Companys annual depreciation charge, these assets have been removed from both cost and accumulated depreciation brought forward and in the current year.
Included in the note above is an amount of 843m 2015: 884m relating to non-depreciable land and 6m 2015: 13m of assets under construction.
The cost of assets held under finance leases at 31 January 2016 is 353m 2015: 322m, with related accumulated depreciation of 143m 2015: 123m.
The cost of financing asset developments prior to them being ready for use has been included in the cost of the project.
The cumulative amount of interest capitalised in the total cost above amounts to 73m 2015: 73m.
Interest is capitalised at the effective interest rate of 5% 2015: 5% incurred on borrowings.
The Company considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Company calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised.
The methodology applied by the Company is the same methodology as applied by the Group, see note 3.3 for further details.
