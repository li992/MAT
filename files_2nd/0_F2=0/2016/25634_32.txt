JIB Group Ltd is incorporated in the UK.
During the year dividends of 88,000,000 2015: 106,000,000 were received from JIB Group Ltd.
The company owns 100% of the ordinary share capital of JLT Lixin Insurance Brokers Co. Limited incorporated in China 2015: 100%.

f. Accounting for the Employee Share Trust During the year the Company has undertaken a review of the legal structure of its Employee Share Trust EST.
The EST is controlled by the Company and is included in the consolidated accounts of the Group.
The purchase of shares by the EST is funded by JIB Group Limited and a recharge mechanism is operated between the company and its subsidiaries to recover the cash paid by JIB Group Limited, as a result no cash transactions go through the company directly.
Following the review of the Group's UK subsidiaries accounting for the transition to FRS101, it was concluded that the most appropriate treatment was that the company is the ultimate Group entity responsible for the settlement of the share options under the various option schemes currently in place.
As a result, the purchase of shares by the EST and the recharge recovery operated by JIB Group Limited should be recognised in the company's financial statements.
The financial transactions in respect of the EST were previously recognised in JIB Group Limited.
The EST transactions mainly consist of three main transactions: 1 the purchase of shares by the EST results in the recognition of treasury shares reducing the reserves and crediting the amounts due to Group undertakings, 2 the recognition of an additional capital contribution to the subsidiaries equating to the equity settled share-based payment charge for the year results in an increase of the investment in subsidiaries and an increase in reserves, 3 the recharges from the Company to the subsidiaries, which are directly linked to the equity settled share-based payment charge, result in a reduction of the capital contribution investment in subsidiaries and an increase in the amounts due from Group undertakings.
