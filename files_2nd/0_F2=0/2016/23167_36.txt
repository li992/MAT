Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP was approved by the Board in 2006 enabling the Group to award shares to particular individuals, normally in the form of nominal cost options.
The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee.
One grant was made in the period, to the Executive Directors and senior management.
These grants are exercisable in December 2018, dependent on the level of growth in Group EPS relative to RPI, as well as continuing employment.
The maximum life of options under the LTIP is ten years from the date of grant.
Full details of this plan are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 77.
The fair value of options granted during the period was determined using the BlackScholes valuation model.
The significant inputs into the model are detailed below.
The volatility is measured at the standard deviation of share returns based on the daily share price over the twenty days prior to the grant date.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: December October October October 2015 2015 2014 2013 Share price at date of grant 986.5p 942.5p 816.0p 876.5p Volatility 31.31% 31.90% 35.11% 40.00% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk-free interest rate 1.10% 1.00% 1.44% 1.35% Discount factor, based on dividend yield to vesting date 0.670 0.670 0.670 0.670 Fair value of option 661.1p 631.6p 546.8p 587.4p dunelm.
