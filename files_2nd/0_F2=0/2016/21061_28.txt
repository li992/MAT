Vivergo Fuels is based in the UK and isincluded in the Sugar segment.
The impairment was a consequence of the continuing fall in crude oil and bioethanol prices andthe further weakening of the euro against sterling, both of which affected the groups assessment of the recoverability oftheshareholder loans.

The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of exceptional items, profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and the sale and closure of businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles and any associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.

Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs, or groups of CGUs, thatare expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows: 2016 2015 CGU or group of CGUs Primary reporting segment Discount rate m m ACH Grocery 9.8% 292 248 AB Mauri Ingredients 12.1% 308 268 Twinings Ovaltine Grocery 9.5% 119 119 Capullo Grocery 13.4% 46 58 Illovo Sugar 18.3% 114 102 AB World Foods Grocery 10.8% 78 78 Other not individually significant Various Various 263 240 1,220 1,113 Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 117 8.
Intangible assets continued A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently ifevents or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying value of goodwill is assessed by reference to its value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs.
These projections are based on the most recent budget, which has been approved by the board and reflects managements expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources of information.
Long-term growth rates for periods not covered by the annual budget reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU, or group of CGUs, operate.
For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region.
In these circumstances, budgeted cash flows are extended, generally to between three and five years, using specific growth assumptions and taking into account the specific business risks.
The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country, industry and market risk.
The growth rates to perpetuity beyond the initial budgeted cash flows, applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill, were in a range between 0% and 4%, consistent with the inflation factors included in the discount rates applied 2015 between 0% and 4%.
Changes in volumes, selling prices and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates.
Each of the groups CGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review.
Notwithstanding a further substantial improvement in profit in the current year, AB Mauri continued to experience competitive pricing pressure in a number of markets around the world as well as challenging macroeconomic conditions in some markets, including high inflation rates and currency devaluations.
Accordingly, management has again undertaken an impairment review.
Detailed forecasts for a period of ten years to reflect the time required for completion of the dry yeast production strategy were prepared and management concluded that the assets were not impaired.
Key drivers of the forecast improvement in performance include achievement of price increases in high inflation environments, improved reach and competitiveness in the global dry yeast market, implementation of a number of margin improvement initiatives, particularly in cost reduction, and continuing growth in the global bakery ingredients business.
Headroom was $551m on a CGU carrying value of $911m 2015 headroom of $190m ona CGU carrying value of $947m.
The geographic diversity and varying local economic environments of AB Mauris operations mean thatthe critical assumptions underlying the detailed forecasts used in the impairment model are wide ranging.
It is therefore impractical to provide meaningful sensitivities to these assumptions other than the discount rate.
The discount rate used was 12.1% 2015 14.7% and would have to increase to more than 17.0% 2015 16.7% before value in use fell below the CGU carrying value.
Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2%3% 2015 2%3% per annum dependent on location.
For all goodwill other than AB Mauri, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions onwhich it has determined value in use would cause carrying values to materially exceed value in use.

Property, plant and equipment continued Impairment The methodology used to assess property, plant and equipment for impairment is the same as that described for impairment assessments of goodwill.
See note 8 for further details.
An impairment of A$150m 98m was recorded in 2012 in the Australian meat business.
Further progress was made inthe current year with volume growth, a focus on higher margin products, further reduction in manufacturing costs and improving efficiency.
Following a detailed assessment, management has concluded that the carrying value oftheassets in the meat business is not further impaired.
Headroom was A$78m on a CGU carrying value of A$273m 2015 headroom of A$30m on a CGU carrying value of A$284m.
Estimatesof long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 2.0% 2015 2.0% per annum.
A sensitivity of plus or minus 1% applied to volume assumptions after 2017 impacts headroom by plus or minus A$65m.
Low bread prices and strong continuing competition in the UK bakery sector led to low profitability at Allied Bakeries and resulted in the need for an assessment of impairment.
Headroom was 43m on a CGU carrying value of 281m 2015 headroom of 27m on a CGU carrying value of 294m.
Estimates of long-term growth rates beyond the forecast periods were 0.4%.
A sensitivity of plus or minus 1% applied to bread prices impacts headroom by plus or minus 25m.

Employee entitlements The group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes in the UK and overseas.
Thedefined benefit schemes expose the group to a variety of actuarial risks including demographic assumptions such as mortality and financial assumptions such as discount rate, inflation risk and market investment risk.
The group is not exposed toany unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks.
All schemes comply with local legislative requirements.
UK defined benefit scheme The groups principal UK defined benefit scheme is the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new members.
Defined contribution arrangements are in place for other employees.
The UK defined benefit schemes represent 91% 2015 92% of the groups defined benefit scheme assets and 88% 2015 89% of defined benefit scheme liabilities.
The Scheme is governed by a trustee board which is independent of the group and which agrees aschedule of contributions with the Company each time a formal funding valuation is performed.
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2014, using the current unit method, andrevealed a surplus of 79m.
The market value of Scheme assets was 3,085m, representing 103% of members accrued benefits after allowing for expected future salary increases.
The Schemes assets are managed using a risk-controlled investment strategy, which includes a liability-driven investment policy that seeks to match, where appropriate, the profile of the liabilities.
This includes the use of derivative instruments to hedge inflation, interest and foreign exchange risks.
The Scheme utilises both market and solvency triggers to develop the level ofhedges in place.
To date, the Scheme is fully hedged for 48% of inflation sensitivity and 21% of interest rate risk.
It is intendedtohedge 80% of totalexposure.
The Scheme is forbidden by the trust deed from holding direct investments in the equity of the Company, although it is possible that the Scheme may hold indirect interests through investments in some equity funds.
The Scheme owned the freehold of anoffice building in London which was leased to the group at an open market rent.
The property was sold during the year.
Thefair value of this building in 2015 was 7m.
Overseas defined benefit schemes The group also operates defined benefit retirement schemes in a number of overseas businesses, which are primarily funded final salary schemes, as well as a small number of unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes, which are accounted forin the same way as defined benefit retirement schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the charge was 36m in the UK and 38m overseas, totalling 74m 2015 UK 36m, overseas 40m, total 76m.
Actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions for the groups defined benefit schemes at the year end were: 2016 2016 2015 2015 UK Overseas UK Overseas % % % % Discount rate 2.5 0.216.2 3.8 0.916.3 Inflation 2.13.1 09.2 2.83.3 07.4 Rate of increase in salaries 3.1 012.0 3.8 012.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.22.9 06.5 2.33.1 04.5 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.1 02.0 2.42.8 02.0 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK defined benefit schemes in both years are derived from the S2 mortality tables with improvements in line with the 2015 projection model 2015 2013 projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating for males and a 0.7-year rating down for females, both with a long-term trend of 1.25% 2015 1.5%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies in the UK defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2016 2015 Life expectancy from age 65 in years Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2016 2015 22.2 24.8 22.7 25.4 Member aged 65 in 2036 2035 23.9 26.7 25.0 27.7 An allowance has been made for cash commutation in line with emerging scheme experience.
Other demographic assumptions for the UK defined benefit schemes are set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
Theassumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic funding valuation of the schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions for mortality, financial and demographic factors have been used.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 121 11.
Employee entitlements continued A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure UK defined benefit scheme liabilities at 17 September 2016 is: Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate decrease increase by 0.5% increase decrease by 10.2% Inflation increase decrease by 0.5% increase decrease by 8.9% Rate of increase in salaries increase decrease by 0.5% increase decrease by 2.0% Rate of mortality reduce by one year increase by 3.4% A sensitivity to the rate of increase in pensions in payment and pensions in deferment is represented by the inflation sensitivity, as all pensions increases and deferred revaluations are linked to inflation.
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the period and may not be representative of the actual change.
It is based on a change in the specific assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivities, the same method used to calculate scheme liabilities recognised in the balance sheet has been applied.
The method and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis have not changed since the prior year.

For financial reporting in the groups accounts, liabilities are assessed by actuaries using the projected unit method.
The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis, mainly due to different assumptions used to projectscheme liabilities.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities comprise 30% 2015 28% in respect of active participants, 24% 2015 23% for deferred participants and 46% 2015 49% for pensioners.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit scheme liabilities at the end of the year is 20 years for both UK and overseas schemes 2015 18 years for both UK and overseas schemes.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions 2016 During the year the group acquired two small European Agriculture businesses which, together, increased net assets by 8msatisfied in cash.
Pre-acquisition carrying amounts were the same as recognised values on acquisition apart from a 2m non-operating intangible asset recognised in respect of brands.
The acquisitions contributed aggregate revenues of 13m and noadjusted profit before tax for the period between the dates of acquisition and 17 September 2016.
Aggregate contributions torevenue and adjusted profit before tax, had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period, have not been disclosed asappropriate financial information, prepared under Adopted IFRS, is not available.
The 8m of cash consideration differs by 2m from the cash outflow of 10m on the purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in the cash flow statement.
The difference comprises payment of deferred consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions.
In June 2016, the group paid 252m, including costs, to acquire the minority shareholding in Illovo Sugar Limited.
As Illovo and its subsidiaries have been consolidated in the group financial statements since the acquisition of the original controlling interest in 2006, this was treated as a transaction with owners and recorded in equity rather than as an acquisition.
The cash flow is shown within financing activities.
2015 Acquisitions had the following effect on the groups assets and liabilities: Pre-acquisition Recognised carrying values on values acquisition m m Net assets Intangible assets 32 53 Property, plant and equipment 4 4 Inventories 10 10 Trade and other receivables 18 18 Cash and cash equivalents 8 8 Trade and other payables 38 40 Loan interest 48 3 Overdrafts 3 3 Loans 323 18 Taxation 82 20 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 258 49 Goodwill 5 Non-controlling interests 1 Total consideration 55 Satisfied by Cash consideration 57 Deferred consideration 6 Interest in joint venture 8 55 Net cash Cash consideration 57 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 8 Overdrafts acquired 3 52 In October 2014, the group acquired Dorset Cereals in the UK for gross cash consideration of 68m, but with cash acquired of 8m.
Non-operating intangible assets of 21m in respect of brand and customer relationships together with the related deferred tax were recognised as fair value adjustments.
In May 2015, the group acquired BPs 47% interest in Vivergo Fuels in the UK, in which the group already held an equity-accounted joint venture interest of 47%.
Fair value adjustments comprised the valuation of shareholder loan obligations and associated interest accruals together with the related tax consequences.
A non-cash charge of 75m was recorded in line with accounting requirements to remeasure the groups interest at fair value prior to the acquisition.
This was charged to loss on sale and closure of business.
The acquisitions contributed aggregate revenues of 81m and an adjusted loss before tax of 1m for the period between thedates of acquisition and 12 September 2015.
Aggregate contributions to revenue and adjusted profit before tax, had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period, were not disclosed as appropriate financial information, prepared under Adopted IFRS, was not available.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 129 22.
Acquisitions and disposals continued Disposals 2016 The group closed a small number of Ingredients businesses during the year, incurring closure costs of 4m in the Asia Pacific segment and 1m in Europe & Africa.
The group also charged a 9m onerous lease provision to sale and closure of business inthe Central segment as a result of lease reversions following the administration of the BHS retail chain in the UK.
2015 The group sold and closed businesses which had the following impact on adjusted operating profit by segment: United Europe The Kingdom & Africa Americas Asia Pacific Total m m m m m Sugar North China 100 100 Vivergo Fuels 75 75 Other including warranties 4 11 1 6 75 4 11 99 181 Grocery warranties 6 6 Agriculture warranties 3 3 66 4 11 99 172 The group sold the Yian and BoCheng beet sugar factories in Heilongjiang province in north China and restructured the associated head office in Beijing.
This reduced the groups assets and liabilities as follows: m Net assets Intangible assets 9 Property, plant and equipment 47 Inventories 3 Trade and other payables 1 Loans 1 Taxation 5 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 62 Goodwill 46 Non-controlling interests 2 Recycle of effect of movements in foreign exchange 8 Profits less losses on sale and closure of businesses 100 Total consideration 2 Satisfied by Cash consideration 3 Provisions made 5 2 Net cash Cash consideration 3 The group incurred a net 75m non-cash charge arising on the acquisition of BPs 47% interest in Vivergo Fuels.
Accounting standards required the remeasurement of the groups interest at fair value prior to the acquisition, resulting in a loss on the deemed disposal of the groups original interest prior to its immediate re-acquisition at fair value.
Also in the Sugar segment, an intangible asset with a carrying value of 11m was written off on closure of a small business inNorth America.
14m of warranty provisions relating to disposals made in previous years were no longer required and were released during theyear.
These comprised 6m in Grocery all in the UK, 5m in Sugar 4m in Europe & Africa and 1m in Asia Pacific and 3m inAgriculture all in the UK.
The cash consideration received for the disposal was 3m which compared with a cash inflow of 5m on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement.
The difference related to deferred consideration received in respect of prior year disposals.

Share-based payments The group had the following principal equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 the Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003.
Ittakes the form of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over a three-year performance period.
The Share Incentive Plan expired in December 2013, with the last grantof allocations made in November 2013.
Conditional shares allocated under the Share Incentive Plan will vest under theterms of that plan.
Associated British Foods Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP The LTIP was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 6 December 2013.
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied, typically over athree-year performance period.
Further information regarding the operation of the above plans can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 69 to 87.
Total conditional allocations under the groups equity-settled share-based payment plans are as follows: Balance Balance outstanding at outstanding the beginning Granted Expired at the end of the year awarded Vested lapsed of the year 2016 3,330,356 849,566 626,879 872,096 2,680,947 2015 4,365,341 911,832 1,572,229 374,588 3,330,356 Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust Ordinary shares subject to allocation under the groups equity-settled share-based payment plans are held in a separate Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust.
The Trust is funded by the Company.
Voting rights attached to shares held by the Trustare exercisable by the trustee, who is entitled to consider any recommendation made by a committee of the Company.
At17September 2016 the Trust held 1,513,339 2015 1,490,218 ordinary shares of the Company.
The market value of these shares at the year end was 41m 2015 46m.
The Trust has waived its right to dividends.
Movements in the year were releases of 626,879 shares and purchases of 650,000 shares 2015 releases of 1,572,229 shares.
Fair values The weighted average fair value of conditional grants made was determined by taking the market price of the shares at the time of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of the conditional shares allocated during the year was 3,185 pence 2015 2,873 pence and the weighted average share price was 3,425 pence 2015 3,089 pence.
The dividend yield used was 2.5%.

Financial instruments continued The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Financial asset liability Fair value determination Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, other Fair values have been stated at book values due to short maturities receivables and accrued income, trade payables, other orotherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
payables and accruals Other non-current investments recorded within These comprise minority shareholdings in privately owned, unquoted othernon-current receivables companies where there is no active market available to value them.
Wherethe fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Other non-current receivables, loans and overdrafts Fair values for these level 2 financial instruments have been estimated and finance leases bydiscounting expected future cashflows see below.
Derivatives Fair values are typically determined either by reference to third-party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable marketprices.
The groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is almost always available to assist with the valuation ofderivatives.
Deferred consideration Deferred consideration is measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, discounted to present value where material.
Fair value is therefore equivalent to book value.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments and derivatives.
The group classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and subjective judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements: Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments.
An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted market price.
Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. market prices and rates or indirectly i. e. derived from market prices and rates.
An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, where forward exchange rates and yield curve data, which are observable in the market, are used to derive fair value.
Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.
b Derivatives All derivatives are classified as current on the face of the balance sheet.
The table below analyses the carrying amount of derivatives and their contractual notional amounts, together with an analysis of derivatives by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which their fair value measurement method is categorised.

d Financial risk identification and management The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments: market risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in many locations around the world.
These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
Trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures and, where appropriate, options.
These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executivemanagement.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
Treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
The groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.

Financial instruments continued e Foreign currency translation The group presents its financial statements in sterling.
As a result of its worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings and, where they are not insterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges.
This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement otherthan via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings.
The group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21.
The effect of thedesignation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted fordirectly within other comprehensive income.
At year end, the group had $160m of borrowings 2015 $280m that were designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in US dollars.
A net foreign exchange loss of 26m 2015 loss of 7m on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders.
The group also held currency forwards and cross currency swaps that have been designated as hedges of its net investments in Australian dollars and euros, whose change in fairvalue of 46m has been debited to the translation reserve, all of which was attributable to equity shareholders 2015 29m credited to the translation reserve.
f Market risk Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way tomeet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, since they are both entered into, and continue to beheld, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, but some are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting can be satisfied.
This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure.
These instruments are classified as held for trading andaremarked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group does not have significant sensitivities in respect of the accounting for its on-balance sheet commodity contracts.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 135 25.
Financial instruments continued ii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates.
Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments: and interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates.
Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
The groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk.
At 17 September 2016, 625m 70% 2015 636m and 71% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest, the majority ofwhich is the US private placement loans of 588m 2015 601m.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates e. g. LIBOR.
The group does not have significant sensitivities to the impact of interest rates on derivative valuations, nor to the impact of interest rates on floating rate borrowings.
iii Foreign currency risk The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is exposed to movements inforeign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
The group also publishes its financial statements insterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e on page 134.
Transaction risk Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
The groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance.
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements inexchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12-month basis.
The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either tothe income statement or to the non-financial assetacquired.
The majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: sugar prices in British Sugar to movements in the sterling euro exchange rate: sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies.

A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see opposite page for a separate sensitivity.
This sensitivity is presented before taxation andnon-controlling interests.

The groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fairvalue by counterparty at 17 September 2016.
The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2016 2015 Note m m Cash and cash equivalents 581 702 Loans and receivables 25a 1,206 1,043 Derivative assets at fair value through profit and loss 14 3 Derivative assets in designated net investment hedging relationships 1 33 Derivative assets in designated cash flow hedging relationships 90 38 1,892 1,819 The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Trade and other receivables Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
The group has an established credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
Credit limits are established for allsignificant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
Customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have asecured claim.
The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.

Cash and cash equivalents Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot beused, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury.
The group has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Other financial assets Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging or net investment hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.
