Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as results of operating activities before depreciation and amortisation, finance costs, share-based payment expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on disposals of assets and fair value gains and losses on share consideration payable.

It is also adjusted for exceptional or non-recurring items which are defined as items of income and expense of such size, nature or incidence that, in the view of management, are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and should be disclosed to explain the performance of the Group.
In the current and prior year, these exceptional, non-recurring items include acquisition and restructuring costs, largely relating to the transformational acquisition of the Skrill Group in August 2015 Note 25.
