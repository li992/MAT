JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 104 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies General information JRP Group plc the Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 13 June 2013 as a public company limited by shares.
The Companys registered office is Vale House, Roebuck Close, Bancroft Road, Reigate, Surrey, RH2 7RU.
As explained in note 2, on 4 April 2016, Just Retirement Group plc JRG and Partnership Assurance Group plc PAG completed an all-share transaction to create JRP Group plc JRP.
This has been accounted for as a business combination in which JRG has acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of PAG through a share-for-share exchange, with effective control passing on 1 April 2016.
JRG changed its name to JRP Group plc on 4 April 2016.
In May 2016 JRP changed its accounting reference date from 30 June to 31 December.
As such, these financial statements comprise the Consolidated financial statements of JRP Group plc formerly Just Retirement Group plc and its subsidiaries, together referred to as the Group, as at, and for the 18 month period ended, 31 December 2016.
1.1 Basis of preparation The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union effective for accounting periods commencing on or before 1 July 2015 and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Values are expressed to the nearest 0.1m.
The following new accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to existing accounting standards in issue, but either not yet effective or endorsed by the EU, have not been early adopted by the Group.
Unless stated, the new and amended standards and interpretations are being assessed but are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRS 9, Financial instruments effective 1 January 2018 and amendment to IFRS 4, Insurance contracts effective 1 January 2018, not yet endorsed.
IFRS 9 includes comprehensive requirements relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
In 2016 the IASB amended IFRS 4, the existing Insurance Contracts standard, to allow entities that issue insurance contracts to defer application of IFRS 9 until accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.
This is intended to align with the expected effective date of IFRS 17, the forthcoming Insurance Contracts standard.
This option, which the Group intends to adopt, is subject to meeting criteria relating to the predominance of insurance activity.
It is expected that the amendment of the insurance standard will have a significant impact on the presentation of future cash flows within the financial statements, which will be formally assessed once the standard has been finalised.
IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers effective 1 January 2017, not yet fully endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 15 specifies how and when an entity recognises revenue, providing a single, principles-based model to be applied to all contracts with customers, whilst requiring more informative and relevant disclosures.
Insurance contracts, although contracts with customers, are outside the scope of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16, Leases effective 1 January 2019, not yet endorsed.
IFRS 16 specifies how to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard provides a single accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for leases unless the term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value.
The effect of applying this standard will be to bring the operating leases disclosed in note 32 onto the balance sheet.
Amendments to IAS 1, Disclosure initiative effective 1 January 2016, not yet endorsed.
The amendments clarify guidance on materiality and aggregation, the presentation of subtotals, the structure of financial statements and the disclosure of accounting policies.
Amendment to IAS 12, Income taxes effective 1 January 2017, not yet endorsed.
The amendments clarify the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments, and provide guidance on estimates for future taxable profits and the assessment of multiple deferred tax assets in combination.
Amendment to IAS 7, Statement of cash flows effective 1 January 2017, not yet endorsed.
The amendments require additional disclosures that will allow users to understand changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes arising from cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings, and non-cash changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 105 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.2 Significant accounting policies and the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The major areas of judgement used as part of accounting policy application are summarisedbelow.
Accounting policy Item involving judgement Critical accounting judgement 1.6 Classification of insurance and Assessment of significance of insurance risk transferred.
investment contracts 1.19 Financial investments Classification of financial investments, including assessment of market observability of valuation inputs.
All estimates are based on managements knowledge of current facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge and predictions of future events and actions.
Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates.
The table below sets out those items the Group considers susceptible to changes in critical estimates and assumptions together with the relevant accountingpolicy.
Accounting policy and notes Item involving estimates and assumptions Critical estimates and assumptions 1.18, 16 a and d Measurement of fair value of loans The critical estimates used in valuing loans secured by residential secured by residential mortgages mortgages include the projected future receipts of interest and loan repayments, future house prices, and the future costs of administering the loanportfolio.
The key assumptions used as part of the valuation calculation include future property prices and their volatility, mortality, the rate of voluntary redemptions and the liquidity premium added to the riskfree curve and used to discount the mortgage cash flows.
Further details can be found in note 16 a.
1.19, 22 Measurement of reinsurance The critical estimates used in measuring the value of reinsurance assets arising from reinsurance assets include the projected future cash flows arising from reinsurers arrangements share of the Groups insurance liabilities.
The key assumptions used in the valuation include discount rates and mortality experience, as described below, and assumptions around the reinsurers ability to meet its claim obligations.
1.22, 22 b, 23 b Measurement of insurance The critical estimates used in measuring insurance liabilities include liabilitiesarising from writing the projected future Retirement Income payments and the cost of Retirement Income insurance administering payments to policyholders.
contracts The key assumptions are the discount rates and mortality experience used in the valuation of future Retirement Income payments.
The valuation discount rates are derived from yields on supporting assets after deducting allowances for default.
Mortality assumptions are derived from the appropriate standard mortality tables, adjusted to reflect the future expected mortality experience of the policyholders.
Further detail can be found in notes 22 and 23.
1.3, 2 Fair values of Partnership Assurance The key assumptions for the valuation of the acquired in-force Group on acquisition business are the projected profits of the acquired business and the discount rate.
The discount rate used represents a weighted average cost of capital determined using a capital asset pricing model CAPM approach.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 106 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.3 Consolidation principles The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those investees over which the Group has control.
The Group has control over an investee if all of the following are met: 1 it has power over the investee: 2 it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 3 it has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its own returns.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from consolidation from the date on which control ceases.
All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with Group policies.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Under this method, the cost of acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration at date of acquisition and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
The excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised asgoodwill.
The Group uses the equity method to consolidate its investments in joint ventures and associates.
Under the equity method of accounting the investment is initially recognised at fair value and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets of the joint ventures and associates.
1.4 Segments The Groups segmental results are presented on a basis consistent with internal reporting used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM to assess the performance of operating segments and the allocation of resources.
The CODM has been identified as the Group ExecutiveOffice Committee.
The internal reporting used by the CODM includes product information which comprises analysis of product revenues, LTM advances and amounts written under investment contracts and information on adjusted operating profit and profit before tax for the Groups operating segments.
Product information is analysed by product line and includes DB, GIfL, Care Plans, Protection, LTM and Capped Drawdown products.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incursexpenses.
The operating segments from which the Group derives revenues and incurs expenses are as follows: The writing of insurance products for distribution to the ator in-retirement market, which is undertaken through the activities of the life company: the arranging of guaranteed income for life contracts and lifetime mortgages through a regulated advice and intermediary services: and the provision of licensed software to financial advisers, banks, building societies, life assurance companies and pension trustees.
Operating segments, where certain materiality thresholds in relation to total results from operating segments are not exceeded, are combined when determining reportable segments.
For segmental reporting, the arranging of guaranteed income for life contracts, providing intermediary mortgage advice and arranging, plus the provision of licensed software, are included in the Other segment along with Group activities, such as capital and liquidity management, and investment activities.
The information on adjusted operating profit and profit before tax used by the CODM is presented on a combined product basis within the insurance operating segment and is not analysed further by product.
1.5 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange at the reporting date.
The revenues and expenses are translated to sterling at the average rates of exchange for the period.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation to sterling are accounted for through other comprehensive income.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 107 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.6 Classification of insurance and investment contracts The measurement and presentation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses arising from life and pensions business contracts is dependent upon the classification of those contracts as either insurance or investment contracts.
A contract is classified as insurance only if it transfers significant insurance risk.
Insurance risk is significant if an insured event could cause an insurer to pay significant additional benefits to those payable if no insured event occurred.
A contract that is classified as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire.
Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts.
Capped Drawdown pension business and Flexible Pension Plan contracts are classified as investment contracts as there is no transfer of longevity risk due to the fixed term and unit-linked natures of these respective contracts.
1.7 Premium revenue Premium revenue in respect of Individual GIfL contracts is accounted for when the premiums are received, which coincides with when the liability to pay the GIfL contract is established.
Premium revenue in respect of Defined Benefit fide-risking contracts is accounted for when the Company becomes on risk, which is the date from which the policy is effective.
If a timing difference occurs between the date from which the policy is effective and the receipt of payment, the amount due for payment but not yet received is recognised as a receivable in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Premium revenue in respect of Care Plans and Protection policies are recognised in the accounting period in which the insurance contract commences.
Facilitated adviser charges, are not accounted for within premium revenue, and do not represent a charge on the Group.
Deposits collected under investment contracts are not accounted for through the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for fee income and attributable investment income, but are accounted for directly through the Consolidated statement of financial position as an adjustment to the investment contract liability.
Reinsurance premiums payable in respect of reinsurance treaties are accounted for when the reinsurance premiums are due for payment under the terms of the contract.
Reinsurance premiums previously incurred can be recaptured under certain conditions, notably once reinsurance financing for an underwriting year is fullyrepaid.
1.8 Net investment income Investment income consists of interest receivable for the period and realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
Realised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities occur on disposal or transfer and represent the difference between the proceeds received net of transaction costs, and the original cost.
Unrealised gains and losses arising on financial assets and liabilities represent the difference between the carrying value at the end of the reporting period and the carrying value at the start of the reporting period or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the period.
1.9 Fee and commission income Fee and commission income, which consists of fee income for initial advances made on loans secured by mortgages, investment management fees, administration fees and commission, are recognised as the services are rendered.
Revenue is recognised in full on acceptance and inception of the contract by the product provider as there are no post-placement obligations.
In addition, operating income includes fees from software licensing which are recognised across the license period.
1.10 Claims paid Policyholder benefits are accounted for when due for payment.
Reinsurance paid claim recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the relatedclaim.
Death claims are accounted for when notified.
1.11 Acquisition costs Acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as commission and indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Acquisition costs are not deferred as they relate to single premium business.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 108 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued 1.12 Leases Leases, where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of thelease.
1.13 Finance costs Finance costs on deposits received from reinsurers are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Interest on reinsurance financing is accrued in accordance with the terms of the financing arrangements.
Interest on loans and borrowings is accrued in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.
Loan issue costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan issued.
Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
1.14 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds managed by a third party.
Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when due.
Share-based payment transactions Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date, determined using stochastic and scenario-based modelling techniques where appropriate.
The fair value is expensed in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity, based on the Groups estimate of the equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest as a result of changes in non-market-based vesting conditions, and recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where a leaver is entitled to their scheme benefits, this is treated as an acceleration of the vesting in the period they leave.
Where a scheme is modified before it vests, any change in fair value as a result of the modification is recognised over the remaining vesting period.
Where a scheme is cancelled, this is treated as an acceleration in the period of the vesting of all remainingoptions.
1.15 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
The calculation of the weighted-average number of ordinary shares excludes ordinary shares held in trusts on behalf of employee share schemes.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares held in trusts on behalf of employee share schemes, is adjusted to assume conversion of potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees, if their conversion would dilute earnings per share.
1.16 Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill, which is deemed to have an indefinite useful life, Purchased Value of In-Force PVIF, brand TM and purchased and internally developed software including PrognoSys, which are deemed to have finite useful lives.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary and represents the future economic benefit arising from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
Goodwill is measured at initial value less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised, but assessed for impairment annually or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over the carrying value.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units and an impairment is recognised when the carrying value of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised directly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and are notsubsequently reversed.
Other intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group, and are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairments.
PVIF, representing the present value of future profits from the purchased in-force business, is recognised upon acquisition and is amortised over its expected remaining economic life up to 16 years on a straight-line basis.
TM PrognoSys is the Groups proprietary underwriting engine.
The Group has over 2 million person-years of experience collected over twenty years of operations.
It is enhanced by an extensive breadth of external primary and secondary healthcare data and medical literature.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 109 1 Significant accounting policies continued Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are capitalised and recognised as an intangible asset.
Direct costs include the incremental software development teams employee costs.
All other costs associated with researching or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense asincurred.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which range from three to 16 years.
The useful lives are determined by considering relevant factors, such as usage of the asset, potential obsolescence, competitive position and stability of the industry.
For intangible assets with finite useful lives, impairment testing is performed where there is an indication that the carrying value of the assets may be subject to an impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The significant intangible assets recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are asfollows: Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life Valuation method PVIF Up to 16 years Estimated value in-force using European Embedded Valuemodel Brand 2 5 years Estimated royalty stream if the rights were to be licensed Distribution network 3 years Estimated discounted cash flow Software 2 3 years Estimated replacement cost Intellectual property 12 15 years Estimated replacement cost The useful economic lives of intangible assets recognised by the Group other than those acquired in a business combination are asfollows: Intangible asset Estimated useful economic life TM PrognoSys 12 years Software 3 years 1.17 Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings are measured at their revalued amounts less subsequent depreciation, and impairment losses are recognised at the date of revaluation.
Valuations are performed with sufficient frequency to ensure that the fair value of the revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying value.
A revaluation surplus is recognised in Other comprehensive income and credited to the revaluation reserve in equity.
However, to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss, the increase is recognised in profit or loss.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the revaluation reserve.
Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings of 25 years.
Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the cost to residual value over the estimated useful lives asfollows: Computer equipment 3 to 4years Furniture and fittings 2 to 10years 1.18 Financial investments Classification The Group classifies financial investments in accordance with IAS 39 whereby, subject to specific criteria, they are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
This comprises assets designated by management as fair value through profit and loss on inception, as they are managed on a fair value basis, and derivatives that are classified as held for trading.
These investments are measured at fair value with all changes thereon being recognised in investment income in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets.
Amounts payable or receivable on unsettled purchases or sales are recognised in other payables or other receivables respectively.
Transaction costs are expensed through profit and loss.
Loans secured by residential mortgages are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 110 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued The Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or gilts in respect of derivative contracts.
Collateral received is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding liability for the repayment in otherfinancial liabilities.
Collateral pledged is recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position within the appropriate asset classification.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit and loss.
The fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not available, by using standard valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.
All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and liabilities when the fair values are negative.
The Group does not use hedge accounting.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial investments when it is deemed that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Use of fair value The Group uses current bid prices to value its investments with quoted prices.
Actively traded investments without quoted prices are valued using prices provided by third parties.
If there is no active established market for an investment, the Group applies an appropriate valuation technique such as discounted cash flow analysis.
Determining the fair value of financial investments when the markets are not active The Group holds certain financial investments for when the markets are not active.
These comprise financial investments which are not quoted in active markets and include loans secured by residential mortgages, derivatives and other financial investments for when markets are not active.
When the markets are not active, there is generally no or limited observable market data that can be used in the fair value measurement of the financial investments.
The determination of whether an active market exists for a financial investment requires managements judgement.
If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group establishes fair value for these financial investments by using quotations from independent third parties or internally developed pricing models.
The valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analysis.
The valuation techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates and, for loans secured by mortgages, mortality, future expenses, voluntary redemptions and house price assumptions.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables impact the reported fair value of these financial instruments positively or negatively.
The financial investments measured at fair value are classified into the following three-level hierarchy on the basis of the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement of the financial investment concerned: Level 1: Quoted price unadjusted in active markets for identical assets andliabilities: Level 2: I nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly i. e. derived fromprices : and Level 3: Significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservableinputs.
1.19 Reinsurance Reinsurance assets Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are measured in a consistent manner with insurance liabilities and are classified as reinsurance assets.
If a reinsurance asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly and that impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities Where reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group are structured to provide financing, with financing components to be repaid in future periods, such amounts are classified as reinsurance finance and included in other financial liabilities in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Where reinsurance contracts entered into by the Group require deposits received from reinsurers to be repaid, such amounts are classified as deposits received from reinsurers and included in other financial liabilities in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Where the liability carries no insurance risk, it is initially recognised at fair value at the date the deposited asset is recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is determined as the amount payable discounted from the first date that the amount is required to be paid.
All other deposits received from reinsurers are valued in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contracts, which take into account an appropriate discount rate for the timing of expected cash flows.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 111 1 Significant accounting policies continued Amounts receivable payable Where reinsurance contracts the Group has entered into include longevity swap arrangements, such contracts are settled on a net basis and amounts receivable from or payable to the reinsurers are included in the appropriate heading under either Insurance and other receivables or Insurance and other payables.
1.20 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with less than 90 days maturity from the date of acquisition.
1.21 Equity The difference between the proceeds received on issue of the shares, net of share issue costs, and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Interim dividends are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recognised when they have been approved by shareholders.
Where the Company purchases shares for the purposes of employee incentive plans, the consideration paid, net of issue costs, is deducted from equity.
Upon issue or sale any consideration received is credited to equity net of related costs.
The reserve arising on the reorganisation of the Group represents the difference in the value of the shares in the Company and the value of shares in Just Retirement Group Holdings Limited for which they were exchanged as part of the Group reorganisation in November 2013.
1.22 Insurance liabilities Measurement Long-term insurance liabilities arise from the Group writing Retirement Income contracts, including Defined Benefit fide-risking solutions, long-term care insurance, and whole of life and term protection insurance.
Their measurement uses estimates of projected future cash flows arising from payments to policyholders plus the costs of administering them.
Valuation of insurance liabilities is derived using discount rates, adjusted for default allowance, and mortality assumptions, taken from the appropriate mortality tables and adjusted to reflect actual and expected experience.
Liability adequacy test The Group performs adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure the carrying amount is sufficient to cover the current estimate of future cash flows.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
1.23 Investment contract liabilities Investment contracts are measured at fair value through profit and loss in accordance with IAS 39.
The fair value of investment contracts is estimated using an internal model and determined on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of futureRetirement Income benefit and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of thecontract.
1.24 Loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently amortised through profit andloss over the period to maturity at the effective rate of interest required to recognise the discounted estimated cash flows tomaturity.
1.25 Other provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
The amount recorded as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is the present value of the expected expenditure.
1.26 Taxation The current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the Consolidated statement of financial position date, and after any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax, including tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over profits before taxation and amounts charged or credited to components of other comprehensive income and equity as appropriate.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, using the liability method, on all material temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including technical provisions and other insurance items and tax losses carried forward, and include amortised transitional tax adjustments resulting from changes in tax basis.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
2 Acquisition of Partnership Assurance Group plc On 4 April 2016, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the ordinary share capital of Partnership Assurance Group plc PAG through an all share exchange which gave PAG shareholders 0.834 Just Retirement Group plc JRP shares for every PAG share held, with effective control having passed on 1 April 2016.
In total, 368,376,421 new JRP shares were issued and commenced trading on 4 April 2016.
As a result, PAG shareholders hold approximately 40% of the enlarged share capital of the Combined Group.
At the closing price of 154.60 pence on 1 April 2016, the share exchange represented consideration of 569.5m.
As part of the acquisition certain employee share schemes granted to PAG employees have been exchanged for equivalent JRP employee share schemes.
The fair value cost of replacing those schemes, included in the consideration for PAG, was 2.4m.
Established in 2005 following the acquisition of the business of the Pension Annuity Friendly Society, PAG was a UK life insurance group whose strategy was aligned with that of the Group.
PAG was focused on retirement income products, offering better rates to customers who suffer from shortened life expectancy by utilising an intellectual property led, capital-efficient business model.
Following the Pensions Freedom changes announced in the 2014 Budget, PAG increased its focus on the defined benefit scheme fide-risking segment whilst continually developing its individually underwritten annuities.
The acquisition recognises the benefits of greater scale, enhanced intellectual property, a broader product proposition and a more efficient distribution platform that will improve the potential of the Group to succeed in its chosen markets in the future.
In accordance with the accounting standard on Business Combinations IFRS 3, valuations used in acquisition balance sheets may be refined within one year following the acquisition date.
The fair value of PAG identifiable assets and liabilities acquired have been determined to have a net value of 571.6m, compared with the initial value of 644.7m disclosed in the 30 June 2016 Interim report.
When compared with consideration of 571.9m, goodwill of 0.3m has arisen on acquisition, as follows: Fair value m Assets Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets before goodwill 169.6 Property, plant and equipment 8.7 Financial investments 5,293.9 Investment in joint ventures and associates 0.2 Reinsurance assets 3,299.5 Deferred tax assets 8.3 Prepayments and accrued income 3.1 Insurance and other receivables 41.5 Cash and cash equivalents 268.6 Total assets 9,093.4 Liabilities Insurance liabilities 5,619.8 Loans and borrowings 94.3 Financial liabilities 2,737.2 Deferred tax liabilities 32.5 Current tax liabilities 1.3 Insurance and other payables 36.7 Total liabilities 8,521.8 Net assets 571.6 Goodwill arising on acquisition 0.3 Total net assets acquired 571.9 Fair value of shares exchanged 569.5 Fair value cost of exchanging employee share schemes 2.4 Total consideration 571.9 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 113 2 Acquisition of Partnership Assurance Group plc continued The issue of new shares in the Company in exchange for shares of PAG will attract merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Of the 569.5m, 36.8m has been credited to share capital representing 10 pence per ordinary share and the remaining 532.7m has been credited to the merger reserve within equity.
Fair value and accounting policy adjustments Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets On completion of the acquisition, the economic assumptions applied to the actuarial models used to determine the value of insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets have been reviewed across the Group.
Following this review, consistent economic and other assumptions have been applied to all Group entities, resulting in an increase of 37.3m to PAGs insurance liabilities and an increase of 6.2m to PAGs reinsurance assets recognised on acquisition.
Similarly, consistent economic assumptions have been applied to the models used to determine the fair value of loan assets secured by mortgages, resulting in an increase of 30.7m to the value of PAGs mortgage loan assets.
Financial liabilities PAGs subordinated debt liability has been recognised at fair value on acquisition.
The fair value represents a 5.8m reduction to the amortised cost of the debt liability.
The methodology applied to the valuation of reinsurance deposit back liabilities in Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited has also been reviewed and a Group accounting basis has been adopted.
Together with the impact of other basis alignments, this resulted in a 74.7m increase in the value of PAGs financial liabilities.
Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets An asset of 142.7m was recognised on acquisition representing the present value of future profits from the acquired in-force business as of 1 April 2016.
Future profit streams have been discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital of 11.1%, which was determined using a capital asset pricing model CAPM approach.
This will be amortised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Intangible assets of 26.9m represent PAGs distribution and customer relationships, brands, technology and software including IP, and other intangibles.
These balances will be amortised over their remaining useful economic lives, in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Goodwill arising on acquisition The acquisition resulted in goodwill of 0.3m, representing the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired.
The acquisition consideration consisted of shares in the Group exchanged for shares in PAG at a ratio set at the announcement of the transaction on 11 August 2015.
Profit and loss If the acquisition had been effective on 1 July 2015, on a pro forma basis the Groups revenue is estimated at 4,368.7m and profit before tax attributable to shareholders is estimated at 121.2m for the 18 month period ending 31 December 2016.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 July 2015.
The pro forma results are provided for information purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 July 2015.
Since 1 April 2016 363.3m has been recognised within the Groups revenue and 24.0m has been recognised within the Groups profit before tax attributable to shareholders arising from the acquiredentities.
Acquisition costs of 23.4m incurred to support the transaction have been recognised within other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 115 7 Segmental reporting Adjusted operating profit The Group reports adjusted operating profit as an alternative measure of profit which the Group uses for decision making and performance measurement.
The Board believes that adjusted operating profit, which excludes effects of short-term economic and investment changes, provides a better view of the longer-term performance and development of the business and aligns with the longer-term nature of the products.
The underlying operating profit represents a combination of both the profits generated from new business written in the period and profits expected to emerge from the in-force book of business based on current assumptions.
Actual operating experience where different from that assumed at the start of the period and the impacts of changes to future operating assumptions applied in the period are then also included in arriving at adjusted operating profit.
New business profits represent expected investment returns on financial instruments backing shareholder and policyholder funds after allowances for expected movements in liabilities and acquisition costs.
Profits arising from the in-force book of business represent the expected return on surplus assets, the expected unwind of prudent reserves above best estimates for mortality, expenses, corporate bond defaults and, with respect to lifetime mortgages, no-negative guarantee and early redemptions.
Adjusted operating profit excludes the impairment and amortisation of goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation, restructuring costs and other exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those items that, in the Directors view, are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Variances between actual and expected investment returns due to economic and market changes are also disclosed outside adjusted operating profit.
Segmental analysis The Insurance segment writes insurance products for the retirement market which include Guaranteed Income for Life Solutions and Defined Benefit fide-risking Solutions, Care Plans, Flexible Pension Plan and Protection and invests the premiums received from these contracts in debt securities, gilts, liqudity funds and lifetime mortgage advances.
From a management reporting perspective, these are managed together, with LTM being an integral part of the insurance business model.
The professional services business is included with other corporate companies in the Other segment.
This business is not currently sufficiently significant to separate from other companies result and the CODM does not separately consider its results at present.
The Other segment also includes the Groups corporate activities that are primarily involved in managing the Groups liquidity, capital and investment activities.
The Group operates in one material geographical segment which is the United Kingdom.

In the Budget on 16 March 2016, the Chancellor announced a further reduction to the corporation tax rate to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 which was substantively enacted on 15 September 2016.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly, although there will be no material effect.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2016 have been calculated based on the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
Taxation of life insurance companies was fundamentally changed following the publication of the Finance Act 2012.
Since 1 January 2013, life insurance tax has been based on financial statements: prior to this date, the basis for profits chargeable to corporation tax was surplus arising within the Pillar 1 regulatory regime.
Cumulative differences arising between the two bases, which represent the differences in retained profits and taxable surplus which are not excluded items for taxation, are brought back into the computation of taxable profits.
However, legislation provides for transitional arrangements whereby such differences are amortised on a straight-line basis over a ten year period from 1 January 2013.
Similarly the resulting cumulative transitional adjustments for tax purposes in adoption of IFRS will be amortised on a straight-line basis over a ten year period from 1 January 2016.
The tax charge for the period to 31 December 2016 includes profits chargeable to corporation tax arising from amortisation of transitional balances of 10.1m 2015: 3.0 m. 9 Remuneration of Directors Information concerning individual Directors emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
For the purposes of the disclosure required by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the Directors in respect of the 18 months ended 31 December 2016 was 6.7m 2015: 3.4m.
Employer contributions to pensions for Executive Directors for qualifying periods were nil 2015: nil.
The aggregate net value of share awards granted to the Directors in the period was 5.6m 2015: 2.6m.
The net value has been calculated by reference to the closing middle-market price of an ordinary share at the date of grant.
No Directors exercised share options during the period whilst a Director of the Company.

The fair value attributed to the Partnership brand has been impaired following the adoption of the Just brand.
The lease intangible asset has been impaired as a result of the rationalisation of office space.
Impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, at least annually.
The Groups goodwill of 33.1m at 31 December 2016 represents 0.3m recognised in the period on the acquisition of the Partnership Assurance Group and 32.8m on the 2009 acquisition by Just Retirement Group Holdings Limited of Just Retirement Holdings Limited, the holding company of Just Retirement Limited JRL.
The existing goodwill has been allocated to the insurance segment as the cash generating unit.
The recoverable amounts of goodwill have been determined from value-in-use.
The key assumptions of this calculation are notedbelow: 2016 2015 Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years 5 years Discount rate pre-tax 12.0% 12.0% Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 125 14 Intangible assets continued The value-in-use of the insurance operating segment is considered by reference to latest business plans over the next five years, and a stressed scenario that assumes no growth in sales for the next five years and discount rate of 20%.
The outcome of the impairment assessment under both scenarios is that the goodwill in respect of the insurance operating segment is not impaired and that the value-in-use is higher than the carrying value of goodwill.
Any reasonably possible changes in assumption will not cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts.

a Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as awhole.
Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include thefollowing: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in activemarkets: quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which very little information is released publicly: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset orliability: and market-corroborated inputs.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 127 16 Financial investments continued Where the Group uses broker asset manager quotes and no information as to observability of inputs is provided by the broker asset manager, the investments are classified asfollows: Where the broker asset manager price is validated by using internal models with market-observable inputs and the values are similar, the investment is classified as Level2: and in circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker asset manager prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers asset managers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
The majority of the Groups debt securities held at fair value and financial derivatives are valued using independent pricing services or third party broker quotes, and therefore classified as Level 2.
Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i. e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
Unobservable inputs reflect the same assumptions as those that the market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Groups assets and liabilities held at fair value which are valued using valuation techniques for which significant observable market data is not available and classified as Level 3 include loans secured by mortgages, asset-backed securities, and investment contractliabilities.
The valuation of loans secured by mortgages is determined using internal models which project future cash flows expected to arise from each loan.
Future cash flows allow for assumptions relating to future expenses, future mortality experience, costs arising from no-negative equity guarantees and voluntary redemptions.
The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at a swap rate plus a liquidity premium.
During the prior year the internal model used to value the loans secured by residential mortgages was recalibrated in respect of the liquidity premium added to the swap rate.
Previously the liquidity premium was considered to be unobservable and was therefore set at zero.
This gave rise to a day-one gain which was deferred and recognised over the expected life of the loan.
The recalibration process reassessed the level of the liquidity premium and this is now considered to be an observable input to the internal model.
As a result of the recalibration, a day-one gain no longer arises, and profit is recognised over the term of the contract.
There is no longer any aggregate difference yet to be recognised in profit or loss between the fair value of the mortgages at initial recognition and the amount that would have been determined at that date using the valuation technique.
The Level 3 bonds are mainly infrastructure private placement bonds or asset-backed securities.
Such securities are valued using discounted cash flow analyses using prudent assumptions based on the repayment of the underlying bond.
The level 3 Other loans are  loans, and are valued using discounted cash flow analyses using prudent assumptions based on the repayment of the underlying loan.
Investment contract liabilities are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis using a prospective valuation of future retirement income benefits and expense cash flows, but with an adjustment to amortise any day-one gain over the life of thecontract.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements as at 31 December 2016 30 June 2015: nil.

Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the debt securities and other fixed income securities classified as Level3.
Redemption and defaults The redemption and default assumptions used in the valuation of infrastructure private placement bonds are similar to the rest of the Groups bond portfolio.
For asset-backed securities, the assumptions are that the underlying loans supporting the securities are redeemed in the future in a similar profile to the existing redemptions on an average rate of 3% per annum, and that default levels on the underlying basis remain at the current level of the Groups bond portfolio.
Sensitivity analysis Changes to unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in the fair value of the assets.
The Group has estimated the impact on profit for the period in changes to these inputs as follows: Debt securities and other fixed income securities Default assumption Net increase decrease in profit before tax m 100bps 31 December 2016 1.7 30 June 2015 0.2 JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 130 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Financial investments continued Loans secured by residential mortgages Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of loans secured by residential mortgages All gains and losses arising from loans secured by mortgages are largely dependent on the term of the mortgage, which in turn is determined by the longevity of the customer.
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of loans secured by mortgages include the following: Maintenance expenses Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Groups recent expense analyses.
The assumed future expense levels incorporate an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.3% for loans written by Just Retirement 30 June 2015: 3.8% and 4.3% for loans written by Partnership.
Mortality Mortality assumptions have been derived by reference to appropriate standard mortality tables.
These tables have been adjusted to reflect the expected future mortality experience of mortgage contract holders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the sales process and the Groups assessment of how this experience will develop in the future.
This assessment takes into consideration relevant industry and population studies, published research materials, input from the Groups lead reinsurer and managements own experience.
Property prices The value of a property at the date of valuation is calculated by taking the latest valuation for that property and indexing this value using the Office for National Statistics monthly index for the propertys location.
Voluntary redemptions Assumptions for future voluntary redemption levels are based on the Groups recent analyses and external benchmarking, and the assumed redemption rate for policies in their first year is 0.7% for loans written by Just Retirement 30 June 2015: 0.6% and 1.8% for loans written by Partnership.
The Group has estimated the impact on profit for the period in changes to these inputs as follows: Loans secured by residential mortgages valuationassumptions Maintenance Property Voluntary expenses Mortality prices redemptions Net increase decrease in profit before tax m 10% -5% -20% 10% 31 December 2016 5.9 36.8 79.8 30.7 30 June 2015 4.1 15.3 52.2 14.3 This sensitivity assumes an additional 10% reduction to property prices over and above the 10% fall assumed in the base position.
The sensitivity factors are determined via actuarial models.
The analysis has been prepared for a change in each variable with other assumptions remaining constant.
In reality such an occurrence is unlikely due to the correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from theseresults.
The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any actual market movementoccurs.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represents the Groups view of reasonably possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that there is a parallel shift in interest rates at alldurations.
Loans secured by commercial mortgages Principal assumption s underlying the calculation of loans secured by commercial mortgages The discount rate is the most significant assumption applied in calculating the fair value of the loans secured by commercial mortgages.
The discount rate used 0.9% plus a spread % of between 1.3% and 2.8% depending on the individual loan.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 131 16 Financial investments continued Sensitivity analysis Changes to unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique could give rise to significant changes in the fair value of the assets.

Loans secured by commercial mortgages valuationassumptions Net increase decrease in profit before tax m Interest rates 100bps 31 December 2016 9.5 Other loans Other loans classified as Level 3 are infrastructure loans.
Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of other loans classified as Level3 Redemption and defaults The redemption and default assumptions used in the valuation of infrastructure loans are similar to the Groups bond portfolio.
They have additional covenants which provide greater security but these are not quantified in the valuation.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of profit before tax to changes in default assumptions and redemption profiles in respect of Level 3 infrastructure loans is not material.
Recoveries from reinsurers on investment contracts Recoveries from reinsurers on investment contracts represent fully reinsured funds invested under the Flexible Pension Plan.
The linked liabilities are included in Level 3 investment contract liabilities.
Principal assumptions and sensitivity of profit before tax Recoveries from reinsurers on investment contracts are valued based on the price of the reinsured underlying funds determined by the asset managers.
The assets are classified as Level 3 because the prices are not validated by internal models or the observable inputs used by the asset managers are not available.
Therefore, there are no principal assumptions used in the valuation of these Level 3 assets.
Investment contract liabilities Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of investment contract liabilities Maintenance expenses Assumptions for future policy expense levels are based on the Groups recent expense analyses.
The assumed future expense levels incorporate an annual inflation rate allowance of 4.5% 30 June 2015: 4.1%.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of profit before tax to changes in maintenance expense assumptions in respect of investment contract liabilities is not material.
Deposits received from reinsurers Principal assumption s underlying the calculation of deposits received from reinsurers Discount rate The valuation model discounts the expected future cash flows using a contractual discount rate derived from the assets hypothecated to back the liabilities at a product level.
The discount rates used as at 31 December 2016 for Individual retirement and Individual care annuities were 3.24% and 1.17% respectively 30 June 2015: not applicable.
Credit spreads The valuation of deposits received from reinsurers includes a credit spread applied by individual reinsurer.
A credit spread of 166bps was applied in respect of the most significant reinsurance contract.

JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 134 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Insurance contracts and related reinsurance continued The insurance liabilities are determined by the Board on the advice of the Groups Actuarial Reporting Function using recognised actuarial methods.
In particular, a prospective gross premium valuation method has been adopted for major classes of business.
Although the process for the establishment of insurance liabilities follows specified rules and guidelines, the provisions that result from the process remain uncertain.
As a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual value of claims could vary from the amounts provided to cover future claims.
The Group seeks to provide for appropriate levels of contract liabilities taking known facts and experiences into account but nevertheless such provisions remain uncertain.
The estimation process used in determining insurance liabilities involves projecting future annuity payments and the cost of maintaining the contracts.
For non-annuity contracts, the liability is determined as the sum of the discounted value of future benefit payments and future administration expenses less the expected value of premiums payable under the contract.
The key sensitivities are the assumed level of interest rates and the mortality experience.
b Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of insurance contracts The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of insurance contracts are as follows: Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions have been set by reference to appropriate standard mortality tables.
These tables have been adjusted to reflect the future mortality experience of the policyholders, taking into account the medical and lifestyle evidence collected during the underwriting process, premium size, gender and the Groups assessment of how this experience will develop in the future.
The assessment takes into consideration relevant industry and population studies, published research materials, input from the Groups lead reinsurer and managements own industryexperience.
The standard tables which underpin the mortality assumptions are summarised in the table below.

A decrease in the valuation interest rate increases the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The PLACL valuation interest rate at 31 December 2016 was 3.24%.
Expense inflation The maintenance expense inflation assumption used at 31 December 2016 was 4.5% p. a.
30 June 2015: 4.1% p. a.. Non-economic assumption change Expense assumption The JRL GIfL maintenance expense assumption used at 31 December 2016 was 46.68 per plan, an increase from 43.97 per plan at 30 June2015, whilst the JRL DB maintenance assumption used at 31 December 2016 was 56.61 per plan 30 June 2015: 53.32 per plan.
An increase in the maintenance expense assumption increases the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The PLACL GIfL and DB maintenance assumption used at 31 December 2016 was 22.99 per plan.

Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied The impact of a change in the market interest rates by - 1% e. g. if a current interest rate is 5%, the Interest rate and impact of an immediate change to 4 and 6% respectively.
The test allows consistently allows for similar investment return changes to investment returns and movements in the market by backing fixed interest securities Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10% The impact of a decrease in mortality rates by 5% applied to both Retirement Income liabilities and Mortality rates mortgage assets The impact of an immediate decrease in the value of properties by 20%.

The test allows for the impact on the annuity liabilities arising from Voluntary redemptions any change in yield on the loans secured by residential mortgages and loans secured by commercial mortgages used to back the liabilities Impact on profit before tax m Interest Interest Maintenance Property Voluntary rates rates expenses Mortality prices redemptions Net increase decrease in profit before tax m 1% -1% 10% -5% -20% 10% 31 December 2016 177.5 225.1 49.2 131.3 106.3 67.9 30 June 2015 25.9 83.7 19.9 48.9 52.2 14.3 This sensitivity assumes an additional 10% reduction to property prices over and above the 10% fall assumed in the base position.
The sensitivity factors are applied via actuarial models.
In reality, such an occurrence is unlikely, due to correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts cannot be interpolated or extrapolated from theseresults.
Property growth assumptions in the base balance sheet at 31 December 2016 allow for a -10% year-on-year fall in property prices between June 2016 and June 2017.
This sensitivity allows for the change in lifetime mortgage and commercial mortgage asset value arising from an immediate fall of 20% in property prices.
For lifetime mortgages, from 30 June 2017 onwards, the sensitivity assumes an additional 10% reduction in property prices over and above the 10% fall assumed in the base position.
The sensitivity also allows for the corresponding change in liabilities as a result of the yield change.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 137 22 Insurance contracts and related reinsurance continued The sensitivity factors take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed and may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
The impacts indicated above for insurance contracts also reflect movements in financial derivatives, which are impacted by movements in interest rates.
Related reinsurance assets are not impacted by financialderivatives.

These products are no longer available to new customers.
In return for a single premium, these contracts pay a guaranteed lump sum on survival to the end of the fixed term.
There is an option at outset to select a lower sum at maturity and regular income until the earlier of death or maturity.
Upon death of the policyholder and subject to the option selected at the outset, there may be a return of premium less income received or income payable to a dependant until the death of thatdependant.
b Principal assumptions underlying the calculation of investment contracts Valuation discount rates Valuation discount rate assumptions for investment contracts are set with regards to yields on supporting assets.
An explicit allowance for credit risk is included by making an explicit deduction from the yields on debt and other fixed income securities based on historical default experience of each assetclass.
The changes in the valuation discount rates reflect the changes in yields on the supportingassets.

On 9 May 2013, Deutsche Bank AG and Nomura International plc acceded to the loan agreement under the terms of an accordion feature, with each providing loans of 10m to Just Retirement Holdings Limited.
On 7 August 2015, Just Retirement Holdings Limited entered into an amendment to the original loan agreement and on 10 August 2015 drew down a further 30m from each of Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Barclays Bank plc.
3.6m of the loan was repaid on 11 October 2013, 4.5m was repaid on 11 October 2014, and 8.8m was repaid on 11 October 2015.
The outstanding balance was repaid in full in October 2016.
The fair value of the bank borrowings is the same as the carrying value.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 138 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 24 Loans and borrowings continued Subordinated debt In March 2015, the Partnership Group issued a 100m Solvency II Tier 2 qualifying instrument at par with a maturity date of March2025 and a coupon of 9.5%.
Net of issuance fees the amount received was 99.9m.
The fair value of the debt at the date of acquisition of PAG was 94.1m, and the difference to the nominal value is being amortised over the period to maturity.
The carrying value at 31 December 2016 of 94.6m compares with a fair value of 105.5m.

a Derivative financial liabilities and obligations for repayment of cash collateral received The derivative financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
All financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such on initial recognition or, in the case of derivative financial liabilities, are classified as held for trading.
b Deposits received from reinsurers Deposits received from reinsurers are measured in accordance with the reinsurance contract and taking into account an appropriate discount rate for the timing of expected cash flows of the liabilities.
c Reinsurance finance The reinsurance finance has been established in recognition of the loan obligation to the reinsurers under the Groups reinsurance financing arrangements, the repayment of which remain contingent upon the emergence of surplus under the old Solvency I valuation rules.
d Reinsurance funds withheld Reinsurance funds withheld are measured and valued in accordance with the reinsurance contract, which takes into account an appropriate discount rate for the timing of expected cash flows.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 139 26 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates, counterparty credit risk, inflation and foreign exchange risk, including interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, inflation swaps, credit default swaps, and foreign currency asset swaps.

Derivatives are used to manage the Groups European embedded value and regulatory capital, which is affected by a surplus of long-dated fixed interest securities when liabilities are measured on a realisticbasis.
All over-the-counter derivative transactions are conducted under standardised International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. ISDA master agreements, and the Group has collateral agreements between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties in place under each of these market master agreements.
As at 31 December 2016, the Company had pledged collateral of 176.6m 30 June 2015: 55.6m of which 105.6m were gilts and European Investment Bank bonds 30 June 2015: 38.4m and had received cash collateral of 52.2m 30 June 2015: 18.6m.

New business was reinsured via longevity swap arrangements as follows: DB is 55% reinsured for underwritten schemes, and 75% for non-underwritten schemes 55% prior to 1 January 2016 GIfL is 75% reinsured 45% prior to 1 January 2016 Care is 42.5% reinsured 90% prior to 1 April 2016 Protection is 65% reinsured In-force business is reinsured under longevity swap and quota share treaties.
The quota share treaties have deposit back or premium withheld arrangements to remove the majority of the reinsurer credit risk.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 140 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 27 Reinsurance continued The quota share treaties entered into by the Groups subsidiary, Just Retirement Limited JRL, include financing arrangements see note 25c, the repayment of which is contingent upon the emergence of surplus under the old Solvency I valuation rules.
The Group retains a capital benefit under Solvency II from the financing arrangements as these form part of the transitional calculations.
These treaties also allow JRL to recapture business once the financing has been repaid.
During the period the Group recaptured business in respect of certain underwriting years that resulted in a decrease of ceded liabilities of 1,166.9m and a reduction of equal amount in the deposit received.
In addition to the deposits received from reinsurers recognised within other financial liabilities see note 25b, certain reinsurance arrangements within the Groups subsidiary, Partnership Life Assurance Company Limited, give rise to deposits from reinsurers that are not included in the Consolidated statement of financial position of the Group as described below:- The Group has an agreement with two reinsurers 30 June 2015: nil whereby financial assets arising from the payment of reinsurance premiums, less the repayment of claims, in relation to specific treaties are legally and physically deposited back with the Group.
Although the funds are managed by the Group as the Group controls the investment of the asset, no future benefits accrue to the Group as any returns on the deposits are paid to reinsurers.
Consequently the deposits are not recognised as assets of the Group and the investment income they produce does not accrue to the Group.
The Group has an agreement with one reinsurer 30 June 2015: nil whereby assets equal to the reinsurers full obligation under the treaty are deposited into a ringfenced collateral account.
The Group has first claim over these assets should the reinsurer default, but as the Group has no control over these funds and does not accrue any future benefit, this fund is not recognised as an asset of the Group.

34 Financial and insurance risk management This note presents information about the major financial and insurance risks to which the Group is exposed, and its objectives, policies and processes for their measurement and management.
Financial risk comprises exposure to market, credit and liquidityrisk.
a Insurance risk The writing of long-term insurance contracts requires a range of assumptions to be made and risk arises from these assumptions being materiallyinaccurate.
The Groups main insurance risk arises from adverse experience compared with the assumptions used in pricing products and valuing insurance liabilities, and in addition its reinsurance treaties may be terminated, not renewed, or renewed on terms less favourable than those under existing treaties.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to longevity, mortality and morbidity and exposure to factors such as withdrawal levels and management and administration expenses.
Individually underwritten GIfL are priced using assumptions about future longevity that are based on historic experience information, lifestyle and medical factors relevant to individual customers, and judgements about the future development of longevity improvements.
In the event of an increase in longevity, the actuarial reserve required to make future payments to customers may increase.
Loans secured by mortgages are used to match some of the liabilities arising from the sale of GIfL and DB business.
In the event that early repayments in a given period are higher than anticipated, less interest will have accrued on the mortgages and the amount repayable will be less than assumed at the time of sale.
In the event of an increase in longevity, although more interest will have accrued and the amount repayable will be greater than assumed at the time of the sale, the associated cash flows will be received later than had originally been anticipated.
In addition, a general increase in longevity would have the effect of increasing the total amount repayable, which would increase the LTV ratio and could increase the risk of failing to be repaid in full as a consequence of the no-negative equity guarantee.
There is also morbidity risk exposure as the contract ends when the customer moves into long-term care.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 142 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 34 Financial and insurance risk management continued Underpinning the management of insurance risk are: The development and use of medical information including PrognoSys for both pricing and reserving to provide detailed insight into longevity risk: adherence to approved underwriting requirements: controls around the development of suitable products and their pricing: review and approval of assumptions used by the Board: regular monitoring and analysis of actual experience: use of reinsurance to minimise volatility of capital requirement and profit: and monitoring of expense levels.
Concentrations of insurance risk Concentration of insurance risk comes from improving longevity.
Improved longevity arises from enhanced medical treatment and improved life circumstances.
Concentration risk is managed by writing business across a wide range of different medical and lifestyle conditions to avoid excessive exposure.
b Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss or of adverse change in the financial situation resulting, directly or indirectly, from fluctuations in the level and in the volatility of market prices of assets, liabilities and financial instruments, together with the impact of changes in interest rates.
Significant market risk is implicit in the insurance business and arises from exposure to interest rate risk, property risk, inflation risk and currency risk.
The Group is not exposed to any equity risk or material currency risk.
Market risk represents both upside and downside impacts but the Groups policy to manage market risk is to limit downside risk.
Falls in the financial markets can reduce the value of pension funds available to purchase Retirement Income products and changes in interest rates can affect the relative attractiveness of Retirement Income products.
Changes in the value of the Groups investment portfolio will also affect the Groups financial position.
In mitigation, Retirement Income product monies are invested to match the asset and liability cash flows as closely as practicable.
In practice it is not possible to eliminate market risk fully as there are inherent uncertainties surrounding many of the assumptions underlying the projected asset and liability cash flows.
For each of the material components of market risk, described in more detail below, the market risk policy sets out the risk appetite and management processes governing how each risk should be measured, managed, monitored and reported.
i Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its impact on the value of, or income from, specific assets, liabilities or both.
It seeks to limit itsexposure through appropriate asset and liability matching and hedging strategies.
The Groups exposure to changes in interest rates is concentrated in the investment portfolio, loans secured by mortgages and its insurance obligations.
Changes in investment and loan values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the value of insurance liabilities.
The Group monitors this exposure through regular reviews of the asset and liability position, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and scenario analyses.
Interest rate risk is also managed using derivative instruments e. g. swaps andswaptions.
The following table indicates the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates for the Groups significant financial assets.

A substantial decline or sustained underperformance in UK residential property prices, against which the Groups lifetime mortgages are secured, could result in proceeds on sale being exceeded by the mortgage debt at the date of redemption.
Demand may also reduce for lifetime mortgage products through reducing consumers propensity to borrow and by reducing the amount they are able to borrow due to reductions in property values and the impact on loan to value limits.
The risk is mitigated by ensuring that the advance represents a low proportion of the propertys value at outset and independent third party valuations are undertaken on each property before initial mortgages are advanced.
Lifetime mortgage contracts are also monitored through dilapidation reviews.
House prices are monitored and the impact of exposure to adverse house prices both regionally and nationally is regularlyreviewed.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of property price movements on profit before tax is included in note 22 e. iii Inflation risk Inflation risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets or liabilities or both in combination, arising from relative or absolute changes in inflation or in the volatility of inflation.
Exposure to inflation occurs in relation to the Groups own management expenses and its matching of index-linked Retirement Income products.
Its impact is managed through the application of disciplined cost control over its management expenses and through matching its index-linked assets and index-linked liabilities for the inflation risk associated with its  Income products.
iv Currency risk Currency risk arises from fluctuations in the value of, or income from, assets denominated in foreign currencies, from relative or absolute changes in foreign exchange rates or in the volatility of exchange rates.
Exposure to currency risk could arise from the Groups investment in non-sterling denominated assets.
From time to time, the Group acquires fixed income securities denominated in US dollars or other foreign currencies for its financial asset portfolio.
All material Group liabilities are in sterling.
As the Group does not wish to introduce foreign exchange risk into its investment portfolio, derivative or quasi-derivative contracts are entered into to eliminate the foreign exchange exposure as far aspossible.
c Credit risk Credit risk arises if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group, including failing to perform them in a timely manner.
Credit risk exposures arise from: Holding fixed income investments where the main risks are default and market risk.
The risk of default where the counterparty fails to pay back the capital and or interest on a corporate bond is mitigated by investing only in higher quality or investment grade assets.
Market risk is the risk of bond prices falling as a result of concerns over the counterparty, or over the market or economy in which the issuing company operates.
This leads to wider spreads the difference between redemption yields and a risk-free return, the impact of which is mitigated through the use of a hold to maturity strategy.
Concentration of credit risk exposures is managed by placing limits on exposures to individual counterparties and limits on exposures to credit rating levels.
The Group also manages credit risk on its corporate bond portfolio through the appointment of specialist fund managers, who execute a diversified investment strategy, investing in investment-grade assets and imposing individual counterparty limits.
Current economic and market conditions are closely monitored, as are spreads on the bond portfolio in comparison with benchmark data.
Counterparties in derivative contracts the Group uses financial instruments to mitigate interest rate and currency risk exposures.
It therefore has credit exposure to various counterparties through which it transacts these instruments, although this is usually mitigated by collateral arrangements see note 26.
Reinsurance reinsurance is used to manage longevity risk but, as a consequence, credit risk exposure arises should a reinsurer fail to meet its claim repayment obligations.
Credit risk on reinsurance balances is mitigated by the reinsurer depositing back more than 100% of premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement.
JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 144 Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued 34 Financial and insurance risk management continued Cash balances credit risk on cash assets is managed by imposing restrictions over the credit ratings of third parties with whom cash is deposited.
Credit risk credit risks for loans secured by mortgages has been considered within property risk above.
The following table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure for financial assets of the Group, which are neither past due nor impaired at 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2015.
The carrying amount of those assets subject to credit risk represents the maximum credit riskexposure.
d Liquidity risk The investment of Retirement Income cash in corporate bonds, gilts and lifetime mortgages, and commitments to pay policyholders and other obligations, requires liquidity risks to be taken.
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss because the Group, although solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to it in order to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
Exposure to liquidity risk arisesfrom: Deterioration in the external environment caused by economic shocks, regulatory changes or reputational damage: realising assets to meet liabilities during stressed market conditions: increasing cash flow volatility in the short term giving rise to mismatches between cash flows from assets and requirements from liabilities: needing to support liquidity requirements for day-to-day operations: ensuring financial support can be provided across the Group: and maintaining and servicing collateral requirements arising from the changes in market value of financial derivatives used by the Group.
Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring that assets of a suitable maturity and marketability are held to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups short-term liquidity requirements are predominantly funded by advance Retirement Income premium payments, investment coupon receipts, and bond principal repayments out of which contractual payments need to be made.
There are significant barriers for policyholders to withdraw funds that have already been paid to the Group in the form of premiums.
Cash outflows associated with Retirement Income liabilities can be reasonably estimated and liquidity can be arranged to meet this expected outflow through asset-liability matching and new businesspremiums.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 145 34 Financial and insurance risk management continued The cash flow characteristics of the lifetime mortgages are reversed when compared with Retirement Income products, with cash flows effectively representing an advance payment, which is eventually funded by repayment of principal plus accrued interest.
Policyholders are able to redeem mortgages, albeit at a cost.
The mortgage assets are considered illiquid, as they are not readily saleable due to the uncertainty about their value and the lack of a market in which to tradethem.
Cash flow forecasts over the short, medium and long terms are regularly prepared to predict and monitor liquidity levels in line with limits set on the minimum amount of liquid assets required.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the financial liabilities, including both principal and interest payments, of the Group based on remaining undiscounted .

The Group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain eligible capital, or Own Funds in excess of the value of their Solvency Capital Requirements SCR.
The SCR represents the risk capital required to be set aside to absorb 1 in 200 year stress tests of each risk type that the JRP Group is exposed to, including longevity risk, property risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk.
These risks are all aggregated with appropriate allowance for diversification benefits.
In December 2015, Just Retirement Group plc and Just Retirement Limited received approval to calculate their Solvency II capital requirements using a full internal model which continued to be used for those parts of the Group at December 2016.
The capital requirement for the ex-Partnership business is assessed using the standard formula.
The surplus of Own Funds over the SCR is called Excess Own Funds and this effectively acts as working capital for the Group.
The over-riding objective of the Solvency II capital framework is to ensure there is sufficient capital within the insurance company to protect policyholders and meet their payments when due.
The Groups capital position can be adversely affected by a number of factors, in particular factors that erode the Groups capital resources and or which impact the quantum of risk to which the Group is exposed.
In addition, any event which erodes current profitability and is expected to reduce future profitability and or make profitability more volatile could impact the Groups capital position, which in turn could have a negative effect on the Groups results of operations.
The Groups objectives when managing capital for all subsidiaries are: To comply with the insurance capital requirements required by the regulators of the insurance markets where the Group operates.
The Groups policy is to manage its capital in line with its risk appetite and in accordance with regulatory requirements: to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing insurance and investment contracts commensurately with the level of risk.
