14 Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, shares are allocated to approximately 1,300 of the groups executive directors, senior managers and middle managers based on a percentage of salary and are subject to performance targets over a three year period.
At 31st March 2016, shares allocated in 2013, 2014 and 2015 at 31st March 2015, shares allocated in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were outstanding in respect of which the performance period has not expired.
The minimum release of 15% of the allocation is subject to the achievement of underlying earnings per share EPS growth of 6% compound per annum over the three year period.
For shares allocated in 2015 onwards, the maximum release of 100% of the allocation is subject to EPS growing by at least 12% compound per annum and for shares allocated prior to 2015, the maximum release is subject to EPS growing by at least 15% compound per annum.
The number of allocated shares released will vary on a straight line basis between these points.
Allocations will lapse if the EPS growth is less than 6% compound per annum over the three year performance period.
Shares allocated in 2014 onwards to the executive directors only are also subject to a deferred release whereby a third is released on the third anniversary of the date of the allocation and the remaining vested shares are released in equal instalments on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the allocation: plus the Remuneration Committee is entitled to claw back the allocations in cases of misstatement or misconduct.
Of the shares allocated in 2012, 15.64% were released during the year.
Share options Prior to 31st March 2007, equity settled share options were granted to employees at the average of the market value of the companys shares over the three days prior to the date of grant and have a maximum life of ten years.
The number of shares over which options were granted was based on a percentage of the employees salary and approximately 800 employees were granted options each year.
Options granted in 2004 to 2006 were subject to a minimum three year performance target of EPS growth of UK RPI plus 3% per annum.
Other performance targets were EPS growth of UK RPI plus 4% per annum and EPS growth of UK RPI plus 5% per annum.
If the performance targets were not met at the end of the three year performance period, the options would lapse.
The targets for options granted in 2004, 2005 and the 3% and 4% targets for options granted in 2006 have been met and so these options are exercisable.
The 5% target for options granted in 2006 was not met and so these options have lapsed.
Gains are capped at 100% of the grant price.
Deferred bonus A proportion of the bonus payable to executive directors and members of the Group Management Committee is awarded as shares and deferred for three years.
The Remuneration Committee is entitled to claw back the deferred element in cases of misstatement or misconduct or other relevant reason as determined by it.
