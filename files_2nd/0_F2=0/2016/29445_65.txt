The effective tax rate on profit before taxation for the year was 26.8% 2015: 18.5%.
The effective tax assessed for the year, all of which arises in the UK, differs from the standard weighted rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The reconciliation of the actual tax charge to that at the domestic corporation tax rate is as follows: million 2016 2015 Profit before taxation 73.2 73.6 Tax at the standard rate of 20% FY2015: 20.25% 14.6 14.9 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.7 3.4 Deferred tax credit on property assets 0.7 Non-taxable profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment 0.1 Disposal of subsidiary company 0.8 Write-off of intangible assets 0.3 Difference in tax rates 5.2 5.8 Reassessment of property timing differences note 4 8.4 Adjustments to prior years 2.0 1.9 Total tax expense 19.6 13.6 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes relate mostly to depreciation on non-qualifying fixed assets, disallowable entertaining and professional fees.
The UK Government has announced a further decrease in the future UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% from April 2020.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax credit arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those liabilities are expected to reverse.
During the year, the Group considered it to be appropriate to reassess the basis for calculating deferred tax on the property portfolio and has now based the assessment on solely held-in-use basis see note 4.
This gives rise to a material tax charge and is excluded from tax on underlying profit.
