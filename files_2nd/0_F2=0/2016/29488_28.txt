Segmental information a. Reportable segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the identification of the Groups operating segments, defined as being discrete components of the Groups operations whose results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker being the Chief Executive to allocate resources to those segments and to assess their performance.
The Group divides its business into the following segments: residential development, being housebuilding activity through St. Modwen Homes and the Persimmon joint venture: and the balance of the Groups portfolio of properties which the Group manages internally, and reports, as a single business segment.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies.

Non-statutory information The purpose of this note is to explain, analyse and reconcile a number of non-statutory financial performance and financial position metrics, which are used extensively by the Group to monitor its performance.
These metrics reflect the way in which the Group is run and in particular that the Group reviews and reports performance of its joint ventures and associates in the same way as it would if they were subsidiaries, meaning that proportionally consolidated see-through measures are particularly relevant whilst also having the benefit of removing the taxation effects on equity accounted entities from the statutory profit before tax figure.
A number of these measures are explained below: Profit before all tax note 2a : This proportionally consolidated measure adjusts profit before tax to remove taxation on joint venture and associate profits from the profit before tax figure and as such, Group profit before tax of 66.9m 2015: 235.2m can be reconciled to profit before all tax of 60.8m 2015: 258.4m by adjusting profit before tax for the tax credit relating to joint ventures and associates of 6.1m 2015: charge of 23.2m.
Trading profit note 2a : Trading profit is derived similarly to profit before all tax, but is stated before the principal non-cash income statement items included in this measure, being revaluation gains and non-cash financing charges.
For a property company with a low depreciation charge and no amortisation, this therefore represents a more useful measure than the EBITDA alternative performance measure used by many other companies.
St. Modwen Properties PLC 122 Annual report and financial statements 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Property profits note 2a : This measure represents proportionally consolidated development profits plus proportionally consolidated gains on disposals of investment properties and therefore, like profit before all tax, ostensibly represents the proportionally consolidated amounts in respect of these two income statement lines, after a historically fide minimis adjustment for net realisable value provisions.
EPRA NAV per share note 2g : Whilst it is a non-GAAP measure, EPRA NAV is a standard real estate measure.
Its objective is to highlight the fair value of net assets on an ongoing, long-term basis.
Assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in normal circumstances such as the fair value of derivative financial instruments and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are therefore excluded, which facilitates a more objective comparison with peer companies.
Total accounting return note 2g : Our shareholders measure their returns in terms of both the Groups growth and the dividend return.
Total accounting return combines these two items by adding EPRA NAV per share defined above to the annual dividend paid per share and measuring this against opening EPRA NAV per share.
Whilst this is often measured by Total Shareholder Return which combines share price growth and dividend return, in the real estate sector, it is also insightful to consider net asset growth, which therefore directly reflects the most recent valuation of assets.
These items are reclassified to investment property revaluation gains.

Gearing and loan-to-value The Groups capacity to borrow is primarily linked to the quantum of the property portfolio excluding assets held under finance leases.
Accordingly both adjusted gearing and loan-to-value are calculated using the comparable measure of net borrowings.
The table overleaf shows the calculation of: gearing, being the ratio of net debt to total equity: adjusted gearing, being the ratio of net borrowings to total equity: loan-to-value, being the ratio of net borrowings to the property portfolio excluding valued assets held as finance leases representing amounts that could be used as security for that debt : and loan-to-value excluding residential land, being the ratio of net borrowings to the property portfolio excluding valued assets held as finance leases and residential land reflecting that residential land is a less attractive asset for security purposes.

Share-based payments The Group has a Save As You Earn share option scheme open to all employees.
Employees must ordinarily remain in service for a period of three or five years from the date of grant before exercising their options.
The option period ends six months following the end of the vesting period.
The Group also operates a discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Options are granted at a fixed price equal to the market price at the date of grant.
With the exception of awards made to executive directors in conjunction with PSP awards granted in 2012, there are no performance conditions attached to ESOS awards.
Employees must ordinarily remain in service for a period of three years from the th date of grant before exercising their ESOS awards.
The option ends on the 10 anniversary of the date of grant.
Details of the Groups Performance Share Plan PSP are given in the Directors remuneration report.
The following table illustrates the movements in share options during the year.
As the PSP includes the grant of options at nil exercise price, the weighted average prices below are calculated including and excluding the options under this plan.

In arriving at fair value it has been assumed that, when vested, share options are exercised in accordance with historical trends.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 2.76 2015: 4.63.
The executive share options outstanding at the year end had a range of exercise prices between 1.78 and 4.75 2015: 1.75 and 4.74 with PSP options exercisable at between nil and 4.71 2015: nil and 4.71.
Outstanding options had a weighted average maximum remaining contractual life of 4.7 years 2015: 5.8 years.

A deferred tax asset of 0.8m 2015: 1.2m has not been recognised in respect of current and prior year tax losses as it is not considered sufficiently certain that there will be taxable profits available in the short-term against which these can be offset.
These unrecognised losses arise predominantly from pre-acquisition activity or within connected parties, which are not able to be group relieved.

St. Modwen Properties PLC 132 Annual report and financial statements 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Income producing properties Income producing properties have been valued using the investment method which involves applying a yield to rental income streams.
Inputs include equivalent yields, current rent and estimated rental value ERV.
The resulting valuations are cross checked against the resulting initial yields and, for certain assets, the land value underpin if the assets were to be redeveloped.
Equivalent yields and ERV are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the aggregate ERV and weighted average equivalent yields used for each category of income producing properties is provided in the following table: Aggregate ERV Average equivalent yield Fair value at High yielding Investment High yielding Investment th 30 November 2016 properties portfolio properties portfolio m m m % % Industrial and logistics 223.7 18.6 6.0 8.7 6.9 Retail 327.9 9.6 17.0 9.0 6.6 Residential and other 149.8 0.8 8.8 9.8 5.4 Total income producing properties 701.4 Aggregate ERV Average equivalent yield Fair value at High yielding Investment High yielding Investment th 30 November 2015 properties portfolio properties portfolio m m m % % Industrial and logistics 202.5 16.2 5.8 8.7 7.8 Retail 310.0 9.2 16.6 9.0 6.6 Residential and other 144.1 0.4 8.3 10.0 5.5 Total income producing properties 656.6 As the Group holds property both directly and through joint ventures and associates the Strategic report discusses yields applied to investment property on a weighted average see-through basis.
This provides a composite position with respect to the Groups exposure to asset types by sector.
The equivalent yield ranges provided above are consistent with those for assets held by the Group together with joint ventures and associates.
The Groups portfolio has a wide spread of yields as it includes assets that are at various stages of the property lifecycle.
Income producing assets are generally acquired at high yields where the Group has the opportunity to add significant value.
As assets are enhanced and development activity is undertaken, improved and new assets are created and valued at lower yields.
All other factors being equal, a higher equivalent yield would lead to an decrease in the valuation of an asset and an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.
However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.
Residential land Residential land is valued using the residual development method.
To derive the value of land the valuers will estimate the gross development value of completed residential units on a site from which deductions will be made for build costs including costs to remediate and service land, finance costs and an appropriate profit margin.
Sales prices, build costs and profit margins are considered to be unobservable inputs and details of the ranges used is provided in the following table: Sales price Build costs Fair value per square foot per square foot Profit margin m % th At 30 November 2016 319.1 144-310 83-110 20.0 th At 30 November 2015 339.8 144-270 82-110 20.0 All other factors being equal, a higher sales price would lead to an increase in the valuation of an asset, a higher profit margin would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset, and a decrease in the build costs would have the effect of increasing the capital value, and vice versa.

The convertible bonds can be converted at any time from 16 April 2014 up to the seventh dealing day before the maturity date.
The initial exchange price was 5.29 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 18,889 ordinary shares for every 100,000 nominal of the convertible bonds.
Under the terms of the convertible bonds, the exchange price is adjusted on the occurrence of certain events including the payment of dividends by the Company in excess of a yield of 1.00% of the average share price in the 90 days th preceding the dividend ex date.
No changes to the exchange price have been made up to 30 November 2016.

Risk management objectives Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt as disclosed in note 14, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in the Groups income or the Groups net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
Interest rate risk is the Groups principal market risk and the Group is exposed to interest rate risk as some of its borrowings are at variable interest rates.
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity, after tax, to a 1% change in interest rates based on year end levels of debt: 2016 2015 1% increase in interest rates m m Interest on borrowings 2.3 2.1 Effect of interest rate swaps 0.4 0.2 Net impact on profit 1.9 1.9 2016 2015 1% decrease in interest rates m m Interest on borrowings 2.3 2.1 Effect of interest rate swaps 0.4 0.2 Net impact on profit 1.9 1.9 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due.
The credit risk on the Groups liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong generally A and above credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 7.2m 2015: 4.0m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 0.6 2015: 0.4m which is provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.
This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
A reconciliation of the changes in this account during the year is provided below: 2016 2015 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts m m At start of year 0.4 0.6 Impairment losses recognised 0.4 0.4 Amounts written off as uncollectable 0.1 0.4 Impairment losses reversed 0.1 0.2 At end of year 0.6 0.4 th Trade and other receivables include 1.5m 2015: 0.8m which are past due as at 30 November 2016 for which no provision has been made because the amounts are considered recoverable.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and through the use of fixed rate bilateral facilities, overdrafts and cash with a range of maturity dates to ensure continuity of funding.
The maturity profile for the cash flows of the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis is as follows: 2016 Less than One to Three months One to More than one month three months to one year five years five years Total m m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts and bonds 0.6 3.5 12.0 533.3 549.4 Trade and other payables 60.3 3.6 32.1 96.0 Finance leases minimum lease payments note 14 0.7 2.0 13.6 163.7 180.0 Other payables on deferred terms 8.7 3.6 12.3 61.6 7.1 54.8 550.5 163.7 837.7 2015 Less than One to Three months One to More than one month three months to one year five years five years Total m m m m m m Bank loans and overdrafts and bonds 1.2 2.7 11.6 452.5 37.5 505.5 Trade and other payables 57.3 5.8 23.3 86.4 Finance leases minimum lease payments note 14 0.7 2.0 13.6 164.2 180.5 Other payables on deferred terms 17.1 3.1 20.2 59.2 8.5 54.0 469.2 201.7 792.6 The Groups approach to cash flow, financing and bank covenants is discussed further in the financial review section of the Strategicreport.

Pensions The Group operates a UK based pension scheme, the St. Modwen Pension Scheme, with both defined benefit and defined contribution st sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1 September 2009, future accrual.
The Group income statement includes the following charges: 2016 2015 m m Defined benefit section 0.3 0.2 Defined contribution section 0.8 0.7 The St. Modwen Pension Scheme is governed by the trustee company, St. Modwen Pensions Ltd.
It is regulated by the UK regulatory regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator.
th The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2014, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 38m and thefunding level was 97% based on the Trustees proposed assumptions for technical provisions.
The main actuarial assumptions were: % per annum Investment rate of return pre-retirement 5.6 Investment rate of return post-retirement 3.8 Increase in pensions 2.7 Funding policy As the scheme is almost fully funded, the current schedule of contributions requires the Group to fund the Scheme to such an extent as to th cover administrative expenses only.
The contribution for year ended 30 November 2017 is expected to be nil, consistent with the current st year contributions of nil.
From 1 January 2015 the administrative expenses were met by St. Modwen Properties PLC.
th The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2016 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Credit Method under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2016 2015 % % Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.40 2.10 Rate of increase in pensions in payment pre 6 April 1997 benefits 2.55 3.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment post 5 April 1997 benefits 3.30 3.10 Discount rate 2.80 3.50 Inflation assumption 2.40 2.10 Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no longer st applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure willbeprotected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from the VITA Tables with CMI 2013 core projections and a long-term improvement of 1% pa with peaked short-term improvements and improvements remaining level at the oldest ages.
The resultant assumptions are, for example: th Average future life expectancy in years for a pensioner aged 65 at 30 November 2016: 23.2 male and 24.0 female.
th Average future life expectancy in years at age 65 for a non-pensioner aged 40 at 30 November 2016: 24.1 male and 26.3 female.

Asset volatility Pension scheme liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields.
If the assets within the scheme deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate this will create or increase a deficit within the scheme.
This risk is reduced by holding a significant proportion of the scheme assets in matching assets bonds or similar.
As the scheme matures, it is anticipated that this proportion will increase to better match the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields will typically increase liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an appreciation in the value of scheme assets held in bonds.
Inflation risk As the pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities.
The asset portfolio includes a significant proportion of inflation linked bonds to reduce this risk.
Member longevity The pension obligations provide benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in liabilities and vice-versa.

Pensions continued Sensitivity analysis th Change in assumptions compared with 30 November 2016 actuarial assumptions: A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 2.1m to 31.5m.
A one-year increase in life expectancy would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.9m to 30.3m.
A 0.5% increase in the inflation rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.4m to 30.8m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in deferred pensions would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 0.2m to 29.6m.
A 0.5% increase in the rate of increase in pensions in payments would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by 1.2m to 30.6m.
Capital commitments th At 30 November 2016 the Group had contracted capital expenditure of 21.6m 2015: 12.2m.
In addition the Groups share of the contracted capital expenditure of its joint venture undertakings was 8.9m 2015: 1.4m.
