Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Note 26 Post-employment benefits Pensions The Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes.
The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Groups employees in the UK now closed tofuture accrual and the Republic of Ireland, and the funded defined contribution pension scheme for employees in the UK.
Of these schemes, theUK defined benefit deficit represents 94% of the Group deficit 2015: 95%.
Defined contribution plans A new defined contribution scheme, Tesco Retirement Savings Plan, was opened on 22 November 2015 and is open to all Tesco employees in the UK.
A defined contribution pension scheme is one under which members pay contributions to an independently administered fund, into which the Group also pays contributions based upon a fixed percentage of the members contributions.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions to this fund once its initial contributions have been paid.
Members benefits upon retirement are then determined by the amount of contributions paid into the fund, together with the performance of the investments into which those contributions have been invested.
Members are able to choose the investments into which their contributions are invested, as well as how they wish to receive benefits upon retirement.
As a result, any risks associated with either the future value of benefits or the performance of the assets invested lie with the member.
The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 175m 2015: 23m have been recognised in the Group Income Statement.
This includes 43m 2015: nil of salaries paid as pension contributions.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme the Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by the Trustee.
The Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed andRules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004, Pensions Act 2014 and all the relevant legislation.
Responsibility for governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustee.
The Trustee is a company whose directors comprise: i representatives of the Group: and ii representatives of the Scheme participants, in accordance with its articles of association and UK pension law.
Willis Towers Watson Limited formerly Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the Scheme as at 31 March 2014, using the projected unit credit method.
At 31 March 2014, the actuarial deficit was 2,751m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 8,020m and these assets represented 75% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions inpayment.
The Scheme has a duration of 24 years.
Closure to future accrual and new members The Career Average section of the Scheme Pension Builder was closed to new members and future accrual on 21 November 2015.
The Final Salary section of the Scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 2001, was also closed to future accrual on 21 November 2015.
As a result of this closure a one off past service credit of 538m and other associated costs of 58 m have been recognised as exceptional items as set out in Note 4.
Scheme liabilities as at 31 March 2014 The table below shows a breakdown of the liabilities held by the Scheme as at 31 March 2014, the date of the last triennial valuation.
As at 27 February 2016, none of the liabilities related to active members, as the Scheme had closed to future accrual.

The rate of increase in salaries and career average benefits are no longer applicable, as the Scheme has closed to future accrual.
UK mortality assumptions The Group conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014, the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: Base tables: 95% of the SAPS S2 normal male pensioners for male staff and 80% of SAPS S2 normal light male pensioners for male senior managers.
100% of the SAPS S2 all female pensioners for female staff and 80% of SAPS S2 all female pensioners for female senior managers.
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 27 February 2016 for the Scheme.
The mortality assumptions used are based on tables that have been projected to 2014 with CMI 2013 improvements.
In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements from 2014 is in line with CMI 2013 with a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the reporting date and a member reaching age 65 at reporting date 25 years.
2016 2015 Years Years Retiring at reporting date at age 65: Male 23.1 23.0 Female 24.5 24.4 Retiring at reporting date 25 years at age 65: Male 25.4 25.3 Female 26.8 26.7 Overseas The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the Republic of Ireland scheme as at 27 February 2016.
At the year end, the deficit relating to the Republic of Ireland was 145m 2015: 168m.
The accounting valuation has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation and updated by Willis Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of the applicable accounting standard in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 27 February 2016.
The schemes assets are stated attheir market values as at 27 February 2016.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.
Risks The Group bears a numbers of risks in relation to the Scheme, which are described below: Investment risk The Schemes accounting liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
If the return on the Schemes assets underperform this rate, the accounting deficit will increase.
The Trustee and the Group regularly monitor the funding position and operate adiversified investment strategy.
Inflation risk The Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
This will be partially offset by an increase in any Scheme assets that are linked to, or correlate with, inflation.
Changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to reduce the Schemes exposure to inflation risk by changing the basis for calculating the rate of increase in pensions to CPI previously RPI.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Schemes liabilities.
However, this may be partially offset by an increase in thecapital value of the Schemes assets that have similar characteristics.
Life expectancy risk The Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and so increases in life expectancy will lead to higher liabilities.
To reduce this risk, changes to future benefits were introduced in June 2012 to increase the age at which members can take their full pension by two years.
The Operations and Audit Pensions Committee formally the Audit & Risk Pensions Committee was established to further strengthen our Trustee Governance and provide greater oversight and stronger internal control over our risks.
Further mitigation of the risks is provided by external advisors and the Trustee who consider the funding position, fund performance, and impacts of any regulatory changes.
A different approach is used to calculate the triennial actuarial liabilities and the accounting liabilities.
The key difference is that the accounting valuation requires the discount rate to be set using corporate bonds whilst the actuarial liabilities discount rate is based on expected returns of Scheme assets.

The method and assumptions used to determine sensitivity and their limitation is the effect of varying the assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
