3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our CSR Policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the local environment, to control our risks and manage our opportunities in a sustainable manner.
Big Yellow has been classified as having a low environmental impact by the Ethical Investment Research Index Series EIRIS because it is involved in Support Services.
Notwithstanding this, and in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for its stakeholders, Big Yellow has continued to commit significant resources to the environmental and social aspects of its storage operations, real estate portfolio, new store developments and site acquisitions.
We report energy use carbon emissions in compliance with the Companies Act and Climate Change Regulation on Reporting Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions for listed companies.
For the detailed application of our report see our Basis of Reporting at: http: corporate.
We therefore provide a summary in the Directors Report of Scope 1 onsite gas, solar electricity generation and refrigerant use and Scope 2 off site power station grid supplied electricity for carbon dioxide equivalent CO e emissions.
We have used the DEFRA DECC Version 2.1 2 2015, Expiry 31 May 2016 conversion factors, for annual GHG emission calculations.
3.1 Energy Use, Efficiency and Reductions from 2011 Peak Energy Benchmark This year we are reporting our key performance indicators and identifying them using the codes from the Global Reporting Initiative GRI and the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA, at the request of some of our stakeholders.
A comparable annual same store portfolio electricity use and carbon emission KPI will also be used.
Our materiality threshold for energy use is 5% and for carbon emissions is 1%.
A limited level of assurance is provided for our Scope 1 and 2 energy use and GHG emissions.
This assurance was undertaken by Deloitte LLP in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 ISAE 3000 Revised.

See page 54 for their independent assurance report.
Note: 2011 was our peak electricity use benchmark 13,925,217 kWh.
This year continuing electricity efficiency programmes have provided an absolute reduction of 32.7% from our peak use in 2011.
Re-lamping with LED, has contributed an extra 2.8% to the annual reduction in 2016.
Note: 2012 was peak gas use benchmark.
Gas use for the heating of our eight flexi offices reached a peak in December 2012, due to the coldest winter month since records began.
The annual reductions in gas use to 2016 have been mainly due to milder but wetter winters.
Flexi-office occupancy variations also reduce heating demand occasionally, but occupancy has been relatively constant, ranging from 82.5% to 87.9%.
This year, gas use reduced by 20.2% from the peak use in 2012.

Note: 2011 was the year of peak energy use 14,581,234 kWh.
Our combined energy use has reduced by 31.6% our from peak energy use in 2011, mainly due to our investment in motion sensor lighting, energy efficient LED re-lamping and 17 roof top solar electricity installations.
Over the last year combined gas and electricity use reduced by 2.7%.
Our gas use materiality is 5.9% of total gas and electricity use and remains just above the materiality level 5%.
This is partly due to significant long term annual reductions in electricity use, compared to reductions achieved in gas use.
As our annual energy use reduced, and customer occupancy increased, energy intensity per occupied space reduced by 55.6% from our peak energy benchmark in 2011.
In the year ended 31 March 2016, energy use per occupied space decreased by 9.4%.
Energy use per gross internal floor area has also reduced by 39.7%, as the portfolio has grown and become more energy efficient.
Energy use intensity per annual revenue decreased by 58.3% from the peak energy benchmark in 2011 and reduced by 16.7% in the year ended 31 March 2016.
3.2 Mandatory Greenhouse Gas GHG Emissions Statement Summary The ISAE 3000 Standard provides an evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of our carbon management.
We report our absolute gross energy use for our wholly owned stores, our head office in Bagshot, and our packing materials warehouse in Maidenhead.
Our environmental report does not include any of the 16 Armadillo stores, in which the Group has a 20% interest.
Our new store openings at Enfield and Cambridge were completed this year.
This year our key performance indicators are identified using GRI and EPRA codes, at the request of some of our stakeholders.
The year ended 31 March 2011 is our peak energy use and carbon emission benchmark year, due to a previous period of increased energy use due to new store openings and increased occupancy.
44 Our combined energy use has reduced by 31.6% from our peak energy use in 2011, mainly due to our investment in motion sensor lighting, energy efficient LED re-lamping and 17 roof top solar electricity installations.
Scope 1 GHG emissions from our real estate portfolio Scope 1 GHG emissions originate from eight on site, natural gas heated flexi office units within our stores.
On site use of refrigerant replacement, for air conditioners in all stores, is also included.
Refrigerant use for cooling store reception areas is only topped up when required.
Note: 2012 was our peak year for gas use and emissions.
Greenhouse gas emissions from gas heating systems have reduced by 20.8% since our peak emission in 2012, the coldest winter since records began England and Wales.
Since 2012 there has been a succession of milder winters and a reduction in gas use of 20.2%.
Flexi Office customer occupancy has remained relatively constant over this time period.

Note: 2014 was the peak year for refrigerant replacement and carbon emissions.
Refrigeration systems are used in air conditioning units for cooling store reception areas and some offices.
Cooling systems are monitored and replacement or top up refrigerant is ordered when required to maintain an efficient working environment.
This year one store area and one office required top up, amounting to a total of 7.3 kg of refrigerant.
This was equivalent to 13.5 tCO e GHG emissions and a significant 2 reduction since our peak refrigerant use in 2014.

45 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued Scope 1 GHG emissions from our real estate portfolio continued Total Scope 1 gas and refrigerant greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 reduced to 122.7 tCO e, similar to the low 2011 emission levels.
2 This represents a 74.2% reduction from our peak use in 2014, due to less heating gas use and less refrigerant top up required in air conditioning units, following significant replacements in 2013 and 2014.
Total Grid Savings Solar kWh payments from energy companies Grid kWh displacement rate of 9p per kWh.
Our onsite roof mounted solar panel generation supplies low carbon electricity to 17 stores and provides an increasing source of energy for the Group.
Solar electricity generation this year was 358,279 kWh: an increase of 14.1% on last years generation.
Big Yellow has generated a total of 1,408,357 kWhs of solar electricity since 2011.
About 30-40% of the solar electricity generated is exported to the National Grid.
Total Feed in Tariff revenue from energy company payments and off grid savings totalled 115,216 this year and has saved 469,994 since 2011.
In 2016, solar electricity generation contributed 3.8 % of our total store electricity use.
Scope 2 Offsite Grid Supplied Electricity Use, GHG Emissions and Tax Reductions Our electricity supply from off site power stations Scope 2 Energy provided around 95% of our total annual energy supplied, in the year ended 31 March 2016.
Grid electricity cost excluding VAT and including CCL Tax 2011, was 0.430 p kWh or 59,878.
Note: 2011 was the peak electricity use 13,925,217 kWh 6,758 tCO e and cost 1,476,266 benchmark for future reductions.
2 Electricity use has reduced by 32.7% and Scope 2 GHG emissions have reduced by 35.9% since our peak electricity use in 2011.
In the last year electricity use has reduced by 2.8% and GHG emissions have reduced by 9.3%.
These reductions are partially due to decreases in the electricity emission factor since last year, our continued investments in energy efficient LED re-lamping and larger capacity roof top solar installations at our new stores.
Our annual average carbon emission reduction over the last five years has been 7.2% per year: double what the commercial property sector requires to meet the UK Governments GHG emissions reduction target of a 34% reduction by 2020 or 3.5% per year to 2050.
Our energy efficiency investment programmes have achieved an electricity cost reduction of 27.3% since 2011.
Although the CCL Tax on electricity has increased from 0.430p kWh 2011 to 0.559p kWh 2016, an increase of 30%, we have managed to reduce our CCL Tax by 12.5% since 2011.

Climate Change Act 2008: Carbon Reduction Commitment CRC Annual Tax Reporting The Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC and the Environment Agency EA are stakeholders in the policy for reducing energy demand from large private sector organisations.
2 Reductions in CRC Tax from 2011 peak energy use.
Note: 2016 CRC emissions and tax will be reported in June 2016.
The CRC Tax on emissions from our use of electricity, gas and self-supplied solar electricity generation rose from 12.00 tCO to 16.40 in 2 2015, and will continue to rise to 18.30 in 2019.
Under the CRC Tax scheme, our total tCO emissions reduced by 28.9%, but our CRC Tax 2 reduction from 2011 to 2015 was 2.9%, due to a 26.8% increase in the 2015 Tax rate.
Big Yellow has further plans to invest in external energy efficient lighting: solar roof top installations and accurate solar performance monitoring to manage costs and savings efficiently, until the merger of the CRC Tax with the Climate Change Levy is confirmed in 2020.
This year we disclose our Scope 2 Off site power station electricity use and emissions, as our most material energy use by Dual Reporting.
This is to compare the difference in our location based National Grid and market based British Gas Electricity supply emissions.
The table below shows that carbon dioxide emissions that are Location Based are almost double the Market Based conversion factor tCO.
2 This is because the British Gas Fuel Mix Disclosure for electricity generation is based on a lower carbon mix of: 33% natural gas: 31% nuclear energy: 23% renewables: 11% coal: and 2% of other fuels.
This disclosure raises consumer awareness of the lower carbon content of market based emissions as well as cost.

47 Strategic Report continued Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued Total Scope 1 and 2 Emissions In the year ended 31 March 2016, total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions achieved a reduction of 35.2% from peak energy use in 2011, exceeding last years 28.7% reduction.
2011 was the Peak emissions and benchmark year for long term performance assessment for Scope 2 These reductions were mainly due to Scope 2 supplied electricity emissions.
Our energy use strategy aims to reduce emissions, annual energy costs and carbon taxation by proportional percentages.
It has also created an income from energy company payments for generation and exporting excess electricity to the Grid from our solar electricity generation investments.
Scope 1 emissions from our stores represent only 2.8% of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
In the year ended 31 March 2016, less refrigerant replacement was required for the third year in succession and the type used had a lower GHG emission conversion factor, resulting in a significant reduction in GHG Emissions from our peak refrigerant replacement in 2015.
GHG emissions from flexi office gas heating are also indicating a constant reduction in tCO e in the year ended 31 March 2016, due to milder but wetter winters since 2012.
2 GHG Emission Intensity Scope 1 and 2 Our key emission intensity indicators are based on annual growth using customer occupancy and revenue and gross internal floor area GIFA.
Note: Peak GHG emissions year is 2011.
From our peak GHG emissions in 2011, emissions per customer occupied space have reduced by 58.0% and by 63.6% per revenue.
GHG emission intensity per our store portfolio gross internal floor area has reduced by 42.9%.
Our future GHG carbon reduction programme is to invest in external LED re-lamping and solar electricity generation investments where viable.
More store specific energy saving opportunity scheme ESOS have also been programmed for future years.
48 Extending our landscaping to green walls and roofs is environmentally beneficial.
These features allow excess rainwater to be absorbed, helps moderate the temperature of the local environment, provides habitat for local wildlife and is more aesthetically appealing softening the landscape.
3.3 Long Term Energy Electricity Management Scope 2 GHG Emission Targets and Reductions The Climate Change Act 2008 has set a national target to reduce GHG emissions by 34% by 2020 and we aim to achieve this target.
As part of the UK commercial property sector, Big Yellow has been reducing its energy use by energy efficient and renewable energy technology since its first electricity peak use in 2008.
2011 peak electricity use due to occupancy growth.
Note: 2008 peak use due to new store development and occupancy growth.
We have been achieving a 4.5% annual average reduction of GHG emissions from 2008 to 2016.
From 2017, we will adopt the UK commercial property sector Real Estate Environmental target of a 3.5% annual GHG emission reduction to align with the Governments 2050 goal.
To achieve this target our future programmes of re-lamping stores externally with energy efficient lighting is planned to begin in the year ending 31 March 2017.
Additional investment in roof mounted solar installations at our new and existing stores is also proposed for the year ending 31 March 2017.
We will also use our Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme ESOS report to implement other energy efficiency investments where we consider they are appropriate.

Certification is required at new store openings, store acquisitions and when solar panels are retrofitted onto older stores.
We have provided 30 EPCs to date in our stores, representing 42% of the portfolio.
Of the stores certified 73% have high A or B ratings, mainly due to energy efficient internal LED re-lamping and investment in low carbon electricity, heating and cooling self-supply, such as solar and ground source heat pump installations.
Considering that the whole portfolio has internal energy efficient LED lighting, apart from a few recent acquisitions, we are comfortable that the pre-October 2008 stores will at least achieve the EPC B rating in the future, when the opportunity arises.
Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology BREEAM BREEAM certification is sometimes a local planning requirement for our stores, especially for new developments in high density urban environments.
The methodology assesses impacts and opportunities for enhancing the design and construction environmental aspects.
The certification includes a review of new store energy, sustainable building materials, water efficiency, waste recycling and ecology.
The review also includes social aspects of the building life include its resource management, health, well-being, modes of transport and pollution reduction.
Our BREEAM ratings are mainly Excellent scoring in the 75 76% range and highest in the areas of land use and ecology: transport: waste: pollution: and energy efficiency.
