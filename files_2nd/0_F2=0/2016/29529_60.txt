Income is recognised from the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins on market making and customer business and fair valuechanges.
Change in policy: In 2016 the Group early adopted the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments requirement to present own credit adjustments within other comprehensive income rather than net trading income.
IFRS 9 does not permit the prior year to be restated.
