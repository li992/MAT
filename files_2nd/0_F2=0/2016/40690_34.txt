112 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 112 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 1: Basis of preparation This section lays out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has been clearly identified in a box.
The financial statements consolidate those of The Unite Group plc, the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not as a group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS and approved by the Directors.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 49.
In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps: and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk.
The Group has prepared cash flow projections three years forward to December 2019 and the Group has sufficient headroom to meet all its commitments.
The Group added 100m to an existing facility during 2016 and this together with existing facilities will be sufficient to fund the Groups commitments over the next three years.
The Group maintains positive relationships with its lending banks and has historically secured new facilities before maturity dates and remained within its covenant levels.
The Group is in full compliance with its covenants at 31 December 2016.
Our debt facilities include loan-to-value, interest cover and minimum net worth covenants, all of which have a high level of headroom.
In order to manage future financial commitments, the Group operate a formal approval process, through its Major Investment Approvals committee, to ensure appropriate review is undertaken before any transactions are agreed.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, investments in subsidiaries and interest rate swaps all of which are stated at their fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has an existing right that gives it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary, has exposure or right to variable returns from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals and management fees, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in value of fixed assets.
Strategic report Corporate governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other information THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 113 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 113 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 1: Basis of preparation continued Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 16 Leases: IFRS 2 amendments Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transaction IAS 7 amendments Disclosure Initiative IAS 12 amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture: The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments, IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures and IFRS 16 will impact the treatment of leases.
During 2016 the Group continued to monitor the potential impact of these changes.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 until a detailed review has been completed.
Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to the financial statements.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: valuation of investment property and investment property under development note 3.1 The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which is as follows: classification of joint venture vehicles note 3.4 114 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 114 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 2: Results for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group and provides a reconciliation between the primary statements and EPRA performance measures.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value per share.
The Group uses EPRA earnings and NAV movement as key comparable indicators across other real estate companies in Europe.

The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 are Operations and Property.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Group therefore has one geographical segment.
2.2 Earnings EPRA earnings amends IFRS measures by removing principally the unrealised investment property valuation gains and losses such that users of the financials are able to see the extent to which dividend payments dividend per share are underpinned by earnings arising from purely operational activity.
The reconciliation between Profit attributable to owners of the parent company and EPRA earnings is available in note 2.2 b.
The Operations segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
The way in which the Operations segment adds value to the business is set out in the Operations review on pages 30 to 33.
The Operations segment is the main contributor to EPRA earnings and EPRA EPS and these are therefore the key indicators which are used by the Board to monitor the Operations business.
The Board does not manage or monitor the Operations segment through the balance sheet and therefore no segmental information for assets and liabilities is provided for the Operations segment.

In the prior year certain hedging relationships were concluded to be ineffective and hence the fair value movement of the swaps designated as hedging instruments in those relationships were recorded within the Income statement rather than Other comprehensive income.
The minority interest share, or non-controlling interest, arises as a result of the Company not owning 100% of the share capital of one of its subsidiaries, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd. More detail is provided in note 3.4.

Basic EPS is adjusted in line with EPRA guidelines in order to allow users to compare the business performance of the Group with other listed real estate companies in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
EPRA EPS and EPRA EPS pre yield related USAF performance fee are calculated using EPRA earnings.

The Group also manages NAV using EPRA NNNAV, which adjusts EPRA NAV to include the fair value of swaps and debt.
Under EPRA best practice guidelines this is considered to give stakeholders the most relevant comparable information on the current fair value of all the assets and liabilities in the Group.
The Net Assets reported under IFRS reconcile to EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV as follows: 2016 2015 Note m m Net asset value reported under IFRS 1,451.6 1,275.1 Mark to market interest rate swaps 14.9 4.3 Deferred tax 5.4 31.9 EPRA NAV pre convertible 2.3a 1,471.9 1,311.3 Convertible bond 85.4 83.1 EPRA NAV 1,557.3 1,394.4 Mark to market of fixed rate debt 19.7 28.0 Mark to market interest rate swaps 14.9 4.3 Deferred tax 5.4 31.9 EPRA NNNAV 1,517.3 1,330.2 d NAV per share Basic NAV is based on the net assets attributable to the equity shareholders of The Unite Group plc and the number of shares in issue at the end of the year.

There were no disposals of properties held as trading properties during 2016 and therefore no revenue was recognised.
During 2015, Stratford One, a trading asset, was sold to LSAV resulting in 77.0m of revenue.
Accounting policies Revenue is recognised on the following bases: Rental income Rental income from property leased out under operating leases comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and commercial tenants is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are sometimes granted on commercial units: these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term of the lease.
Property sales Income relating to the sale of trading properties is recognised once contracts for sale have been unconditionally exchanged.
Management and performance fees The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
In addition, the Group is entitled to performance fees from USAF and LSAV if the joint ventures outperform certain benchmarks.
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the JVs as consideration for the performance fee.
Management and performance fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate as services are provided.
124 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 124 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.5 Tax The Group has not paid any corporation tax in the recent past due to the availability of capital allowances, indexation and brought forward losses.
However, it does pay UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
During the year, the Group elected to become a REIT with effect from 1 January 2017.
As a REIT, rental profits and gains on disposal of investment properties will be exempt from corporation tax.
As a result, no deferred tax provision has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of property assets revaluation and capital allowances, and the provision for deferred tax liability on property business assets of 41.1m at 31 December 2015 has been fully released.
The Groups investments in unit trusts are not exempt from tax as a REIT and, where they remain within the charge to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised as appropriate.
The Group will be able to utilise its tax adjusted losses against gains arising on the disposal of its investments in unit trusts.
As the deferred tax liability on non-property business investments exceeds the asset relating to the losses, the deferred tax asset in respect of the tax adjusted losses has been recognised in full.
a Tax income statement The total taxation charge credit in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2016 2015 m m Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies 2.3 1.6 Current tax charge 2.3 1.6 Reversal of deferred tax provision in respect of REIT property business assets 39.8 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 13.7 27.2 Effect of change in tax rate 1.2 4.1 Recognition of previously unrecognised asset 8.0 Deferred tax charge credit 27.3 31.1 Total tax credit charge in income statement 25.0 32.7 During the year, the Group elected to be taxed as a REIT with effect from 1 January 2017.
As a result of this, the Groups investment properties are exempt from tax and no deferred tax is required on the balance sheet.
Accordingly the Groups deferred tax now only relates to non-property investments being primarily its interests in joint ventures and historic tax losses.
The removal of the deferred tax provision in respect of REIT property business assets is comprised of credits of 29.2m in relation to investment properties and 11.3m in relation to accelerated capital allowances, and a debit of 0.7m for tax adjusted losses extinguished on conversion.
The movement in deferred tax provided is shown in more detail in note 2.5 d below.

Accordingly, the reconciliation above has been calculated at a rate of 20% 2015: 20.25%.
Following the Groups election to become a REIT effective 1 January 2017, deferred tax on its REIT property business assets is no longer required.
Accordingly, the Group has recognised a credit of 39.8m in the Income Statement reversing the provision for deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised at 31 December 2015 relating to the revaluation of investment property, accelerated capital allowances, and property business tax losses.
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment intended to reflect tax that the Group may have to pay in the future if certain events occur, and is distinct from the Groups current tax charge the latter being the tax actually payable to HM Revenue & Customs for the year.
Accordingly, the release of the deferred tax provision is an accounting only adjustment, and does not result in the Group receiving a tax credit or refund.
The current tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2016 is unaffected by the election to become a REIT.
b Tax other comprehensive income Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling 1.6 million 2015: 0.8 million credit has been recognised representing deferred tax.
An analysis of this is included in the deferred tax movement on page 126. c Tax statement of changes in equity Within the statement of changes in equity a tax charge totalling 0.1 million 2015: 0.8 million credit has been recognised representing deferred tax.

This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on the rate at which it is expected to reverse.
Following the Groups election to become a REIT, disposals of investment property will be exempt from tax and as a result no deferred tax liability has been recognised in relation to these assets.
The movement of 41.1m in the year is made up of a combination of in year movement and reversal of the remaining provision.
The Groups investments in property unit trusts being primarily its interests in joint ventures are not exempt from tax as a REIT.
Where the interest in joint ventures remains subject to tax, a deferred tax liability has been recognised on the excess of the market value of these assets over their historic tax base cost.
At 31 December 2016 the deferred tax liability in relation to these investments was 17.2m.
Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary differences of 118.9 million 2015: 104.9 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The performance of the property portfolio whether wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in two groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups EPRA NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Investment property under development fixed assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Investment property on completion.
Accounting policies Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are disclosed in note 4.6a.
Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value.
Completed properties, properties under development and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 6.4% 2015: 6.4%.
The valuation of property assets involves significant judgement and changes to the core assumptions: market conditions, rental income, occupancy and property management costs, could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets.
Valuation process The valuations of the properties are performed twice a year on the basis of valuation reports prepared by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the valuers in the years ending 31 December 2016 and 2015.
The valuations are based on both: Information provided by the Group such as current rents, occupancy, operating costs, terms and conditions of leases and nomination agreements, capital expenditure, etc.
This information is derived from the Groups financial systems and is subject to the Groups overall control environment.
Assumptions and valuation models used by the valuers the assumptions are typically market related, such as yield and discount rates.
These are based on their professional judgement and market observation.
The information provided to the valuers and the assumptions and the valuation models used by the valuers are reviewed by the Property Board and the CFO.
This includes a review of the fair value movements over the year.

Total interest capitalised in investment and development properties at 31 December 2016 was 34.9 million 2015: 35.4 million on a cumulative basis.
Total internal costs relating to construction and development costs of Group properties amount to 51.1 million at 31 December 2016 2015: 49.6 million on a cumulative basis.
Recurring fair value measurement All investment and development properties are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
While completed property and property under development are held at cost in the balance sheet, the Group discloses the fair value of these assets and includes them at fair value in EPRA NAV.
Completed property and property under development fair value measurements are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and their fair value is measured using the same techniques as for investment properties and investment properties under development.

Where the asset is leased to a university, the valuations also reflect the length of the lease, the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between the Group and the lessee, and the markets general perception of the lessees credit worthiness.
The resulting valuations are cross-checked against the initial yields and the capital value per bed derived from actual market transactions.
For development properties, the fair value is usually calculated by estimating the fair value of the completed property using the discounted cash flow method less estimated costs to completion.

Strategic report Corporate governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other information THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 133 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group Accounting policies Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.
USAF and LSAV are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements and Unites role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of joint control following changes to accounting standards IFRS10 involves judgements around a number of significant factors.
These factors include how Unite as fund manager has the ability to direct relevant activities such as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure for refurbishments and funding whether through debt or equity.
This assessment for USAF is complex because of the number of unitholders and how their rights are represented through an Advisory Committee.
For some of the activities it is not clear who has definitive control of the activities, in some scenarios the Group can control, in others the Advisory Committee.
However, for the activities which are considered to have the greatest impact on the returns of USAF, acquisitions and equity financing, it has been determined that the Group and the Advisory Committee has joint power in directing these activities and that on balance, it is appropriate to account for USAF as a joint venture.
The assessment for LSAV is more straightforward because the Group and GIC each own 50% of the joint venture and there is therefore much clearer evidence that control over the key activities is shared by the two parties.
The Group has two joint ventures: Groups share of assets results Legal entity in which Joint venture 2016 2015 Objective Partner Group has interest The UNITE UK Student 24.6% 23.0% Invest and operate Consortium of investors UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund student accommodation Accommodation Fund, USAF throughout the UK a Jersey Unit Trust London Student 50% 50% Develop and operate GIC Real Estate Pte, Ltd LSAV Unit Trust, a Jersey Unit Accommodation Venture student accommodation in Trust and LSAV Holdings Real estate LSAV London Ltd, incorporated in Jersey investment vehicle of the Government of Singapore Part of the Groups interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd, in which there is an external investor.
A minority interest therefore occurs on consolidation of the Groups results representing the external investors share of profits and assets relating to its investment in USAF.
The ordinary shareholders of The Unite Group plc are beneficially interested in 23.0% 2015: 21.4% of USAF.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.
c Transactions with joint ventures The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
The Group receives an enhanced equity interest in the joint ventures as consideration for the performance fee.

Included in the movement in EPRA NAV is a USAF performance fee of 6.5 million 2015: 20.2 million.
This is the gross fee of 8.1 million 2015: 25.6 million paid by USAF net of advisory fee costs of 0.5 million 2015: 2.2 million and a 1.1 million 2015: 3.2 million adjustment related to trading with joint ventures.
The USAF performance fee will be settled in units in The UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund rather than cash.

This includes investment property, investment property under development and swaps at a fair value calculated by a third party expert.
All investment properties and investment properties under development are classified as Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed on page 129.
The fixed rate loans range between Level 1 and Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have been discussed further on page 139.
In addition to the equity investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company has provided a loan with interest chargeable at 6.125% to LDC Holdings plc.

Strategic report Corporate governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other information THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 139 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 139 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and equity.
The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
On 10 October 2013 the Group issued a convertible bond.
The unsecured instrument pays a coupon of 2.5% until 10 October 2018.
In accordance with IFRS, the equity and debt components of the bond are accounted for separately and the fair value of the debt component has been determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
As a result, 80.3 million was recognised as a liability in the balance sheet on issue and the remainder of the proceeds, 9.6 million, which represents the equity component, was credited to reserves.
The difference between the fair value of the liability and the principal value is amortised through the income statement from the date of issue.
Issue costs of 2.0 million were allocated between equity and debt and the element relating to the debt component is being amortised over the life of the bond.
The issue costs apportioned to equity of 0.2 million are not amortised.
The table below analyses the Groups borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 Carrying Carrying Carrying Carrying value value Fair value Fair value value value m m m m m m Current In one year or less, or on demand 1.3 1.2 31.3 31.2 0.1 1.4 Non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 108.1 132.2 1.5 1.4 85.3 In more than two years but not more than five years 126.3 125.8 202.2 240.4 90.0 83.0 In more than five years 239.1 223.0 240.1 225.5 90.0 473.5 481.0 443.8 467.3 175.3 173.0 Total borrowings 474.8 482.2 475.1 498.5 175.4 174.4 In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of 245.0 million 2015: 174.0 million.
A further overdraft facility of 10.0 million 2015: 10.0 million is also available.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans carried at 330.3 million 2015: 331.4 million and the convertible bond carried at 86.2 million 2015: 84.3 million.
The convertible bond and 90.0 million 2015: 90.0 million of the fixed rate loans are classified as Level 1 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and have a fair value of 212.5 million 2015: 218.4 million.
The IFRS 13 Level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from Level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to Level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
The remaining 240.3 million 2015: 241.4 million of the fixed rate loans are classified as Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of these fixed rate loans has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates.
The fair value of these loans is 215.1 million 2015: 226.4 million.
Properties with a carrying value of 998.0 million 2015: 993.6 million have been pledged as security against the Groups drawn down borrowings.
140 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 140 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding continued 4.2 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be commercially effective.
Accounting policies Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group only applies hedge accounting when the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 2016 2015 m m Current Non-current 11.6 2.3 Fair value of interest rate swaps 11.6 2.3 The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates, representing Level 2 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
4.3 Net financing costs Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested both calculated using the effective interest rate method and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Strategic report Corporate governance FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other information THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 141 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 141 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding continued 4.3 Net financing costs continued 2016 2015 Recognised in the income statement: m m Finance income Interest income on deposit 0.1 0.2 Finance income 0.1 0.2 Gross interest expense on loans 26.8 25.3 Interest capitalised 5.9 2.7 Loan interest and similar charges 20.9 22.6 Changes in mark to market of interest rate swaps not accounted for as hedges 0.6 Swap cancellation costs 1.0 Finance costs 21.9 23.2 Net financing costs 21.8 23.0 The average cost of the Groups wholly owned investment debt at 31 December 2016 is 4.4% 2015: 4.7%.
The overall average cost of investment debt on an EPRA basis is 4.2% 2015: 4.5%.
4.4 Gearing The Groups adjusted gearing ratio is a key indicator that the Group uses to manage its indebtedness.
EPRA net asset value NAV and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing.
Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as shown below.
The Groups gearing ratios are calculated as follows: 2016 2015 Note m m Cash and cash equivalents 5.1 42.7 27.0 Current borrowings 4.1 1.3 31.3 Non-current borrowings 4.1 473.5 443.8 Interest rate swaps liabilities 4.2 11.6 2.3 Net debt per balance sheet 443.7 450.4 Mark to market of interest rate swaps 11.6 2.3 Adjusted net debt 432.1 448.1 Reported net asset value attributable to owners of the parent company 2.3c 1,451.6 1,275.1 EPRA net asset value 2.3c 1,557.3 1,394.4 Gearing Basic Net debt Reported net asset value 31% 35% Adjusted gearing Adjusted net debt EPRA net asset value 28% 32% Gearing EPRA net debt EPRA net asset value 2.3a 50% 52% Loan to value EPRA net debt Total property portfolio 2.3a 34% 35% 142 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 142 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding continued 4.5 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is separated into two main areas: i Development and refinancing The Group had no specific development borrowings as at 31 December 2016 2015: nil.
The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
The Groups policy allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
ii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements.
The majority of this floating debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2016, the Groups policy guideline has been to hedge 75% and 95% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 2-10 years.
At 31 December 2016, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 100% 2015: 87% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
Excluding the 92.9 million 2015: 1.7 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 4.6% 2015: 4.6% for an average period of 5 years 2015: 6 years, including these swaps the average rate is 4.2% 2015: 4.6%.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2016 against 92.9 million 2015: 1.7 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 Nominal Applicable Nominal Applicable amount hedged interest rates amount hedged interest rates m % m % Within one year Between one and two years Between two and five years 47.6 1.8 More than five years 45.3 2.2 1.7 5.6 During the year, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.6 million 2015: 0.7 million lower higher.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
For development activities, the Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific facility for the development.
The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ring-fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining until the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

During 2013 the Group issued 89.9m of convertible bonds.
The bonds have a maturity date of 10 October 2018.
Under the terms of the Convertible Bond, early conversion of the debt into equity can be triggered if the share price trades over 1.3 times the conversion price for a period of time.
As at 31 December 2016 this threshold has not been triggered.
This threshold was triggered as at 31 December 2015: the bondholders had the right to exercise until 31 March 2016: no bondholders exercised during this period.
The bondholders may exercise the Conversion Right in certain circumstances discussed above but this is contingent on a number of factors and therefore the bonds are shown to maturity in the above disclosure.
c Covenant compliance Many of the Groups funding facilities carry covenants.
The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an ongoing basis.
At 31 December 2016, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants.
The Group is able to use available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan to value LTV covenants.
The covenant headroom position is outlined below and assumes that the Group is able to use a mixture of available cash and add additional property to banks security pools.

144 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 144 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 4: Funding continued 4.6 Operating leases a Payable Accounting policies Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the property interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised.
The Group has a number of sale and leaseback properties which are accounted for as operating leases.
The total future minimum lease rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases fall due for repayment as follows: 2016 2015 m m Less than one year 13.8 14.7 Between one and five years 56.2 57.2 More than five years 171.0 154.5 Total 241.0 226.4 These leases primarily relate to properties which the group has sold and leased back and on which rental income is earned.
The leases are generally for periods between 13 and 18 years and subject to annual RPI-based rent review.
The total operating lease expenditure incurred during the year was 15.3 million 2015: 15.4 million.
b Receivable The Group accounts for its tenancy contracts offered to commercial and individual tenants as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Less than one year 77.1 85.4 Between one and five years 140.4 124.3 More than five years 267.2 26.7 Total 484.7 236.4 4.7 Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and adjusted net debt, including cash held on deposit.
The Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
The components and calculation of adjusted net debt is set out in note 4.4.
Capital is managed so as to continue as a going concern and to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders and joint venture partners.
The Group uses a number of key metrics to manage its capital structure: adjusted net debt 4.4 adjusted gearing 4.4 LTV 2.3a weighted average cost of investment debt 4.5aii In order to manage levels of adjusted gearing over the medium term, the Group seeks to deliver NAV growth and to recycle capital invested in lower performing assets into new assets and property developments.
132.4 million of property assets were sold in 2016 and we plan to sell an average of 150 200 million of property each year.
The Group targets a yield on cost of approximately 9%.
The Group does not commit to developing new sites until sufficient equity and funding to fulfil the full cost of the development is secure.
The Board monitors the ability of the Group to pay dividends out of available cash and distributable profits.
The Operations Segment generated cash of 61.3 million 2015: 40.8 million during the year, thereby covering the proposed dividend of 40.0 million, 1.5 times 2015: 33.2 million, 1.2 times.

All shares rank equally with regard to the Companys residual assets.
4.9 Dividends Accounting policies Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.
During the year, the Company declared and paid an interim dividend of 13.2 million 6.0p per share 2015: 12.1 million 5.5p per share and paid a 21.0 million final dividend 9.5p per share relating to the year ended 31 December 2015 2014: 19.8 million 9.0p per share.
After the year end, the Directors proposed a final dividend per share of 12.0p 2015: 9.5p, bringing the total dividend per share for the year to 18.0p 2015: 15.0p.
No provision has been made in relation to this dividend.
146 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 146 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 5: Working capital This section focuses on how the Group generates its operating cash flows.
Careful management of working capital is vital to ensure that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
On the following pages you will find disclosures around the Groups cash position and how cash is generated from the Groups trading activities, and disclosures around trade receivables and payables.
5.1 Cash and cash equivalents Accounting policies Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
The Groups cash position at 31 December 2016 was 42.7 million 2015: 27.0 million.
At 31 December 2016 the Company had an overdraft of 0.1 million 2015: overdraft 1.4 million.
The Groups cash balances include 13.4 million 2015: 8.5 million whose use at the balance sheet date is restricted by funding agreements to pay operating costs and loan interest relating to specific properties.
The Group generates cash from its operating activities as follows: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 Note m m m m Profit loss for the year 226.4 355.7 213.8 289.9 Adjustments for: Depreciation and amortisation 3.3 4.4 2.6 Fair value of share based payments 6.1 1.2 2.9 Dividends received 139.3 55.7 Change in value of investment property 3.1 77.2 164.8 Change in value of investments 3.5 77.1 236.3 Net finance costs 4.3 21.8 23.0 0.3 0.3 Profit loss on disposal of investment property 0.4 0.6 Share of joint venture profit 3.4b 94.8 181.8 Trading with joint venture adjustment 7.5 15.5 Tax charge credit 2.5a 25.0 32.7 Cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital 63.9 86.4 2.9 2.4 Increase decrease in trade and other receivables 20.4 39.6 Decrease increase in completed property and property under development 70.1 Decrease increase in inventories 0.7 0.3 Increase decrease in trade and other payables 26.1 3.6 0.3 0.2 Cash flows from operating activities 70.3 120.8 2.6 2.2 25.6 million of the brought forward trade and other receivables was settled in units in USAF rather than cash.
Cash flows consist of the following segmental cash inflows outflows : Operations 61.3 million 2015: 40.8 million, property 6.0 million 2015: 48.3 million and unallocated 39.6 million 2015: 6.9 million.
The unallocated amount includes Group dividends 34.2 million 2015: 31.9 million, tax payable of 2.2 million 2015: 0.3 million, investment in joint ventures nil 2015: 52.4 million, contributions to UNITE Foundation 1.0 million 2015: 1.0 million and amounts received from shares issued 0.3 million 2015: 112.6 million.

Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Board, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows, all trade and other receivables are current.

The Group offers tenancy contracts to commercial Universities and retail unit tenants and individual tenants based on the academic year.
The Group monitors and manages the recoverability of its receivables based on the academic year to which the amounts relate.
Rental income is payable immediately, therefore all receivables relating to tenants are past the payment due date.

148 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 148 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Section 5: Working capital continued 5.2 Trade and other receivables continued Movements in the Groups provision for impairment of trade receivables can be shown as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 2.1 1.7 Impairment charged to income statement in year 0.7 0.4 Receivables written off during the year utilisation of provision 1.4 At 31 December 1.4 2.1 5.3 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It arises principally from the Groups cash balances, the Groups receivables from customers and joint ventures and loans provided to the Groups joint ventures.
At the year end, the Groups exposure to credit risk was as follows: 2016 2015 Note m m Cash 5.1 42.7 27.0 Trade receivables 5.2 17.8 2.3 Amounts due from joint ventures excluding loans that are capital in nature 5.2 36.3 41.7 96.8 71.0 a Cash The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by credit rating agencies and credit default swap rates.
b Trade receivables The Groups customers can be split into two groups i students individuals and ii commercial organisations including Universities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of each customer.
The Group holds tenant deposits of 8.5 million 2015: 7.8 million as collateral against individual customers.
Based on the Groups experience and historical low level of bad debt the Group views these receivables as recoverable balances with a low risk of default.
c Joint ventures Amounts receivable from joint ventures fall into two categories working capital balances and investment loans.
The Group has strong working relationships with its joint venture partners therefore view this as a low credit risk balance.
5.4 Trade and other payables Accounting policies Trade payables are initially recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The carrying value of trade payables is considered approximate to fair value.
Trade and other payables due within one year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Trade payables 16.8 20.7 Retentions on construction contracts for properties 5.8 4.6 Amounts due to group undertakings 1.3 58.2 Other payables and accrued expenses 45.8 52.5 3.0 2.7 Deferred income 55.3 37.7 Trade and other payables 123.7 115.5 4.3 60.9 Other payable and accrued expenses include 8.5 million 2015: 7.8 million in relation to customer deposits.
These will be returned at the end of the tenancy subject to the condition of the accommodation and payment of any outstanding amounts.
Deferred income relates to rental income that has been collected in advance of it being recognised as revenue.
