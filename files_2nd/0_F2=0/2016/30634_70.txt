Vodafone Group Plc Overview Strategy review Performance Governance Financials Additional information Annual Report 2016 Other tax losses The Group has losses amounting to 6,724 million 2015: 6,735 million in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised, in line with the prior year.
The remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group.
There are also 384 million 2015: 310 million of unrecognised other temporary differences.
The Group holds a deferred tax liability of 53 million 2015: 40 million in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date see table above.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 14,106 million 2015: 14,925 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.
