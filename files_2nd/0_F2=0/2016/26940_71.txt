ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 METRO BANK PLC 24.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates or prices of investment securities, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups market risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters to ensure the Groups solvency while optimising the return onrisk.
Investment price risk The Group does not undertake proprietary trading activities and holds primarily high-grade investment securities which have been approved by ALCO.
Management monitors the movements in the Groups investments market value on a regular basis.
In the event of a material detrimental movement in either the value or the credit quality of an asset, ALCO is advised and it is responsible to decide whether to retain or dispose of the asset, in conjunction with the Credit Committee in the case of corporate bonds.
Changes in the value of treasury assets accounted for as available-for-sale AFS are taken to the AFS reserve, and under CRD IV, directly reduce the Groups capital resources where negative.
The table below is a projection of the impact on the market value of AFS securities held at the 2016 year end, of a plus and minus 1.00% and 2.00% parallel shift in the yield curve disregarding any interest rate floors.
Stressed fair values are calculated on the same methodology as the Group uses for calculating current fair values on its AFS investments.

Market risk continued The principal market risk Metro Bank is exposed to is the risk of loss from fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair values of financial instruments because of a change in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps which arise due to differences in the timing of the interest rate repricing of its financial instrument assets and liabilities.
The Group manages this risk by matching the timing of the interest rate repricing to within the Groups interest rate risk appetite.
The Group seeks to do so primarily through the use of natural hedges, but may use derivatives for this purpose from time to time.
Metro Bank manages this risk within a risk appetite framework that is set and approved by the Board.
Risk appetite is set for the market value of equity MVoE and net interest income NII sensitivities for defined stress scenarios.
The position against each limit is reported monthly to the ALCO with exceptions communicated immediately, and noted by the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board.
Interest rate risk Supplementary limits are additionally set to capture any additional interest rate in the Banks balance sheet.
This includes the consideration of movements between LIBOR and the Bank of England base rate.
The tables below set out the interest rate risk repricing gaps of the Banks balance sheet in the specified time buckets, indicating how much of each type of asset and liability reprices in the indicated periods.
A positive gap position tends to benefit net interest income in an environment where interest rates are rising: however, the actual effect will depend on a number of factors including actual repayment dates and interest rate sensitivities within the banding periods.
The converse is true for a negative interest rate sensitivity gap.
