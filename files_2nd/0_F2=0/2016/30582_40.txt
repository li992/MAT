the carrying value, an impairment review is performed utilising the discounted cash flow methodology discussed in note 12.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised for territories where the Group considers that it is probable there would be sufficient taxable profits The Groups investments in its principal associate undertakings are for the future deductions to be utilised.
Based on available evidence, both positive and negative, we determine whether it is probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realised.
The main factors that we consider include: t he future earnings potential determined through the use of internal forecasts: the cumulative losses in recent years: the various jurisdictions in which the potential deferred tax assets arise: the history of losses carried forward and other tax assets expiring: the timing of future reversal of taxable temporary differences: the expiry period associated with the deferred tax assets: and t he nature of the income that can be used to realise the deferred tax asset.
If it is probable that some portion of these assets will not be realised, then no asset is recognised in relation to that portion.
If market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations, our existing recognised deferred tax assets may be adjusted, resulting in future tax benefits.
Alternatively, if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected, future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realisable.
As a result, all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may need to be reversed.

of sterling would have an equal and opposite effect.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into at 31 December 2016 is estimated to be a net asset of approximately 17.0 million 2015: Interest rate risk 37.4 million.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent A one percentage point increase in market interest rates for all currencies instruments at the balance sheet date, comprising 20.0 million in which the Group had cash and borrowings at 31 December 2016 2015: 39.7 million assets included in trade and other receivables would increase profit before tax by approximately 4.5 million 2015: and 3.0 million 2015: 2.3 million liabilities included in trade and 7.9 million.

have an equal and opposite effect.
This has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Groups variable rate cash and borrowings.
Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps amounted to a loss of 5.2 million 2015: loss of 6.8 million, 25.
Financial instruments 2014: gain of 5.3 million which is included in the revaluation of financial instruments for the year.
This loss resulted from a 19.3 million loss on Currency derivatives hedging instruments and a 14.1 million gain on hedged items.
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows and the exchange risk arising on translation of the Groups investments in foreign operations.
The Group is a party to a variety of foreign currency derivatives in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
During 2016, the Group held no currency derivatives.
In 2015, the amounts taken to and deferred in equity during the year for currency derivatives that are designated and effective hedges was a charge of 73.5 million for cash flow hedges.
In 2015 and 2014, changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the currency derivatives amounted to a gain of 3.2 million and 23.0 million respectively which is included in the revaluation of financial instruments for the year.
The Group designates its foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments against the currency risk associated with the translation of its foreign operations.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedges was 122.0 million 2015: 86.5 million.
The Group estimates the fair value of these contracts to be a net asset of 0.1 million 2015: 3.9 million.
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposure and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.

At 31 December 2016, the weighted average growth rate in estimating future financial performance was 25.0% 2015: 20.3%, which reflects the prevalence of recent acquisitions in the faster-growing markets and new media sectors.
The risk adjusted discount rate applied to these obligations at 31 December 2016 was 1.5% 2015: 1.7%.
A one percentage point increase or decrease in the growth rate in estimated future financial performance would increase or decrease the combined liabilities due to earnout agreements and put options by approximately 13.4 million 2015: 11.9 million and 17.9 million 2015: 19.0 million, respectively.

An increase in the liability would result in a loss in the revaluation of financial instruments, while a decrease would result in a gain.
