Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 129 6 Pension schemes Accounting policy The expense of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement employee benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method and charged in the income statement as an operating expense, based on actuarial assumptions reflecting market conditions at the beginning of the financial year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs and credits are recognised immediately at the earlier of when plan amendments or curtailments occur and when related restructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised.
Settlements are recognised when they occur.
Net pension obligations in respect of defined benefit schemes are included in the statement of financial position at the present value of scheme liabilities, less the fair value of scheme assets.
Where schemes are in surplus, i. e. assets exceed liabilities, the net pension assets are separately included in the statement of financial position.
Any net pension asset is limited to the extent that the asset is recoverable.
The expense of defined contribution pension schemes and other employee benefits is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty At 31 December 2016, the Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US.
These schemes require management to exercise judgement in estimating the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, especially given the length of each schemes liabilities.
Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes involves judgement about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation, the future operation of each scheme and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates for these factors are used in determining the pension cost and liabilities reported in the financial statements.
The estimates made around future developments of each of the critical assumptions are made in conjunction with independent actuaries, and each scheme is subject to a periodic review by independent actuaries.
Information regarding some of the assumptions used for valuation is provided below, together with a sensitivity analysis.
A number of pension schemes are operated around the world.
The largest defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2016 are in the UK and the US.
In November 2015, the Netherlands defined benefit pension scheme together with all associated assets and liabilities, was transferred into an industry-wide collective defined contribution scheme.
This scheme is now accounted for as a defined contribution pension plan, with no deficit or surplus recognised on the balance sheet.
Prior to this, the scheme was a career average salary scheme and was open to new hires.
Major defined benefit schemes in place at 31 December 2016 The UK scheme is a final salary scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members accrue a portion of their final pensionable earnings based on the number of years of service.
The US scheme is a cash balance scheme and is closed to new hires.
Members earn pay credits dependent on age and years of service up to certain limits which are added to an account balance that accrues interest at specified minimum rates.
Each of the major defined benefit schemes is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group.
The trustees ofthe pension funds in the UK and plan fiduciaries of the US scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the funds beneficiaries.
In the UK, the trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
The board of trustees consists of an equal number of company-appointed and member nominated Directors.
In the US, the fiduciary duties for the scheme are allocated between committees which are staffed by senior employees of the Group: the investment committee has the primary responsibility for the investment and management of plan assets.
The funding of the Groups major schemes reflects the different rules within each jurisdiction.
In the UK the level of funding is determined by statutory triennial actuarial valuations in accordance with pensions legislation.
Where the scheme falls below 100% funded status, the Group and the scheme trustees must agree on how the deficit is to be remedied.
The UK Pensions Regulator has significant powers and sets out in codes and guidance the parameters for scheme funding.
The US scheme has an annual statutory valuation which forms the basis for establishing the employer contribution each year subject to ERISA and IRS minimums.
Should the statutory funded status fall to below 100%, the US Pension Protection Act requires the deficit to be rectified with additional contributions over a seven-year period.
Employer cash contributions to defined benefit pension schemes, in respect of 2017, are expected to be approximately 66m.
Apension deficit funding contribution of 20m is also expected to be made in 2017, relating to the UK scheme recovery plan.
In addition to the contributions set out above, the Group has committed to providing a further 130m of deficit funding contributions to the UK scheme over the period from 2018 to 2022.

Service cost, including settlements and past service credits, is presented within operating profit.
Settlements and past service credits in 2015 primarily relate to the transfer of the Netherlands scheme to a collective industry-wide scheme.
The significant valuation assumptions, determined for each major scheme in conjunction with the respective independent actuaries arepresented below.
The net defined benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31December of the prior year.
Mortality assumptions make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics.

The difference in assets and liabilities transferred resulted in a settlement credit of 29m in 2015.
In addition to the settlement credit, past service credits of 31m were recognised on transfer of the Netherlands pension scheme, which resulted in a settlement and past service credit of 60m in total.
In 2016, the settlement relates to an annuity purchase in the US.
As at 31 December 2016, the defined benefit obligations comprised 4,760m 2015: 3,849m in relation to funded schemes and 243m 2015:195m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 20 years in the UK 2015: 20 years and 13 years in the US 2015:14years.
Deferred tax assets of 145m 2015: 103m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme deficits.

In particular, adverse changes to asset values, discount rates or inflation could increase future pension costs and funding requirements.
Typically the Groups schemes are exposed to: investment risks, whereby actual rates of return on plan assets may be below those rates used to determine the defined benefit obligations and interest rate risks, whereby scheme deficits may increase if bond yields in the UK and the US decline and are not offset by returns in government and corporate bond portfolios.
The schemes are also exposed to other risks, such as unanticipated future increases in: member longevity patterns, inflation, and future salaries, all potentially leading to an increase in scheme liabilities.
Investment policies of each scheme are intended to ensure continuous payment of defined benefit pensions in the short-term and long-term.
Efforts are made to limit risks on marketable securities by adopting investment policies that diversify assets across geographies and among equities, government and corporate bonds, property funds and cash.
Asset allocations are dependent on avariety of factors including the duration of scheme liabilities and the statutory funded status of the plan.
All equities and government and corporate bonds have quoted prices in active markets.
Sensitivity analysis The valuation of the Groups pension scheme liabilities involves significant actuarial assumptions, being the life expectancy of the members, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies that are reasonably possible would have the following approximate effects on the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: 225 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: 135 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: 178 The above analysis has been calculated on the same basis used to determine the defined benefit obligation recognised in the statement of financial position.
There has been no change in the methods used to prepare the analysis compared with prior years.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in the above assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
