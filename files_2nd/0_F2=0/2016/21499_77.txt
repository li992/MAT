Earnings on American Depositary Shares represent twice the earnings for BHP Billiton ordinary shares.
Recognition and measurement Diluted earnings attributable to owners of the BHP Billiton Group are equal to the earnings attributable to owners of the BHP Billiton Group.
The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and the BHP Billiton Limited Employee Equity Trust.
