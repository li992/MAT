British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 129 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2 Performance measures Earnings per share The Group measures financial performance with reference to underlying earnings per share, the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA earnings per share and IFRS earnings per share.
The relevant earnings and weighted average number of shares including dilution adjustments for each performance measure are shown below, and a reconciliation between these is shown within the supplementary disclosures Table B on page 179.
EPRA earnings per share is calculated using EPRA earnings, which is the IFRS profit after taxation attributable to shareholders of the Company excluding investment and development property revaluations, gains losses on investing and trading property disposals, changes in the fair value of financial instruments and associated close-out costs and their related taxation.
EPRA earnings diluted also takes into account dilution due to the 2012 convertible bond.
Underlying earnings per share is calculated using Underlying Profit adjusted for underlying taxation see note 7.
Underlying Profit is the pre-tax EPRA earnings measure, with additional Company adjustments.
No Company adjustments were made in either the current or prior year.
For the year ended 31 March 2015 the 2012 convertible bond was not dilutive for underlying earnings, as the contingent conditions associated to the bond had not been met.
The convertible conditions period ended on 25 September 2015 and therefore the bond was treated as dilutive in the current year.

9 Pensions The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal defined benefit pension scheme in the Group.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not contracted out of SERPS State EarningsRelated Pension Scheme and it is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
The Group has three other small defined benefit pension schemes.
There is also a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary for non-Directors and paid by the Company.
The total net pension cost charged for the year was 7m 2014 15: 6m, of which 4m 2014 15: 3m relates to defined contribution plans and 3m 2014 15: 3m relates to the current service cost of the defined benefit schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2012 by consulting actuaries, AON Hewitt Associates Ltd.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 54.4% per annum of basic salaries.
The best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2017 is 3m.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 3.2 3.1 4.4 4.1 4.6 Salary inflation 4.8 4.8 5.2 4.7 4.7 Pensions increase 3.2 3.2 3.5 3.1 3.1 Price inflation 3.3 3.3 3.7 3.2 3.2 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 29.7 years if they are male and for a further 31.5 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2036 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 31.6 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 33.1 years after retirement if they are female.

The scheme holds a significant portion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which, although expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 135 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 9 Pensions continued Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
These levels are specified in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Property valuations are inherently subjective as they are made on the basis of assumptions made by the valuer which may not prove to be accurate.
For these reasons, and consistent with EPRAs guidance, we have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13.
The unobservable inputs to the valuations are analysed in the table on the following page.
The Groups total property portfolio was valued by independent external valuers on the basis of fair value, in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014, ninth edition, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The information provided to the valuers, and the assumptions and valuations models used by the valuers are reviewed by the property portfolio team, the Head of Offices, the Head of Retail and the Chief Financial Officer.
The valuers meet with the external auditors and also present directly to the Audit Committee at the interim and year end review of results.
Further details of the Audit Committees responsibilities in relation to valuations can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 80 to 83.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 137 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 10 Property continued Investment properties, excluding properties held for development, are valued by adopting the investment method of valuation.
This approach involves applying capitalisation yields to current and future rental streams net of income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods and associated running costs.
These capitalisation yields and future rental values are based on comparable property and leasing transactions in the market using the valuers professional judgement and market observation.
Other factors taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details and ground and structural conditions.
In the case of ongoing developments, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above, with a deduction for all costs necessary to complete the development, including a notional finance cost, together with a further allowance for remaining risk.
Properties held for development are generally valued by adopting the higher of the residual method of valuation, allowing for all associated risks, or the investment method of valuation for the existing asset.
Copies of the valuation certificates of Knight Frank LLP and CBRE can be found at www.
com reports Within their valuation report, CBRE have highlighted that they expect considerable uncertainty to arise if there is a decision for the UK to exit the EU following the referendum on 23 June 2016 and that this has the potential to reduce investment volumes and liquidity.
This is a forward-looking statement which has no impact on the valuations as at 31 March 2016.

138 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 10 Property continued All other factors being equal: a higher equivalent yield or discount rate would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset: an increase in the current or estimated future rental stream would have the effect of increasing the capital value: and an increase in the costs to complete would lead to a decrease in the valuation of an asset.
However, there are interrelationships between the unobservable inputs which are partially determined by market conditions, which would impact on these changes.
There were no transfers between valuation levels in the period.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at the tax rate effective in the period that the tax is expected to crystallise.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset calculated at 18% 2014 2015: 20% of 6m 2014 2015: nil in respect of capital losses from previous years available for offset against future capital profit.
Further unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of capital losses of 60m 2014 2015: 87m exist at 31 March 2016.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets on derivative revaluations to the extent that future matching taxable profits are expected to arise.
At 31 March 2016, the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset calculated at 18% 2014 2015: 20% of 51m 2014 2015: 38m in respect of UK revenue tax losses from previous years.

152 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 Net debt continued Capital risk management The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Risks relating to capital structure are addressed within managing risk in delivering our strategy on pages 57 to 63.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing debt are set out in the financial policies and principles on pages 54 to 56.
Interest rate risk management The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2016, the fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of 136m.
Interest rate swaps with a fair value of 137m have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2016 was nil 2014 15: nil.
The cash flows occur and are charged to profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises variable rate debt and foreign currency denominated debt hedged at 31 March 2016.
Cash flow hedged debt 2016 2015 m m Outstanding: at one year 413 1,138 at two years 663 538 at five years 250 450 at ten years 250 250 Fair value hedged debt The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2016, the fair value of these derivatives is a net asset of 166m.
Interest rate swaps with a fair value of 164m have been designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39 2014 15: asset of 133m.
The cross currency swaps of the 2018 2021 2023 2026 US Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating rate of 146 basis points above LIBOR.
These have been designated as fair value hedges of the US Private Placements.

At 31 March 2016 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 3.5% 2014 15: 4.8%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 9.1 years 2014 15: 7.1 years.
The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Companys choosing at the relevant LIBOR or similar rate.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 66% at 31 March 2016 on a spot basis.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest as an average over the next five-year forecast period, on a proportionally consolidated basis, was 60% at 31 March 2016.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile, at the balance sheet date, a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 72m 2014 15: 53m decrease.
Similarly, a 59 bps reduction would increase profits by 7m 2014 15: 5m increase.
The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month Sterling LIBOR over the last ten years.
The impact assumes LIBOR does not fall below 0%.
British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 153 Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 17 Net debt continued Interest rate profile including effect of derivatives continued Upward movements in medium and long term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
The majority of the Groups interest rate swaps which provide such protection qualify as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 therefore movements in the fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the seven-year Sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
At 31 March 2016 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of these interest rate swaps by 151m 2014 5: 151m.
A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of these interest rate swaps by 197m 2014 15: 155m.
Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
The 1.5% 2012 Convertible Bond and 0% 2015 Convertible Bond are both designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Principal components of the market value of both bonds include British Lands share price and its volatility, and market interest rates.
The fair value of the 1.5% 2012 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2016 was a 445m liability.
At 31 March 2016 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value liability by 13m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by 14m.
The fair value of the 0% 2015 Convertible Bond at 31 March 2016 was a 334m liability.
At 31 March 2016 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in interest rates would reduce the fair value liability by 27m, and a 204 bps downward shift in interest rates would increase the fair value liability by 30m.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Contingent tax on overseas investments not expected to occur is ignored for hedging purposes, as is the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
Based on the 31March 2016 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a nil change 2014 15: nil in reported profits.
Assets Liabilities 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Euro denominated 10 39 10 39 Credit risk management The Groups approach to credit risk management of counterparties is referred to in the financial policies and principles on pages 54 to 56 and the risks addressed within managing risk in delivering our strategy on pages 57 to 63.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Cash and short term deposits at 31 March 2016 amounted to 114m 2014 15: 108m.
Deposits and interest rate deposits were placed with financial institutions with BBB or better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2016, the fair value of all interest rate derivative assets was 167m 2014 15: 139m.
At 31 March 2016, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and derivatives was 85m 2014 15: 59m.
This represents 0.6% 2014 15: 0.5% of gross assets.
The deposit exposures are with UK banks and UK branches of international banks.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 13.
Provisions are made taking account historic credit losses and the creditworthiness of debtors.
Liquidity risk management The Groups approach to liquidity risk management is discussed in the financial policies and principles on pages 54 to 56, and the risks addressed within managing risk in delivering our strategy on pages 57 to 63.
The following table presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
154 British Land Annual Report and Accounts 2016 17 Net debt continued Liquidity risk management continued The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of nine years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases is also shown in the table below.
Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.
Any short term liquidity gap between the net payments required and the rentals receivable can be met through other liquidity sources available to the Group.
The Group currently holds cash and short term deposits of 114m of which 93m is not subject to a security interest see footnote 5 to net debt table on page 147.
Further liquidity can be achieved through sales of property assets or investments and debt refinancings.
The Groups property portfolio is valued externally at 10,111m and the share of joint ventures and funds property is valued at 4,937m.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group are a further source of liquidity.
The maturity profile of committed undrawn borrowing facilities is shown overleaf.
