Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Basis of Preparation General Information JD Sports Fashion Plc, the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The financial statements for the 52 week period ended 30 January 2016 represent those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 13 April 2016.
Basis of Preparation European Union law EU LAW IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002 requires that the financial statements of the Group are prepared and approved in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the requirements of adopted IFRSs that are endorsed by the EU and effective at 30 January 2016.
The Company has chosen to present its own results under adopted IFRSs and by publishing the Company Financial Statements here, with the Group Financial Statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through the Consolidated Income Statement and also put options held by the non-controlling interests.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The accounting policies set out below have unless otherwise stated been applied consistently to all periods present in these financial statements and have been applied consistently by all Group entities.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Executive Chairmans Statement and Financial and Risk Review on pages 47 and 54 respectively.
In addition, details of financial instruments and exposures to interest rate, foreign currency, credit and liquidity risks are outlined in note 23.
As at 30 January 2016, the Group had net cash balances of 209,421,000 2015: 84,230,000 with available committed borrowing facilities of 215,000,000 2015: 155,000,000 of which nil 2015: 31,000,000 has been drawn down see note 22.
With a facility of 215,000,000 available, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Adoption of New and Revised Standards The following amendments to accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, have been adopted for the first time by the Group in the period with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position: Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2010 2012 Cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2011 2013 Cycle Financial Statements Not Notes t es to the C o the Consolida onsolidat ted Financial S ed Financial Sta tat tements ements c continued ontinued 1.
Basis of Preparation continued A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the 52 week period ended 30 January 2016 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is expected to be applicable after 1 January 2018.
If endorsed, this standard will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but it is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases is expected to be applicable after 1 January 2019.
If endorsed, this standard will significantly affect the presentation of the Group financial statements with all leases apart from short term leases being recognised as on-balance sheet finance leases with a corresponding liability being the present value of lease payments.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future reporting periods.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are considered to be the impairment of goodwill and intangibles due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows and inventory due to the seasonal nature of the Groups retail businesses and the judgement required in assessing the recoverability of its carrying value.
These are discussed further below: I. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination from which goodwill arose.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cashgenerating units, being portfolios of stores or individual businesses.
The cash-generating units used to monitor goodwill and test it for impairment are therefore the store portfolios and individual businesses rather than individual stores, as the cash flows of individual stores are not considered to be independent.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the value-in-use and the fair value less the costs to sell.
The recoverable amounts of these cash-generating units are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
See note 14 for further disclosure on impairment of goodwill and review of the key assumptions used.
Impairment of Other Intangible Assets with Definite Lives The Group is required to test whether other intangible assets with a definite useful economic life have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount of brand names is based on an estimation of future sales and the choice of a suitable royalty and discount rate in order to calculate the present value, when this method is deemed the most appropriate.
Alternatively the carrying value of the brand names has been allocated to a cash-generating unit, along with the relevant goodwill and fascia names, and tested in the value-in-use calculation performed for that cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount of brand licences is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit until the licence expiry date and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Note 14 provides further disclosure on impairment of other intangible assets with definite lives, including review of the key assumptions used.

Basis of Preparation continued III.
Impairment of Other Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives The Group is required to test whether other intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount of these assets is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Note 14 provides further detail of the judgements made by the Board in determining that the lives of acquired fascia names are indefinite and further disclosure on impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite lives, including review of the key assumptions used.
Pr ovisions to Write Inventories Down to Net Realisable Value The Group makes provisions for obsolescence, mark downs and shrinkage based on historical experiences, the quality of the current season buy, market trends and management estimates of future events.
Other Accounting Estimates and Judgements I. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Non-current Other Assets Property, plant and equipment and non-current other assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is not recoverable.
A cash-generating unit is an individual store.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting period date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would be held net of depreciation if no impairment had been realised.
Onerous Property Lease Provisions The Group makes a provision for onerous property leases on specific stores based on the anticipated future cash outflows relating to the contractual lease cost less potential sublease income.
The estimation of sublease income is based on historical experience and knowledge of the retail property market in the area around each specific property.
Significant assumptions and judgements are used in making these estimates and changes in assumptions and future events could cause the value of these provisions to change.
This would include sublet premises becoming vacant, the liquidation of an assignee resulting in a property reverting to the Group or closing an uneconomic store and subletting at below contracted rent.
Value of Put Options Held by Non-controlling Interest The Group recognises put options over non-controlling interests in its subsidiary undertakings as a liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the put option.
The present value of the non-controlling interests put options are estimated based on expected earnings in Board-approved forecasts and the choice of a suitable discount rate.
Upon initial recognition a corresponding entry is made to other equity.
For subsequent changes on remeasurement of the liability the corresponding entry is made to the Income Statement.
Es timation of Useful Economic Lives of Brand Names The Group amortises brand names over their useful economic life.
In determining the useful economic life of each brand name, the Board considers the market position of the brands acquired, the nature of the market that the brands operate in, typical product life cycles of brands and the useful economic lives of similar assets that are used in comparable ways.
V. Determination of Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities on Acquisition For each acquisition, the Group reviews the appropriateness of the book values of the assets and liabilities acquired, taking into account the application of Group accounting policies, to determine if fair value adjustments are required.
The key judgements involved are the identification and valuation of intangible assets which require the estimation of future cash flows based on the Boards strategic plans for the intangible asset, the useful economic life of the intangible asset and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
Segmental Analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires the Groups segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Executive Chairman of JD Sports Fashion Plc.
Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Segmental Analysis continued Information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker is focused on the nature of the businesses within the Group.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: Sports Fashion includes the results of JD Sports Fashion Plc, John David Sports Fashion Ireland Limited, Spodis SA, Champion Sports Ireland, JD Sprinter Holdings 2010 SL including subsidiary companies, JD Sports Fashion BV, JD Sports Fashion Germany GmbH, JD Sports Fashion SRL, JD Sports Fashion Belgium BVBA, JD Sports Fashion Sweden AB, JD Sports Fashion Denmark ApS, JD Sports Fashion SDN BHD, Size GmbH, ActivInstinct Limited, JD Gyms Limited, Duffer of St George Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Kooga Rugby Limited, Focus Brands Limited including subsidiary companies, Kukri Sports Limited including global subsidiary companies, Source Lab Limited, R. D. Scott Limited, Tessuti Group Limited including subsidiary companies, Nicholas Deakins Limited, Cloggs Online Limited, Ark Fashion Limited and Mainline Menswear Limited.
Outdoor includes the results of Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited and Tiso Group Limited including subsidiary companies.
Activinstinct Limited is now included in the Sports Fashion segment reflecting the fact that there has been a restructure of the business in the year and the website is now held on a different platform more closely aligned with the Groups other Sports Fashion businesses than with the businesses classified as Outdoor.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker receives and reviews segmental operating profit.
Certain central administrative costs including Group Directors salaries are included within the Groups core Sports Fashion result.
This is consistent with the results as reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure of information regarding revenue from major products and customers.
The majority of the Groups revenue is derived from the retail of a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories to the general public.
As such, the disclosure of revenues from major customers is not appropriate.
Disclosure of revenue from major product groups is not provided at this time due to the cost involved to develop a reliable product split on a same category basis across all companies in the Group.
Intersegment transactions are undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arms length terms.
The Board consider that certain items are cross divisional in nature and cannot be allocated between the segments on a meaningful basis.
Net funding costs and taxation are treated as unallocated reflecting the nature of the Groups syndicated borrowing facilities and its tax group.
Drawdowns from the Groups syndicated borrowing facility of nil 2015: 31,000,000, a deferred tax asset of 482,000 2015: liability of 1,804,000 and an income tax liability of 15,757,000 2015: 12,931,000 are included within the unallocated segment.
Each segment is shown net of intercompany transactions and balances within that segment.
The eliminations remove intercompany transactions and balances between different segments which primarily relate to the net down of long term loans and short term working capital funding provided by JD Sports Fashion Plc within Sports Fashion to other companies in the Group, and intercompany trading between companies in different segments.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
In the case of goods sold through the retail stores and trading websites, revenue is recognised when goods are sold and the title has passed, less provision for returns.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the sale.
Retail sales are usually in cash, by debit card or by credit card.
Wholesale revenue is recognised when goods are dispatched and the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer.
In some instances, goods are sold with a right of return.
Where wholesale goods are sold with a right of return, a provision is made to estimate the expected level of returns based on accumulated experience and historical rates.
Wholesale sales are either settled by cash received in advance of the goods being dispatched or made on agreed credit terms.

Current Income Tax Current income tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, adjusted for any tax paid in respect of prior years.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: Goodwill not deductible for tax purposes The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which: represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations: is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation has been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
On 25 November 2014 the Group disposed of its 100% shareholding in Bank Fashion Limited to Huk 57 Limited a subsidiary of Hilco Capital Limited.
Bank Fashion Limited has been treated as a discontinued operation as at 31 January 2015 as its fashionwear business offering represented a significant line of business.

Earnings Per Ordinary Share Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Ordinary Share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share at 30 January 2016 is based on the profit from continuing operations for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent of 97,634,000 2015: 68,461,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 52 week period ended 30 January 2016 of 194,646,632 2015: 194,646,632.
An Ordinary Resolution was passed at the Annual General Meeting, effective 30 June 2014, resulting in a share split whereby four ordinary shares were issued for each ordinary share.
In accordance with IAS 33, the number of shares outstanding before the event has been adjusted for the proportionate change as if the event had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Acquisitions Business Combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the returns through its power over the entity.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired.
Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and the settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Current Period Acquisitions During the period, the Group has increased its shareholding in three non-wholly owned subsidiaries.
These transactions were not material.
Prior Period Acquisitions Mainline Menswear Limited On 21 March 2014, the Group acquired 80% of the issued share capital of Mainline Menswear Holdings Limited for cash consideration of 10,924,000 with additional consideration of up to 500,000 payable after 30 November 2014 if certain performance criteria were achieved.
At acquisition, management believed that Mainline Menswear was on course to meet the performance criteria for the maximum contingent consideration to be payable and therefore the fair value of this contingent consideration at this time was 500,000.
The deferred consideration was subsequently paid in full in February 2015.
Mainline Menswear is primarily an online niche retailer of premium branded mens apparel and footwear.
The measurement period concluded in the 52 week period ended 30 January 2016, with no measurement adjustments being made to the fair values in the period.
The final goodwill calculation is summarised below: Measurement Fair value at Book value adjustment 30 January 2016 000 000 000 Acquiree's net assets at acquisition date: Intangible assets - 843 843 Property, plant and equipment 52 - 52 Inventories 1,519 - 1,519 Cash 3,535 - 3,535 Trade and other receivables 60 - 60 Trade and other payables 692 - 692 Income tax liabilities 62 - 62 Deferred tax liabilities 10 169 179 Net identifiable assets 4,402 674 5,076 Non-controlling interest 20% 880 135 1,015 Goodwill on acquisition 7,363 Consideration paid - satisfied in cash 11,424 The intangible asset acquired represents the fair value of the Mainline fascia name.
The Board believes that the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of 7,363,000 is best considered as goodwill on acquisition representing employee expertise and anticipated future operating synergies.
Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12.
Acquisitions continued Ultimate Outdoors On 3 February 2014, the Group acquired, via its 100% owned subsidiary Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, 100% of the entire issued share capital of Ultimate Outdoors Limited for cash consideration of 835,000 which was equal to the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The measurement period concluded in the 52 week period ended 30 January 2016, with no measurement adjustments being made to the fair values in this period.
Oswald Bailey On 28 March 2014, the Group acquired, via its 100% owned subsidiary Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, the trade and assets of 14 stores and 2 websites trading as Oswald Bailey for cash consideration of 851,000 which was equal to the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Oswald Bailey is a retailer of outdoor footwear, apparel and equipment.
Disposals Prior Period Disposal Disposal of 100% of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of Bank Fashion Limited On 25 November 2014, the Group disposed of its 100% shareholding in Bank Fashion Limited to Huk 57 Limited a subsidiary of Hilco Capital Limited for a total consideration of 18.15m.
The total cash payment comprised 1 for the entire share capital of Bank Fashion Limited and 18.15m which repaid a substantial part of the intercompany receivable balance of 28.25m.
JD Sports Fashion Plc has recorded a provision of 10.1m against the remaining balance.
The assets and liabilities related to Bank Fashion Limited form a disposal group.
Further information related to the disposal is set out below: 52 weeks to 31 January 2015 000 Consideration received 18,150 Less carrying value of net assets disposed of 20,506 Less fascia name disposed of 5,481 Plus deferred tax on fascia name 1,519 Loss on disposal 6,318 Net cashflow on disposal: Consideration received 18,150 Less cash and cash equivalents disposed ofNet cash inflow from disposal 18,150 105 105 Financial Statements Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 14.
The goodwill in ActivInstinct of 6,617,000 arose in October 2013 on the acquisition of the share capital of ActivInstinct by the Groups newly formed subsidiary, ActivInstinct Holdings Limited.
ActivInstinct is a cash-generating unit and is included in the Sports Fashion segment.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the value-in-use, which has been calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 15.9% 2015: 13.7%.
The goodwill has been impaired following a weaker than anticipated performance due to increased competition in the marketplace and adverse currency movements.
The Board believes that the ActivInstinct fascia name 3,524,000 is recoverable after having performed relevant sensitivity analysis.
The Black and Millets fascia names of 8,500,000 arose in January 2012 on the acquisition of the trade and assets of Blacks Leisure Group Plc in administration by the Groups newly formed subsidiary, Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited.
Blacks is a cash-generating unit and is included in the Outdoor segment.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the value-in-use, which has been calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 15.3% 2015: 15.3%.
The fascia name has been partially impaired following a weaker than anticipated performance following generally milder weather resulting in heavy discounting across the wider Outdoor Sector which impacted margins.
The Board believes that the remainder of the Blacks fascia name 3,000,000 and Millets fascia name 2,000,000 are recoverable after having performed relevant sensitivity analysis.
The impairment in the previous period related to the impairment of the goodwill arising in prior years on the acquisition of Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited Blacks, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Kukri Sports Limited, the Kukri brand name and the Ark fascia name.

Intangible Assets continued Intangibles Assets with Definite Lives Brand Licences Brand licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation of brand licences is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement within cost of sales over the term to the licence expiry on a straight line basis.
Brand licences are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the relevant cash-generating unit until the licence expiry date and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
The Groups brand licences and the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations, are as follows: Basic information Impairment model assumptions used Short term Long term Pre Tax Pre Tax Net Book Net Book growth growth Discount rate Discount rate Cost Value 2016 Value 2015 rate 1 rate 2 3 2016 3 2015 Group Segment Terms 000 000 000 % % Margin rate % % Fila Sports Fashion 10 year licence from 7,500 3,687 4,437 2.0% 2.0% Gross margins over the remaining 12.9% 13.0% January 2011 for exclusive licence period are assumed to be use of the brand in the UK consistent with approved budget levels and Republic of Ireland for the period ending January 17 Sergio Sports Fashion Sub-licence to use the 4,279 - - N A N A The licence has been fully written down N A - fully N A - fully brand in the UK in the period ended January 2015 written down written down 11,779 3,687 4,437 1 The short term growth rate is the Board approved compound annual growth rate in sales for the first two year period following the January 2017 financial year currently underway 2 The long term growth rate is the rate used thereafter until the end of the licence period 3 The discount rate applied is pre-tax and reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets, for which future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.

Intangible Assets continued Brand Names Brand names acquired as part of a business combination are stated at fair value as at the acquisition date less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Brand names separately acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful economic life of each purchased brand name is considered to be finite.
Brand names are all amortised over a period of 10 years and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Brand names are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
The recoverable amount of brand names is determined based on a royalty relief method of valuation.
This is based on an estimation of future sales and the choice of a suitable royalty and discount rate in order to calculate the present value, when this method is deemed the most appropriate.
This method involves calculating a net present value for each brand by discounting the projected future royalties expected over the remaining useful life of each brand.
The future royalties are estimated by applying a suitable royalty rate to the sales forecast.
Alternatively the carrying value of the brand names has been allocated to a cash-generating unit, along with the relevant goodwill and fascia names, and tested in the value-in-use calculation performed for that cashgenerating unit see below.

Intangible Assets continued Software Development Software developments costs including website development costs are capitalised as Intangible Assets if the technical and commercial feasibility of the project has been demonstrated, the future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably.
Costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs are stated at historic cost, less accumulated amortisation.
Software development costs are all amortised over a period of two to seven years and the amortisation charge is included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Intangibles Assets with Indefinite Lives Fascia Name Separately identifiable fascia names acquired are stated at fair value as at the acquisition date less accumulated impairment losses.
With the exception of the Champion fascia name, all fascia names are not being amortised as management consider these assets to have indefinite useful economic life.
All fascia names are subject to an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if there is an indicator that the fascia name is impaired.
As the remaining Champion stores are being converted to the JD fascia it was determined that this now indicates that the Champion fascia name has a finite useful life and should be amortised in line with the conversion programme.
The change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite in the previous period was accounted for as a change in the accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8.
The fascia name has been fully amortised in the period ended 30 January 2016.
Factors considered by the Board in determining that the useful life of the fascia names are indefinite for all fascia names with the exception of Champion : The strength of the respective fascia names in the relevant sector and geographic region where the fascia is located The history of the fascia names and that of similar assets in the UK in relation to Blacks, Millets, Tessuti, Ark and Tiso, Spain Sprinter and Germany Isico retail sectors The commitment of the Group to continue to operate these stores separately for the foreseeable future, including the ongoing investment in new stores and refurbishments The strength of the respective online fascia names for the online fascias acquired Cloggs, ActivInstinct and Mainline Menswear 109 109 Financial Statements Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 14.
Intangible Assets continued Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
Method 1: For acquisitions on or after 31 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit loss on disposal.
Method 2: In respect of business acquisitions that occurred from 1 February 2004 to 30 January 2010, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative negative goodwill, it was recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement as an exceptional item.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
Method 3: In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 February 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening adopted IFRS balance sheet at 1 February 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cashgenerating units and is tested annually for impairment and whenever there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired.
The cash-generating units used are individual stores and the groups of cash-generating units are either the store portfolios or individual businesses acquired.
The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The carrying amount of goodwill and fascia name by cash-generating units, along with the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation is set out on the following pages: Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 14.

Intangible Assets continued The cash flow projections used in the value-in-use calculations are all based on actual operating results, together with financial forecasts and strategy plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These forecasts and plans are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development.
Sensitivity Analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions of margin growth used for assessing the goodwill and other intangibles.
With regards to the assessment of value-in-use of all cash-generating units, with the exceptions of those listed below, the Board believe that there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions, which would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Blacks and Millets cash-generating unit, changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Board has considered the possibility of each of these businesses achieving less revenue and gross profit % than forecast.
Whilst any reduction in revenue would be partially offset by a reduction in revenue related costs, the Board would also take actions to mitigate the loss of gross profit by reducing other costs.
Blacks and Millets Should the business not achieve the assumed store gross margin rate % growth in the first five year period of 2.0% by 1.0% and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of 5,000,000.
All other assumptions remain unchanged.
Should the business not achieve the assumed online gross margin rate % growth in the first five year period of 2.9% by 1.0% and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of 1,100,000.
Should the pre-tax discount rate increase by 1%, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of 2,800,000.
Brand names in the Company comprise all brand names included in the Group table above within the Sport Fashion segment, with the exception of the fair value adjustments remaining in relation to brand name acquired on acquisition of Duffer of St George 684,000.
Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 15.
Property, Plant and Equipment Owned Assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful economic lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
Legal fees and other costs associated with the acquisition of a leasehold interest are capitalised within non-current other assets see note 17.
These costs are amortised over the life of the lease.
Rental income from operating leases where the Group is the lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: Freehold land not depreciated Long leasehold and freehold properties 2% per annum on a straight line basis Improvements to short leasehold properties life of lease on a straight line basis Computer equipment 3 - 4 years on a straight line basis Fixtures and fittings 5 - 7 years, or length of lease if shorter, on a straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% per annum on a reducing balance basis 113 113 Financial Statements Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 15.
The cash-generating units represent individual stores with the loss based on the specific revenue streams and costs attributable to those cash-generating units.
Assets in impaired stores are written down to their recoverable amount which is calculated as the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Property, Plant and Equipment continued Leased Assets Assets funded through finance leases and similar hire purchase contracts are capitalised as property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Future instalments under such leases, net of financing costs, are included within interestbearing loans and borrowings.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is included in finance costs, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments so as to give a constant charge on the outstanding obligation.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental costs, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Contingent rentals payable based on store revenues are accrued in line with the related sales and are charged as expenses in the period to which they relate.
The value of any lease incentives is recognised as deferred income and credited to the Consolidated Income Statement against rentals payable on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
The carrying amount of the Groups property, plant and equipment includes an amount of 122,000 2015: 63,000 in respect of motor vehicles held under finance leases.
The depreciation charge on those motor vehicles for the current period was 36,000 2015: 26,000.
Investment Property Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Investment property is depreciated over a period of 50 years on a straight line basis, with the exception of freehold land, which is not depreciated.
The Group has elected not to revalue investment property annually but to disclose the fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The fair value is based on an external valuation prepared by persons having the appropriate professional qualification and experience.
Company 000 Cost 1 February 2014, 31 January 2015 and 30 January 2016 4,837 Depreciation and impairment At 1 February 2014 1,264 Charge for period 41 At 31 January 2015 1,305 Charge for period 41 At 30 January 2016 1,346 Net book value At 30 January 2016 3,491 At 31 January 2015 3,532 At 1 February 2014 3,573 The investment properties brought forward relate to properties leased to Focus Brands Limited 4,160,000 and Kukri Sports Limited 677,000.
Both of these properties are owner-occupied from the perspective of the Group as both Focus Brands Limited and Kukri Sports Limited are subsidiaries of the Group.
These properties however remain Investment Properties from the Company perspective as at 30 January 2016.
Based on an external valuation, the fair value of the investment properties as at 30 January 2016 was 3,977,000 2015: 3,777,000.
Management do not consider either of the investment properties to be impaired as the future rental income supports the carrying value.
Non-current Other Assets Key Money Monies paid in certain countries to give access to retail locations are capitalised within non-current assets.
Key money is stated at historic cost less impairment losses.
These assets are not depreciated as past experience has shown that the key money is fully recoverable on disposal of a retail location and is deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life but will be impaired if evidence exists that the market value is less than the historic cost.
Gains losses on key money from the subsequent disposal of these retail locations are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Deposits Money paid in certain countries as deposits to store landlords as protection against non-payment of rent, is capitalised within non-current assets.
A provision for the impairment of these deposits is established when there is objective evidence that the landlord will not repay the deposit in full.
Legal Fees Legal fees and other costs associated with the acquisition of a leasehold interest are capitalised within non-current other assets and amortised over the life of the lease.
Lease Premia Money paid in certain countries specifically to landlords or tenants as an incentive to exit an existing lease commonly referred to as compensation for early termination, to enable acquisition of that lease.
These payments are capitalised within other non-current assets and amortised over the life of the lease.
Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 17.
Investments In the Companys accounts all investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost less provisions for impairment losses.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the equity attributable to holders of the parent.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date that control commences and the attributable share of changes in equity subsequent to that date.
Joint Ventures Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control based on a contractual arrangement.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets.
Losses of the joint venture in excess of the Groups interest in it are not recognised.
Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Changes in Ownership Interest Without a Loss of Control In accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 2008, upon a change in ownership interest in a subsidiary without a loss of control, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Acquisitions or disposals of non-controlling interests are therefore accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
Associated transaction costs are accounted for within equity.
Company 000 Cost At 1 February 2014 60,697 Additions 14,452 At 31 January 2015 75,149 Additions 106 At 30 January 2016 75,255 Impairment At 1 February 2014, 31 January 2015 and 30 January 2016 5,470 Net book value At 30 January 2016 69,785 At 31 January 2015 69,679 At 1 February 2014 55,227 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 18.

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the weighted average principle.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark downs and shrinkage.

The Group has 28,430,000 2015: 24,602,000 of stock provisions at the end of the period.
The Company has 12,450,000 2015: 9,798,000 of stock provisions at the end of the period.
Cost of inventories includes a net charge of 7,800,000 2015: 12,800,000 in relation to net provisions recognised against inventories.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Trade and Other Receivables continued The ageing of the impaired gross receivables is detailed below: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Not past due 3 - - - Past due 0 - 30 days 31 47 - 25 Past due 30 - 60 days 175 115 173 108 Past 60 days 676 947 327 87 885 1,109 500 220 The Board consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate their fair value.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the majority of the Groups customer base being wide and unrelated.
Therefore, no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for impairment losses, which has been calculated following individual assessments of credit quality based on historic default rates and knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk.
Movement on this provision is shown below: Group Company 000 000 At 1 February 2014 650 100 Created 815 120 Released 24 - Utilised 11 - Divestments 381 - Exchange differences 12 - At 31 January 2015 1,109 220 Created 437 339 Released 7 - Utilised 642 59 Divestments - - Exchange differences 12 - At 30 January 2016 885 500 The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as these are used as an integral part of the Groups cash management.

Interest-bearing Loans and Borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Following the initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

Bank Facilities On 1 September 2015, the Group amended and extended its syndicated committed 155,000,000 bank facility which previously expired on 11 October 2017.
The facility has been amended by increasing the syndicated committed facility by 60,000,000 to 215,000,000.
The expiry date has also been extended by two years and so the amended facility now expires on 11 October 2019.
Under this facility, a maximum of 10 drawdowns can be outstanding at any time with drawdowns made for a period of one, two, three or six months with interest currently payable at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.10% 2015: 1.35%.
The arrangement fee payable on the amended facility is 0.5% on 60,000,000 of the commitment and 0.25% on 155,000,000 of the commitment.
The commitment fee on the undrawn element of the facility is 35% of the applicable margin rate.
This facility encompasses cross guarantees between the Company, RD Scott Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, Tessuti Limited and Focus International Limited.
At 30 January 2016, nil was drawn down on this facility 2015: 31,000,000.

Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22.
Interest-bearing Loans and Borrowings continued The maturity of the bank loans and overdrafts is as follows: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Within one year 6,191 5,620 - - Between one and five years - 60 - - 6,191 5,680 - - Other Loans The acquisition of Tessuti Group Limited included a freehold property with a mortgage balance remaining of 508,000 at the time of acquisition.

Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial Assets The Groups financial assets are all categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of derivative assets.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term cash deposits with major United Kingdom and European clearing banks earning floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates or rates linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
Other financial liabilities, with the exception of foreign exchange forward contracts and put option liabilities, are measured at amortised cost.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and Trade and other payables.
The currency profile of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is shown below: Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 6,575 37,087 - 31,000 Sterling 6,500 36,872 - 31,000 Euros 53 176 - - US Dollars - 39 - - Australian Dollars 4 - - - New Zealand Dollars 18 - - - 6,575 37,087 - 31,000 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 23.
Financial Instruments continued Risk Management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments, which are reviewed on a regular basis.
Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
There are no concentrations of risk in the period to 30 January 2016.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits, reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
Interest rate risk therefore arises from bank borrowings.
Interest rate hedging has not been put in place on the current facility.
The Directors continue to be mindful of the potential volatility in base rates, but at present do not consider a long term interest rate hedge to be necessary given the inherent short term nature of both the revolving credit facility and working capital facility.
This position is reviewed regularly, along with the level of facility required.
The Group has potential bank floating rate financial liabilities on the 215,000,000 committed bank facility, together with overdraft facilities in subsidiary companies see note 22.
At 30 January 2016 nil was drawn down from the committed bank facility 2015: 31,000,000.
When drawdowns are made, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk with interest paid at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.10% 2015: 1.35%.
As at 30 January 2016 the Group has liabilities of 108,000 2015: 63,000, in respect of finance lease or similar hire purchase contracts.
A change of 1.0% in the average interest rates during the year, applied to the Groups floating interest rate loans and borrowings as at the reporting date, would change profit before tax by 610,000 2015: 938,000 and would change equity by 610,000 2015: 938,000.
The calculation is based on any floating interest rate loans and borrowings drawn down at the period end date.
This includes the Groups committed bank facility, Tiso Group Limiteds overdraft and Cloggs Online Limiteds overdraft.
Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and assume that all other variables remain unchanged.
Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences in monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the accounting period.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are presented in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and remeasured at each period end.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position with movements in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the respective risk profiles of the swap counterparties.
125 125 Financial Statements Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 23.
Financial Instruments continued Hedging of Monetary Assets and Liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro and US Dollar with sales made in Euros and purchases made in both Euros and US Dollars principal exposure.
To protect its foreign currency position, the Group sets a buying rate in each country for the purchase of goods in US Dollars at the start of the buying season typically six to nine months before the product actually starts to appear in the stores and then enters into a number of local currency US Dollar contracts whereby the minimum exchange rate on the purchase of dollars is guaranteed.
As at 30 January 2016, options have been entered into to protect approximately 85% of the US Dollar requirement for the period to January 2017.
The balance of the US Dollar requirement for the period will be satisfied at spot rates.
As at 30 January 2016, the fair value of these instruments was a liability of 4,344,000 2015: asset of 2,888,000 and these are all classified as due within one year.
A loss of 4,344,000 2015: gain of 2,888,000 has been recognised in cost of sales within the Consolidated Income Statement for the change in fair value of these instruments.
We have considered the credit risk of the Groups and counterpartys credit risk and this is not expected to have a material effect on the valuation of these options.
A 10.0% strengthening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have reduced profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2016 2015 2016 2015 Impact of 10% strengthening of sterling 000 000 000 000 Euros 4,147 5,487 10,937 7,571 US Dollars 615 363 615 362 Australian Dollars 28 80 55 95 New Zealand Dollars 50 59 74 67 Other 32 3 129 15 4,872 5,992 11,552 8,080 A 10.0% weakening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have increased profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2016 2015 2016 2015 Impact of 10% weakening of sterling 000 000 000 000 Euros 5,068 6,707 13,534 9,496 US Dollars 752 444 752 440 Australian Dollars 35 98 67 107 New Zealand Dollars 61 73 91 74 Other 33 3 164 218 5,949 7,325 14,280 9,899 Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and the method assumes that all other variables remain unchanged.
Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 23.
Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the possibility of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through major United Kingdom and European clearing banks, which must meet minimum credit ratings as required by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for impairment where amounts are not thought to be recoverable see note 20.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and receivables which are not impaired are believed to be recoverable.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be equivalent to total trade and other receivables of 56,375,000 2015: 53,922,000 and cash and cash equivalents of 215,996,000 2015: 121,317,000.
The Company has provided guarantees on working capital and other banking facilities entered into by Spodis SA 6,600,000, Sprinter Megacentros Del Deporte SLU 8,750,000, Cloggs Online Limited 500,000, Kukri Sports Limited and Kukri GB Limited 1,000,000, and Kooga Rugby Limited 250,000.
As at 30 January 2016, these facilities were drawn down by 490,000 2015: nil.
In addition, the syndicated committed 215,000,000 bank facility, which was in place as at 30 January 2016, encompassed cross guarantees between the Company, RD Scott Limited, Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Blacks Outdoor Retail Limited, Tessuti Limited and Focus International Limited to the extent to which any of these companies were overdrawn.
As at 30 January 2016, these facilities were drawn down by nil 2015: 31,000,000.
Liquidity Risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirement to minimise net interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The forecast cash and borrowing profile of the Group is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The Board review 13 week and annual cash flow forecasts each month.
Information about the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities is disclosed in note 22.
As at 30 January 2016, there are committed facilities with a maturity profile as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years - 155,000 Expiring in more than three years but no more than four years 215,000 - 215,000 155,000 The commitment fee on these facilities is 0.35% 2015: 0.45%.

On this basis, the fair value hierarchy reflects the carrying values.
In respect of the Groups non-current financial assets and liabilities as at 30 January 2016 and 31 January 2015, the fair value has been calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.3% 2015: 12.4% which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the specific risks applicable to the liability.
