Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 1.
Accounting policies Elementis Plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101.
These are presented on pages 109 to 114.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and financial instruments held for trading or available for sale are stated at their fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements requires the application of estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and costs and related disclosures at the balance sheet date.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied across Group companies to all periods presented in these Consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The rationale for adopting this basis is discussed in the Directors report on page 60.
Reporting currency As a consequence of the majority of the Groups sales and earnings originating in US dollars or US dollar linked currencies, the Group has chosen the US dollar as its reporting currency.
This aligns the Groups external reporting with the pro le of the Group, as well as with internal management reporting.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty When applying the Groups accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements on the application of applicable accounting standards and estimates and assumptions concerning the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience, which may differ signi cantly from the actual outcome.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below.
The development of the estimates and disclosures related to each of these matters has been discussed by the AuditCommittee.
Critical accounting judgements The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, that the directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition In making its judgement, the Directors have considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods set out in IAS 18 Revenue and, in particular, whether the Group had transferred the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods.
Following further assessment of the terms of shipment, the Directors have concluded that international shipments should not be recognised within revenue until they reach the destination port, as they believe that this more accurately re ects the commercial substance of the transaction.
Due to this change in the accounting policy, the prior year comparatives have been restated to provide comparable information.
More information on this restatement of the comparative balances is given in note 31. b.
Recognition of a fide ned bene t pension asset In accordance with IAS 19, for any pension plan in surplus, the amount recognised as an asset is limited to an asset ceiling, being the present value of any potential refund or a reduction in future contributions.
Following the guidance in IFRIC 14, the Group has assessed the nature of the minimum funding requirement of the UK scheme alongside the unconditional right to a refund of any surplus under any winding up of the plan and concluded it is appropriate to recognise the full value of any pension surplus.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a signi cant risk of causing a material misstatement to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci c to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
In accordance with the Groups environmental policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised when the land is 74 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information contaminated.
Provisions for environmental issues are judgemental by their nature, particularly when considering the size and timing of remediation spending, and more dif cult to estimate when they relate to sites no longer directly controlled by the Group.
Pension and other post retirement bene ts In respect of the Groups fide ned bene t schemes, the Groups net obligation in respect of fide ned bene t pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future bene t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, that bene t is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
Pension and post retirement liabilities are calculated by quali ed actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Following the introduction of the revised IAS19 Employee Bene ts standard, the net interest on the fide ned bene t liability consists of the interest cost on the fide ned bene t obligation and the interest income on plan assets, both calculated by reference to the discount rate used to measure the fide ned bene t obligation at the start of the period.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group also operates a small number of fide ned contribution schemes and the contributions payable during the year are recognised as incurred.
Due to the size of the Groups pension scheme assets and liabilities, relatively small changes in the assumptions can have a signi cant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability recorded in the balance sheet.
c. Taxation Income tax on the pro t or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable pro t other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In 2014, an asset of $42.0 million was recognised relating to UK advance corporation credits which had previously been unrecognised because of uncertainty over the availability of UK taxable pro ts and hence a tax liability against which to utilise the credits.
During 2014 the Group transferred some pro table product manufacturing to the UK from overseas, restructured the nancing of an overseas subsidiary and gained greater certainty on future UK pension contributions, all of which led to a reasonable expectation that UK taxable pro ts would arise in the future and therefore that the tax credits should be recognised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax bene t will be realised.
The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
The Group operates in a number of countries in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.
As a consequence the Group is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Managements judgement is required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of country speci c tax law and likelihood of settlement.
However, the actual tax liabilities could differ from the position and in such events an adjustment would be required in the subsequent period which could have a material impact.
Tax bene ts are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax bene t to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the bene t on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation.
This evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast of future taxable income.
d. Impairment of goodwill and other inde nite lived intangible assets Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill and other inde nite lived intangible assets which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash-generating units CGUs.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash ows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs.
Further details of these estimates are given in note 10.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements introduces new principles for control which focuses on whether the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with entities and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over those entities.
The Groups consolidation scope and the accounting treatment of its investments in other entities was unaffected by the adoption of IFRS 10.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during a period are included in the Consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2016 75 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued The Group adopted IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations for business combinations where the acquisition date was on or after 1January 2010.
This measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred, the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree, less the fair value of the identi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Acquisition costs are accounted forasan expense in the period incurred.
For acquisitions that were made by the Group between its initial adoption of IFRS in 2005 and 31December 2009 goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, the Company has not restated business combinations that took place prior to the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004.
As a consequence the Scheme of Arrangement entered into in 1998 whereby the Company acquired Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override to account for the transaction as a merger has not been restated under IFRS.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets andliabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated atexchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange ruling for the relevant period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 on translation are taken to the translation reserve.
They are recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
The Group may hedge a portion of the translation of its overseas net assets through pounds sterling and Euro borrowings.
From 1 January 2005, the Group has elected to apply net investment hedge accounting for these transactions where possible.
Where hedging is applied, the effective portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment is recognised in equity.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has signi cant in uence, but not control over the financial and operating policies.
The Consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the post-acquisition total recognised gains and losses and the net assets of associates on an equity accounted basis.
Where the Groups share of losses exceeds its investment in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Leasehold property is depreciated over the period of the lease.
Freehold buildings, plant and machinery, xtures, ttings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are assessed at the reporting date.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until the asset is brought into use.
Estimates of useful lives of these assets are: Buildings 10 50 years Plant and machinery 2 20 years Fixtures, ttings and equipment 2 20 years The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic bene ts embodied within it will ow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Management regularly considers whether there are any indications of impairment to carrying values of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment reviews are based on risk adjusted discounted cash ow projections.
Signi cant judgement is applied to the assumptions underlying these projections which include estimated discount rates, growth rates, future selling prices and direct costs.
Changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on the financial position of the Group and on the result for the year.

Goodwill All business combinations since the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since the transition date, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of net identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and tested annually for impairment.
Changes to the assumptions used in impairment testing could have a material impact on the financial position of the Group and of the result for the year.
Research and development Expenditure on pure research is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Under IAS 38, expenditure on development where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes is capitalised if the product or process will give rise to future economic bene ts and where the cost of the capitalised asset can be measured reliably.
Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated amortisation.
The length of development lifecycles, broad nature of much of the research undertaken and uncertainty until a late stage as to ultimate commercial viability of a potential product can mean that the measurement criteria of IAS 38 regarding the probability of future economic bene ts and the reliability of allocating costs may not be met, in which case expenditure is expensed as incurred.
c. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost or when arising in a business combination, estimated fair value, less accumulated amortisation.
d. Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are inde nite.
On this basis there is no amortisation of intangible assets relating to brand.
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets, comprising customer lists, trademarks, patents and non-compete clauses, are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 5-10 years.
Impairment The carrying amount of non-current assets other than deferred tax is compared to the assets recoverable amount at each balance sheetdate where there is an indication of impairment.
For goodwill, assets that have an inde nite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever thecarrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cashgenerating unit is the smallest identi able group of assets that generates cash in ows that are largely independent of the cash in ows fromother assets or groups of assets.
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value ofmoney and the risks speci c to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash in ows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Leased assets Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as finance leases.
An asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.
Future instalments net of finance charges are included within borrowings.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge, which is allocated to each period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability and charged to the income statement and reduction of the outstanding liability.
Rental costs arising from operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Investments Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Government grants Grants against capital expenditure from government and other bodies are shown separately in the balance sheet.
Such grants are released to the pro t and loss account over the same period for which the relevant assets are depreciated.
Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2016 77 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price, less estimated costsof completion and selling expenses.
Cost, which is based on a weighted average, includes expenditure incurred in acquiring stock and bringing it to its existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads attributable to manufacture, based on normal operating capacity.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal amount which is the original invoiced amount less provision made for bad and doubtful receivables.
Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of receivables and historical experience.
Individual trade receivables are written off when management deem them no longer to be collectable.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset a disposal group, is classi ed as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable within one year.
On initial classi cation as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower ofprevious carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to pro t or loss.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classi ed as held for sale.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost which is equal to the fair value at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the terms of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Trade payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing borrowings and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.
Whenshare capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, isrecognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares by the Company are classi ed as treasury shares and are presented asadeduction from total equity.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Due to the requirement to measure the effectiveness of hedging instruments, changes in market conditions can result in the recognition of unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash ow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash ows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly inthe hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in a fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised rm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves.
78 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Termination bene ts Termination bene ts are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement date.
Termination bene ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement only where there is evidence that the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and where the collectability of revenue is reasonably assured.
This may occur, depending on the individual customer relationship, when the product has been transferred to a freight carrier, when the customer has received the product or, for consignment stock held at customers premises, when usage reports for the relevant period have been compiled.
Where goods are shipped but the Group continues to bear insurance risk until they reach their destination, revenue is only recognised when the goods reach their destination.
Other expenses Other expenses are administration costs incurred and paid by the Groups pension schemes, which relate primarily to former employees of legacy businesses.
Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, dividends on preference shares classi ed as liabilities, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken to the income statement.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share options, cash settled shadow options and LTIP awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options awards.
The fair value of the options awards granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an employee expense is adjusted to re ect the actual number of share options awards that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Own shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT Transactions of the Group sponsored ESOT are included in the Consolidated financial statements.
In particular, the ESOTs purchases ofshares in the Company are charged directly to equity.
Non-statutory performance measures In the analysis of the Groups operating results, earnings per share and cash ows, information is presented to provide readers with additional performance indicators that are prepared on a non-statutory basis.
This presentation is regularly reviewed by management toidentify items that are unusual and other items relevant to an understanding of the Groups performance and long term trends with reference to their materiality and nature.
This additional information is not uniformly fide ned by all companies and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other organisations.
The non-statutory disclosures should not be viewed in isolation or asan alternative to the equivalent statutory measure.
Information for separate presentation is considered as follows: Material costs or reversals arising from a signi cant restructuring of the Groups operations are presented separately.
Disposal of entities or investments in associates or joint ventures or impairment of related assets are presented separately.
Other matters arising due to the Groups acquisition, such as adjustments to contingent consideration, payment of retention bonuses, acquisition costs and fair value adjustments for acquired assets made in accordance with IFRS 13 are separately disclosed in aggregate.
If a change in an accounting estimate for provisions, including environmental provisions, results in a material gain or loss, that is presented separately.
Other items the directors may deem to be unusual as a result of their size and or nature.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued that are mandatorily effective for accounting periods that begin on or after 1 January 2016.
Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements: Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2016 79 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 continued 1.

New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and, in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 2 amendments Classi cation and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions IAS 7 amendments Disclosure Initiative IAS 12 amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments Sale of Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IFRS 4 amendments Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration IAS 40 amendments Transfers of Investment Property Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-16 Cycle.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except as noted below: IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments: IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements: and IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the reported assets, liabilities, income statement and cash ows of the Group.
Furthermore, extensive disclosures will be required by IFRS 16.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Operating segments Business segments The Group has determined its operating segments on the basis of those used for management, internal reporting purposes and the allocation of strategic resources.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, the Groups chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors.
The three reportable segments, Specialty Products, Surfactants and Chromium, each have distinct product groupings and, with the exception of Surfactants which shares a common management structure with Specialty Products, separate management structures.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment and those that may be reasonably allocated from corporate activities.
Presentation of the segmental results is on a basis consistent with those used for reporting Group results.
Principal activities of the reportable segments are as follows: Specialty Products: Production of rheological and other specialty additives, compounded products and colourants.
Surfactants: Production of surface active ingredients.
Chromium: Production of chromium chemicals.
Inter-segment pricing is set at a level that equates to the manufacturing cost of the product plus a commercially appropriate mark up.

Restructuring Following the appointment of a new Chief Executive Of cer, the Group has reorganised the management structure and various parts of the business.
Costs of this exercise including redundancy costs, as well as recruitment and other costs associated with changes in the management structure, was $3.0 million.
Business review In the first half of 2016 a business review was undertaken with external assistance to support development of the long term strategy for Elementis.
The one time cost of this exercise was $2.4 million.
Environmental provisions The Groups environmental provisions is calculated on a discounted basis, re ecting the time period over which spending is estimated totake place.
Following discussions with our external environmental advisers the Group has concluded that it would be appropriate to reduce the discount rate being used to value liabilities resulting in a charge of $4.5 million.
We continue to fund the remediation work on the legacy Chromium site at Eaglescliffe that was closed in 2009.
The work programme is determined in part through consultation with the local regulatory authorities and a re-assessment in the year of the outstanding tasks and their timeframe has resulted in a charge of $3.5 million.
Acquisition costs On 10 February 2017 the Group announced its intention to acquire SummitReheis.
During 2016 transaction related costs of $0.8 million were incurred in connection with this acquisition.
Further costs will be expensed in 2017.

The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $318.5 million and Elementis Surfactants $2.7 million.
There is no goodwill associated with Elementis Chromium.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that re ect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the CGUs.
In order to stress test the results over a wider range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital structures that re ect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs.
In this exercise a range of discount rates from 11.3 per cent to 12.3 per cent 2015: 8.0 per cent to 14.0 per cent was used.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash ows for the following 17 years based on estimated growth rates of 2.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The results of the impairment testing using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangibles represent the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the Deuchem, Fancor, Watercryl and Hi-Mar acquisitions.
The Group considers these to have signi cant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate to assign these assets an inde nite useful life.
Brand intangibles are tested annually for impairment using similar assumptions to the goodwill testing.
The remaining intangible assets comprise the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and noncompete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of five to ten years.

Where this is not the case, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
There are no signi cant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in subsidiaries and associates.
Deferred tax liabilities are reduced for any deferred tax assets which exist within a jurisdiction where consolidated tax returns are led and where tax assets and liabilities may be netted.
An asset of $42.0 million was recognised in 2014 relating to UK advance corporation tax credits which had previously been unrecognised because of uncertainty over future UK taxable pro ts.
During 2014 the Group made certain changes to its manufacturing and nancing structures, which together with greater certainty over the funding of the UK pension fide cit, led to the view that UK taxable pro ts would increase and therefore that the tax credits should be recognised.

Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
TheGroups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limitsand controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to re ectchanges in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an in uence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a signi cant proportion of the Groups revenue.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a speci c loss component that relates to individually signi cant exposures, andacollective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identi ed.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through a treasury policy that imposes graduated limits on the amount of funds that can be deposited with counterparties by reference to the counterparties credit ratings, as fide ned by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have suf cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had $113.4 million 2015: $115.1 million of undrawn committed facilities, of which $100.0 million expires after more than one year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, that will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the US dollar and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 100 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
94 Elementis plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash ows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US dollar, but also euro and pounds sterling.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of a subsidiarys net assets.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both xed and oating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest pro le.
The policy does not require that a speci c proportion of the Groups borrowings are at xed rates of interest.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Groups fide ned bene t pension obligations.
In respect of the US schemes, management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise investment returns, without excessive risk taking, in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded bene t obligations: management is assisted by external advisors in this regard.
In respect of the UK scheme, the investment strategy is set by the trustees and the Board is kept informed.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market con dence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on operating capital employed ROCE both including and excluding goodwill, as fide ned on page 16.
The Groups target is to achieve a ROCE including goodwill in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees, including executive directors, hold 0.2 per cent 2015: 0.4 per cent of ordinary shares, or 1.8 per cent 2015: 1.8 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.
Current dividend policy is to pay a progressive dividend of approximately one third of earnings per share after adjusting items.
Additionally if the Group nishes the year in a net balance sheet cash position, and there are no immediate investment plans for that cash, the Group may recommend an additional special dividend of up to 50 per cent of the net cash amount.
These dividend policies remain under review to ensure that they remain appropriate to the circumstances and strategy of the Group.

Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using signi cant unobservable inputs.
The following summarises the signi cant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
Derivatives level 2 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, thenfair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest based on government bonds.
Non-derivatives financial liabilities level 2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables level 3 The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash ows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting dateplus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2016 2015 % % Borrowings 0.9-2.7 0.9-2.7 At both 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 there was no difference between the carrying value and fair value of financial instruments.

Operating leases 2016 2015 $million $million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 4.1 4.1 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2016 2015 $million $million Within one year 3.9 4.3 In the second to fifth years inclusive 10.0 9.4 After five years 12.6 12.5 26.5 26.2 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
Retirement bene t obligations The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement bene t plans providing retirement bene ts for the majority of employees and executive directors.
At 31 December 2016 the main schemes in the UK and US were of the fide ned bene t type, thebene t being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds orare unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In the Netherlands the arrangement with the previous insurers of the fide ned bene t pension scheme came to an end on 31 December 2014 and the Group contracted with a new industry wide pension fundfor 2015 onwards.
Asaresult, the plan is now accounted for as a fide ned contribution plan.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post retirement medical bene t PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these bene ts is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
Other employee bene t schemes included in the table below relate to two unfunded pension schemes, a long term service award scheme in Germany and a special bene ts programme for a small number of former employees of the Eaglescliffe plant.

The bond assets category in the table above includes gross assets of $477.3 million 2015: $447.0 million and associated repurchase agreement liabilities of $117.8 million 2015: $97.8 million.
Repurchase agreements are entered into with counterparties to better offset the schemes exposure to interest and in ation rates, whilst remaining invested in assets of a similar risk pro le.
Interest rate and in ation rate derivatives are also employed to complement the use of xed and indexed linked bonds in matching the pro le of the schemes liabilities.
All equities, bonds and liquidity funds have quoted prices in active markets.
Other assets include insured annuities, an insurance fund and various swap products.
Within the UK pension scheme, the current asset allocation is approximately 40 per cent in a liability matching fund consisting of gilts xedinterest and index linked, bonds, cash and swaps and 60 per cent in an investment fund that includes various equity and equity likefunds.
The aim of the trustees is to manage the risk relative to the liabilities associated with the schemes investments through a combination of diversi cation, in ation protection and hedging of risk currency, interest rate and in ation risk.
The US scheme currently has over 60 per cent of its asset value invested in a range of equity funds designed to target higher returns and thus reduce the pension fide cit, with the balance invested in xed income bonds and cash.
The strategy is that as the fide cit reduces, a greater proportion of investments will be made into liability matching funds.

Actuarial valuations of retirement bene t plans in other jurisdictions have either not been updated for IAS 19 purposesor disclosed separately because of the costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employeesinvolved.
At 31 December 2016, the weighted average duration of the fide ned bene t obligations for the major schemes was as follows: UK: 15 years US: 10 years Sensitivity analysis The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increased decreased by 0.5% Decreased increased by 7% Rate of inflation Increased decreased by 0.5% Increased decreased by 4% Rate of salary growth Increased decreased by 0.5% Increased decreased by 0% Rate of mortality Increased by 1 year Increased by 4% These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement of the fide ned obligation following a change in a particular assumption in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions.

Share based payments The Company has several share incentive schemes for certain directors and employees of the Group.
A Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2008 amended in 2010 and 2015 LTIP for selected senior executives including the executive directors, business presidents and general counsel.
Awards of nil cost share options or conditional share awards are normally made annually and the maximum value of any grant to an individual is two times the CEOs basic salary.
Awards vest after three years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions over a three year period.
Vested awards are then exercisable for up to seven years, subject to the rules of the plan.
For US participants prior to 2015 for tax reasons, the default practice is for options to be exercised at the date of vesting.
From 2015, US participants received awards structured as restricted stock units.
Buyout awards for our CEO and CFO were made in 2016.
These awards were made under our remuneration recruitment policy and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Further detail on these buy out awards can be found in the Annual report on remuneration, on pages 52and 53.
Two tranches of awards of restricted stock units, over 225,645 ordinary shares per tranche, were made to the CEO on 7 March 2016.
The first tranche will vest on the 7 March 2017, and the second tranche on 7 March 2018.
Within each tranche was a portion 57.5percent that was subject only to a service requirement of one or two years from the date of award re ecting a minimum vesting value of the forfeited awards.
The balance of the award 42.5 per cent in each tranche was subject to performance conditions based on the following metrics: financial cash targets 30 per cent weight, operational HSE targets 30 per cent weight and speci c business objectives related to cost and talent management 40 per cent weight.
These metrics were in nature similar and equivalently challenging to those of the forfeited awards.
One buyout award was made to the CFO on 19 September 2016.
This is a nil cost option over 240,693 ordinary shares in Elementis.
Thisaward is subject to the same EPS and TSR performance conditions as those made in April 2016 to other participants of the Elementis LTIP and will ordinarily vest in April 2019.
For other executives, shareholders approved at the 2012 AGM an approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2012 ESOS.
This scheme replaced the previous approved and unapproved executive share option scheme 2003 ESOS which expired in 2013.
The last awards made under the 2003 scheme were in 2012.
Under the 2003 and 2012 ESOS, options are usually granted annually to purchase shares in the Company at an exercise price per share based on the Companys average mid-market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant with no discount applied.
The number of options that are granted are based on a percentage of the participants basic salary.
Options vest after three years and are subject to EPS and TSR performance conditions.
Vested options are then exercisable for up to seven years, subject to the rules of the schemes.
The Company operates two shadow executive share option schemes for a number of executives, who are employed or based in China, that are structured in almost all respects as the 2003 and 2012 ESOS.
The Company also operates a 2008 UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is a save as you earn SAYE scheme, under which UK employees can enter into contracts to save currently up to a maximum of 500 per month with a bank or building society foraperiod of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise oftheir options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price over the five working days preceding the invitation date, discounted by 20 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within six months following the end of the savings period.
A similar scheme exists for US employees.
Under the 2008 US Sharesave Scheme, US employees can enter into contracts to save up to a maximum of $2,000 per month with a bank or similarly approved institution, for a period of two years, and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid-market closing share price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within three months following the end of the savings period.
Options granted under the two savings based schemes are held subject to the rules of the schemes.
Options were valued as shown in the table below using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2016 2015 Fair value per option pence 142.6 136.8 Expected volatility per cent 28.0 27.0 Risk free rate per cent 0.5 0.9 Expected dividend yield per cent 1.9 1.1 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $2.3 million 2015: $2.1 million related toshare based payment transactions during the year.

These shadow options are included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.
Awards made as one-off agreements that borrow from the terms of the LTIP.
The weighted average exercise prices of options disclosed in the previous table were as follows: 2016 2015 Average Average exercise exercise price p price p At 1 January 121.4 104.9 Granted 91.8 132.1 Exercised 108.8 77.8 Expired 113.4 71.4 At 31 December 110.9 121.4 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of share options exercised during the year was 220 pence 2015: 252 pence.

Related party transactions The Company is a guarantor to the UK pension scheme under which it guarantees all current and future obligations of UK subsidiaries currently participating in the pension scheme to make payments to the scheme, up to a speci ed maximum amount.
The maximum amount of the guarantee is that which is needed at the time the guarantee is called on to bring the schemes funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund PPF guarantee, as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.

Dividends An interim dividend of 2.70 cents per share 2015: 2.70 cents was paid on 30 September 2016 and the Group is proposing a final dividendof5.75 cents per share 2015: 5.75 cents for the year ended 31 December 2016 and a special dividend of 8.35 cents per share 2015: 8.00 cents.
The total dividend for the year, excluding the special dividend, is 8.45 cents per share 2015: 8.45 cents and 16.80 cents per share 2015: 16.45 cents including the special dividend.
The amount payable for the final dividend and special dividend, based on the anticipated number of qualifying ordinary shares registered onthe record date, is $65.4 million.
The payment of this dividend will not have any tax consequences for the Group.

Directors remuneration is set out in the Directors remuneration report on pages 39 to 59.
Contingent liabilities As is the case with other chemical companies, the Group occasionally receives notices of litigation relating to regulatory and legal matters.
A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material out ow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
No contingent liability was considered to be reportable at 31 December 2016.
Events after the balance sheet date On 10 February 2017 the Group announced its intention to acquire SummitReheis, a global leader in the fast growing anti-perspirant actives market with operations in the US, Europe and Asia, for consideration of $360 million.
Completion of the acquisition is expected totake place in the second quarter of 2017 following receipt of anti-trust clearances in the US and Germany.
As at 31 December 2015, SummitReheis had total assets of $208 million and net assets of $12 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, SummitReheis is expected to report revenue of $134 million and underlying EBITDA of approximately $28 million.
The Group intends to fund the acquisition through its existing cash resources and new debt facilities of $475 million, which will also be used to re finance the existing $100 million revolving credit facility.
The new debt, which has a five year term, will be provided through a fully underwritten $275 million revolving credit facility and $200 million term loan facility and may be drawn, amongst other conditions, once the acquisition closing conditions have been met.

Prior year restatement During 2016 the Directors considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods set out in IAS 18 Revenue and, in particular, when the Group had transferred the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods.
Following further assessment of the terms of shipment, the Directors have concluded that international shipments should not be recognised within revenue until they reach the destination port, as they believe that this more accurately re ects the commercial substance of the transaction in that risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer at this point.
Due to this change in the accounting policy, the prior year comparatives have therefore been restated to provide comparable information.
