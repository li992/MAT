The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise securities in unlisted and listed companies, partnership interests, trade receivables, trade payables and cash.
The main risks arising from the Groups and Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
The financial risks of the Company are aligned to the Groups financial risks.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 83 Further Information Governance Financial Statements The Managers Report Strategic and Business Review Overview 18 Financial Instruments continued Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
Epiris has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Group is exposed to the risk of the change in value of its fund investments, listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
For listed investments the market risk variable is deemed to be the price itself.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these prices, is set out in part ii of this Note.
For unlisted equity and non-equity shares the market risk is deemed to be the price earnings ratio or other appropriate valuation methodology as set out in the accounting policy.
The impact on profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity, in absolute and percentage terms of those figures, due to movements in these variables, is set out in part vii of this Note.
Foreign Currency Risk The Companys total return and net assets are affected by foreign exchange translation movements as a significant proportion of the investments held are denominated in or impacted by currencies other than sterling.
The foreign investments held are principally held in the USA and Continental Europe.
The cancellation of the multi-currency facility Note 7 means the Company no longer hedges foreign currency risk.
The impact on profit after tax and on shareholders equity of 10% increases and decreases in the value of the US Dollar and Euro, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are analysed in part iii of this Note.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including realised capital profits.
These profits are held as cash balances.
The Company had no gearing at 30 September 2016.
Interest rate risk profiles for financial assets and liabilities and the impact of the profit or loss after tax and on shareholders equity of a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates, in absolute terms and as a percentage of those figures, are shown in part iv of this Note.
These profiles exclude short term receivables and payables.
Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
Whilst the unlisted equity is intentionally illiquid, short-term flexibility is achieved through cash which is available on demand.
Credit Risk The Groups exposure to credit risk principally arises from its cash deposits.
Only major banks with market capitalisation above 20 billion are used when making cash deposits and the level of cash is reviewed on a regular basis.
Cash was principally held with two UK banks see table below and totalled 659,214,000 2015: 147,123,000.

In doing so the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders whilst remaining within the restrictions imposed by its investment trust status, or issue new shares or debt.
During the year the Group paid dividends totalling 49,130,000 2015: 13,621,000.
The Group manages the levels of cash deposits held whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity for investments.
The Group has an existing authority to implement an on-market share buy-back programme to generate shareholder value.

Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 87 Further Information Governance Financial Statements The Managers Report Strategic and Business Review Overview 18 Financial Instruments continued vii Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
The Group complies with IFRS 13 in respect of disclosures about the degree of reliability of fair value measurements.
This requires the Group to classify, for disclosure purposes, fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
The following table represents the Groups assets by hierarchy levels: All fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As at 30 September 2016 m m m m Unlisted and listed investments 1,696 1,696 54 54 1,642 1,642 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As at 30 September 2015 m m m m Unlisted and listed investments 1,630 101 1,529 Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are therefore classified within Level 1, include active listed equities.
The Group does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments.
Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2.
Investments classified within Level 3 make use of significant unobservable inputs in deriving fair value, as they trade infrequently.
As observable prices are not available for these securities, the Group has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value.
Investments classified within Level 3 consist of private equity direct investments and fund and secondary positions.
88 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 18 Financial Instruments continued The main inputs into the Groups valuation models for private equity investments are EBITDA multiples based on the budgeted EBITDA or most recent EBITDA achieved or a rolling 12 months basis of the issuer and equivalent corresponding EBITDA multiples of comparable listed companies, quality of earnings assessments, assessments of third party external debt, comparability difference adjustments, cost of capital adjustments and probabilities of default.
The Group also considers the original transaction prices, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments and completed third-party transactions in comparable companies instruments and adjusts the model as deemed necessary.
In determining the valuation recommended to the Directors for the Groups equity instruments, the Manager uses comparable trading multiples in arriving at the valuation for private equity.
In accordance with the Groups policy, the Manager determines appropriate comparable public companies based on industry, size, developmental stage, revenue generation and strategy.
The Manager then calculates a trading multiple for each comparable company identified.
The multiple is calculated by dividing the enterprise value of the comparable group by its EBITDA.
The trading multiple is then adjusted for considerations such as illiquidity and other differences, advantages and disadvantages between the Groups portfolio company and the comparable public companies based on company specific facts and circumstances.
The value of private equity funds is primarily based on the latest available financial capital account statement of the private equity fund.
The Company may make adjustments to the value as set out in Note 23.
As at 30 September 2016 10% 2015: 10% of financial assets at fair value comprise of investments in private equity funds that have been valued in accordance with the policies set out in Note 23.
The private equity funds are not publicly traded and prior to maturity an exit can only be made by the Company through a sale of its investment and commitment through a secondary market.
The carrying values of the private equity funds may be significantly different from the values ultimately realised on an exit via a secondary market sale.

Increases in the EBITDA multiple would each lead to an increase in estimated value.
However, an increase in the comparability difference adjustment would lead to a decrease in value.
No inter-relationships between unobservable inputs used in the Groups valuation of its Level 3 equity investments have been identified.

Details of these schemes are as follows: Long term incentive scheme LTI Under this scheme participants invested in every new investment made by Electra between 1995 and March 2006.
In return, the participants are entitled to a percentage of the total capital and revenue profits made on each such investment.
The participants do not receive any profit until Electra has received back its initial investment.
1995 LTI Participants are entitled to a percentage of the incremental value of unlisted investments held at 31 March 1995, subject to Electra having received total proceeds equal to the valuation of those investments as at 31 March 1995 plus a preferred return.
96 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 21 Related Party Transactions continued The Initial Pool This relates to a pool of investments valued at 160 million at 31 March 2006 the initial pool.
Under this arrangement participants are entitled to 10% the carried interest of the aggregate realised profits of the initial pool.
The realised profits are calculated as being the aggregate of income and sale proceeds received by Electra less the 160 million opening value, less any additional purchases and less priority profit share.
Carried interest is payable only once realised profits exceed a preferred return of 15% compounded annually on the opening value of the initial pool plus the cost of further investments less realisations.
A full catch-up is payable once the realised profits of the initial pool exceed the preferred return.
This catch-up means that all proceeds above the cumulative preferred return accrue to participants until they have been paid an amount equating to 10% of the total realised profits of the initial pool.
Thereafter proceeds are split 90%:10% between Electra and the participants.
2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015 Pools In October 2006 new arrangements were entered into in respect of investments made over each consecutive three year period.
At the reporting date such arrangements are in operation in relation to the three year periods from 2006 to 2009, 2009 to 2012, 2012 to 2015 and 2015 to 2018 investments being made in each such period being referred to as a pool.
Under these arrangements participants are entitled to a carried interest of 18% of the aggregate realised profits in relation to direct investments in each pool.
The realised profits are calculated as being the aggregate of income and sale proceeds received by Electra less the purchase costs of investments and less priority profit share.
Carried interest is payable only once realised profits exceed a preferred return of 8% compounded annually on the cost of investments less realisations.
A full catch-up is payable once the realised profits exceed the preferred return.
This catch-up means that all proceeds above the cumulative preferred return accrue to participants until they have been paid an amount equating to 18% of the total realised profits.
Thereafter proceeds are split 82%:18% between Electra and the participants.
Similar arrangements are in place for indirect investments, the difference from the above arrangements being that the carried interest is 9% over an 8% preferred return.
No Directors of Electra participate in the above schemes.
At 30 September 2016 the value of 20% of the carried interest schemes which are affected in this way was 47 million.
Based on estimates of future cash flows in respect of the investments in these pools the actual net impact on the carried interest provision of the 20% reduction that will occur at 31 May 2017 is estimated to be immaterial and consequently no adjustment has been made.
The carried interest provision of 243 million will only become payable should sufficient proceeds be received from disposal of investments in the pools.
The timing of this is uncertain and may arise within a relatively short period.
Participants Investment From October 2006 the participants in the 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015 pools are required to invest 1% of the cost of each direct investment on a pari passu basis with Electra.
At 30 September 2016 the fair value of all investments currently held by the participants was 15,134,000 2015: 13,498,000.
At 31 May 2017 the Participants have the option to sell their Participants Investments to the Company at the higher of cost or valuation.
Had this option been exercised at 30 September 2016 its value would have been 15,936,000.
Electra Partners Club 2007 LP co-investment agreement In November 2007, Electra entered into a co-investment agreement with Electra Partners Club 2007 LP Club, a fund managed by Epiris Managers LLP.
The co-investment agreement required Electra to co-invest at the ratio of 2:1 in all Epiris investments in private equity opportunities in Western Europe where the combined investment of Electra and the Club would represent a controlling stake and where the combined equity investment is between 25 million to 75 million.
Both parties invested on the same terms and conditions.
The agreement allowed for variations to these arrangements in certain prescribed circumstances, for example, where investment would compromise Electras ability to qualify as an Investment Trust or where the Club would exceed certain concentration ratios.
Investments that arise from interests that Electra already held prior to the establishment of the Club are unaffected by these sharing arrangements.
These arrangements expired in May 2013.
Priority profit share Priority profit share for the year ended 30 September 2016 was 28,954,000 2015: 24,930,000.

From 1 April 2015 to 26 May 2016 the following changes were made: no fee was paid on cash: and the management fee on Non-Core listed and Primary Fund Investments was reduced to 1%.
On 26 May 2016 the Company served notice of termination of the Management and Investment Guideline Agreement on Epiris and as a consequence from 27 May 2016 priority profit share paid to the Manager was calculated at 1.5% per annum on the gross value of the Companys investment portfolio including cash but excluding any amounts committed to funds established and managed by Epiris.
In the year to 30 September 2016 5,206,000 2015: 3,582,000 deal fees were charged by Electra in relation to new investments.
These fees are accounted for within the investment income line in the Financial Statements.
Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements, Epiris is entitled to receive 50% of the aggregate deal fees in excess of abort costs which were 2,046,000 2015: 461,000.
This is achieved by increasing the priority profit share for the year by the relevant amount.
These amounts are shown in the table above.
In addition Epiris charged portfolio companies 1,704,000 in relation to directors and monitoring fees 2015: 1,659,000.
Termination Payment On 26 May 2016 the Company served notice of termination of the Management and Investment Guideline Agreement on Epiris.
This termination becomes effective on 31 May 2017.
Under the terms of their contract Epiris are entitled to compensation based on the priority profit share received in the year to 31 May 2017.
This has been estimated to be 32,000,000.
This estimate is based on the actual PPS that has been paid from 1 June 2016 up to 30 September 2016.
This accounts for approximately 34% of the 32,000,000 provision.
The balance is based on estimates of reasonable likely future cash flows including investment realisations, and material payments.
Sherborne Sherborne Investors Management LP Sherborne was appointed as adviser to the Company on 22 December 2015.
Their role was to advise the Company in connection with research and the formulation and making of proposals to the Board of Directors of the Company, and, in particular the Board of Directors Management Engagement Committee, for the purpose of monitoring and supervising the performance of Epiris.
Under the terms of the contract Sherborne are not entitled to a fee but are entitled to be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses.
In the year ended 30 September 2016 the Company paid Sherborne 88,000 as reimbursement for travel and subsistence costs.
Edward Bramson is a managing member of Sherborne Investors Management LP.

Remuneration Disclosure The AIFMD requires certain disclosures to be made in relation to the remuneration of the Managers staff during its last financial year ended 31 March 2016.
Year ended 31 March 2016 000 Remuneration paid by the Manager to its partners 3,543 3,543 Carried Interest paid to the partners of the Manager 8,765 8,765 Total 12,308 12,308 In accordance with the FCAs guidance on the AIFMD remuneration code, the information above relates only to the financial year of Epiris ended 31 March 2016, substantially all of which relates to the management of Electra.
As this is the first full financial year following the Managers variation of permission to act as an AIFM under the AIFMD which took effect from 11 July 2014 and which involved a substantial reorganisation of Epiris group structure, it would not be useful to provide a remuneration disclosure for the previous financial year of Epiris because it would not provide a reliable basis for a like-for-like comparison.
The remuneration paid by Manager in the period was fixed remuneration with no variable remuneration being paid and the number of beneficiaries was eight for the year ended 31 March 2016.
All those concerned are partners of the Manager who are also its senior management.
Following successful disposals made during the year ended 31 March 2016 the same individuals received aggregate profit distributions as set out above in respect of their carried interest in partnerships through which Electra invests.
Remuneration Policy Epiris has reviewed its remuneration policies and procedures in order to ensure that incentives are aligned with the detailed requirements of AIFMD.
Epiris remuneration policy includes measures to avoid conflicts of interest such as: The remuneration of all the Managers partners is in the form of fixed drawings of profit allocations determined by a formula fixed in advance of any annual period in which remuneration is paid.
No variable or performance related remuneration is paid to any of the Managers partners.
The Manager will not pay remuneration for potential future revenues whose timing and likelihood remain uncertain.

IFRS comprises standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC as adopted in the European Union as at 30 September 2016.
In order to reflect the activities of an investment trust company, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Income Statement.
In analysing total income between capital and revenue returns, the Directors have followed the guidance contained in the Statement of Recommended Practice for investment companies issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009 the SORP.
The recommendations of the SORP which have been followed include: Realised and unrealised profits or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments classified as held at fair value through profit or loss should be shown in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Realised gains are taken to the realised reserves in equity and unrealised gains are transferred to the unrealised reserves in equity.
Returns on any share or debt security whether in respect of dividends, interest or otherwise should be shown in the revenue column of the income statement.
The total of the revenue column of the Income Statement is taken to the revenue reserve in equity.
The Board should determine whether the indirect costs of generating capital gains should also be shown in the capital column of the Income Statement.
If the Board decides that this should be so, the management fee should be allocated between revenue and capital in accordance with the Boards expected long term split of returns, and other expenses should be charged to capital only to the extent that a clear connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of investments can be demonstrated.
The Board has decided that the Company should continue to charge priority profit share and finance costs, as revenue items for the year ended 30 September 2016.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and accordingly has not presented a separate parent company income statement.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of certain assets at fair value, as disclosed in the Principles of Valuation of Investments.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 101 Further Information Governance Financial Statements The Managers Report Strategic and Business Review Overview 23 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Application of New Standards The accounting policies used are consistent with those applied in the last annual Financial Statements, as amended to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments, and interpretations which became effective in the year.
During the year there were no relevant standards, amendments and interpretations that became effective for the first time.
Additionally a number of standards have been issued but are not yet adopted by the EU and so are not available for early adoption.
The most significant of these is IFRS 9 Financial Instruments along with related amendments to other IFRSs and the impact on the Group is being reviewed None of these standards, amendments and interpretations are presently expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Where subsidiaries are acquired or sold during the year their results are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition and up to the date of disposal respectively.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control, as defined by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The amendments to IFRS 10 and 12 define an investment entity and include an exception from the consolidation requirements for investment entities.
The Company has been deemed to meet the definition of an investment entity per IFRS 10 as the following conditions exist The Company has multiple unrelated investors which are not related parties, and holds multiple investments.
Ownership interests in the Company are exposed to variable returns from changes in the fair value of the Companys net assets.
The Company has obtained funds for the purpose of providing investors with investment management services.
The Companys business purpose is investing solely for returns from capital appreciation and investment income.
The performance of investments are measured and evaluated on a fair value basis.
Electra Private Equity PLC does not consolidate the investment entities it controls.
The principal subsidiaries comprise wholly owned companies and near wholly owned investment holding limited partnerships.
They provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice and hold investments in managed assets.
The primary purpose of these entities is to provide investment related services that relate to the Companys investment activities and therefore they are not considered to be investment entities.
These subsidiaries continue to be consolidated.
Investments The Board has appointed Epiris, an independent investment manager, under a contract of full discretionary management to manage the investments of the Company.
This is effected through the Management and Investment Guideline Agreement and the relevant limited partnership agreements of the investment holding limited partnerships through which the Company makes its investments.
Under the agreements, Epiris as Manager has full power to exercise the voting rights attaching to any of the Companys investments without reference to the Board.
Consequently, the Company does not have the power to participate in or govern the financial and operating policies of any of its investments and therefore even where the holding is greater than 50% of the equity or between 20% and 50% of the equity, investments are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method respectively.
The Group has created other limited partnerships and corporate entities to hold the underlying portfolio assets.
The purpose of the limited partnerships and corporate holding vehicles is to invest for investment income and capital appreciation.
These partnerships meet the definition of an investment entity and are classified at fair value through profit and loss with movements in fair value being recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
102 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 23 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Purchases and sales of listed investments are recognised on the trade date where a contract exists whose terms require delivery within a time frame determined by the relevant market.
Purchases and sales of unlisted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.
Investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss described in the Financial Statements as investments held at fair value and are subsequently measured at reporting dates at fair value.
The fair value of direct unquoted investments is calculated in accordance with the Principles of Valuation of Investments below.
Changes in the fair value of investments are recognised in the Income Statement through the capital column.
Principles of Valuation of Investments i General In valuing investments, Epiris estimates the Fair Value of each investment at the reporting date in accordance with IFRS 13 and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation IPEV Guidelines.
Fair Value is the price for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms-length transaction.
In estimating Fair Value, the Manager applies a valuation technique which is appropriate in light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment and uses reasonable current market data and inputs combined with judgement and assumptions.
Valuation techniques are applied consistently from one reporting date to another except where a change in technique results in a better estimate of Fair Value.
The Manager tests its valuation techniques using a tool known as calibration.
This compares the inputs and assumptions used in estimating Fair Value on the reporting date to those used on previous reporting dates and to those underlying the initial entry price of an investment in order to ensure that the inputs and assumptions used on the reporting date are consistent with those used previously.
In general, the Manager will: determine the enterprise value of the investee company in question using one of a range of valuation techniques: adjust the enterprise value for factors that would normally be taken into account such as surplus assets, excess liabilities or other contingencies or relevant factors: and apportion the resulting amount between the investee companys relevant financial instruments according to their ranking and taking into account the effect of any instrument that may dilute the economic entitlement of a given instrument.
ii Unlisted Investments In respect of each unlisted investment the Manager selects one or more of the following valuation techniques: A market approach, based on the price of the recent investment, earnings multiples or industry valuation benchmarks: An income approach, employing a discounted cash flow technique: and A replacement cost approach valuing the net assets of the portfolio company.
In assessing whether a methodology is appropriate the Manager maximises the use of techniques that draw heavily on observable market-based measures of risk and return.
Price of Recent Investment Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost may provide a good indication of Fair Value.
Using the Price of Recent Investment technique is not a default and at each reporting date the Fair Value of recent investments is estimated to assess whether changes or events subsequent to the relevant transaction would imply a change in the investments Fair Value.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 103 Further Information Governance Financial Statements The Managers Report Strategic and Business Review Overview 23 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Multiple Typically the Manager uses an earnings multiple technique.
This involves the application of an appropriate and reasonable multiple to the maintainable earnings of an investee company.
The Manager usually derives a multiple by reference to current market-based multiples, reflected in the market valuations of quoted comparable companies or the price at which comparable companies have changed ownership.
Differences between these market-based multiples and the investee company being valued are reflected by adjusting the multiple for points of difference which might affect the risk and earnings growth prospects which underpin the earnings multiple.
Such points of difference might include the relative size and diversity of the entities, rate of earnings growth, reliance on a small number of key employees, diversity of product ranges, diversity and quality of customer base, level of borrowing, any other reason the quality of earnings may differ, and risks arising from the lack of marketability of the shares.
In respect of maintainable earnings, the Manager usually uses earnings for the most recent twelve month period adjusted if necessary to represent a reasonable estimate of maintainable earnings.
Such adjustments might include exceptional or non-recurring items, the impact of discontinued activities and acquisitions, or forecast material changes in earnings.
In some circumstances the Manager may apply a multiple to the net assets of a business, typically where the business value derives mainly from the underlying Fair Value of its assets rather than its earnings, such as property holding companies.
Discounted Cash Flow The Discounted Cash Flow technique involves deriving the value of a business or an investment by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows from that business or investment using reasonable assumptions and estimations of expected future cash flows, the terminal value or maturity amount and date, and the appropriate risk-adjusted rate that captures the risk inherent to the business or investment.
The Manager usually uses the Discounted Cash Flow technique in respect of certain debt investments or where the realisation of an investment is imminent with the pricing of the relevant transaction being substantially agreed such that the technique is likely to be the most appropriate one.
iii Listed Investments The Fair Value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and transactions for an asset take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an on-going basis.
The quoted market price used for listed financial instruments held by the Group is the bid price on the reporting date.
iv Fund Investments In determining the Fair Value of investments in funds managed by parties other than Epiris, the Manager usually uses the net asset value of the fund as reported by the manager as the starting point.
The Manager may make adjustments to the reported net asset value to reflect, for example, purchases and sales occurring between the funds measurement date and the reporting date, or any other facts or circumstances which might impact the Fair Value of the fund.
v Other Investments Liquidity funds are held at the current Fair Value of the note.
vi Subsidiary Undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Company Balance Sheet at the Fair Value of the subsidiary.
vii Accrued Income Accrued income is included within investment valuations.
104 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 23 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on its borrowings.
This is achieved by the use of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
All derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of currency swaps and interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and exchange rates.
All changes in the fair value of financial instruments are accounted for in the Income Statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months.
Foreign Currencies The Groups presentational currency and the Companys functional and presentational currency is pounds sterling sterling, since that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currencies of the Groups respective entities at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are recognised through the Income Statement.
At each balance sheet date assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of the equity and reserves of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than sterling, are recognised directly in the Translation Reserve in equity.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Income Statement for the year.
Investment Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are accounted on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted, are accounted when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield when it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group.
Where income accruals previously recognised, but not received, are no longer considered to be reasonably expected to be received, either through investee company restructuring or doubt over its receipt, then these amounts are reversed through expenses.
Income distributions from limited partnership funds are recognised when the right to distribution is established.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Finance Costs Costs of borrowings are expensed as revenue items through the Income Statement as they accrue on an effective interest rate basis.
Any costs incurred which were not directly related to the borrowing facility are expensed in the revenue account.
Priority Profit Share The majority of the investments are made by the Company through investment holding limited partnerships managed by Epiris.
Under the terms of the relevant limited partnership agreements the general partner is entitled to appropriate, as a first charge on the net income or net capital gains of the limited partnerships, an amount equivalent to its priority profit share.
In periods in which the investment holding limited partnerships have not yet earned sufficient net income or net capital gain to satisfy this priority profit share the entitlement is carried forward to the following period.
In all instances the cash amount paid to the general partner in each period is equivalent to the priority profit share.
The priority profit share is charged wholly to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 105 Further Information Governance Financial Statements The Managers Report Strategic and Business Review Overview 23 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expense loss is allocated between capital and revenue on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Zero Dividend Preference Shares Zero Dividend Preference Shares which exhibit the characteristics of debt were recognised as liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position in accordance with IAS 32.
After initial recognition, these liabilities were measured at amortised cost, which represented the initial net proceeds from the issuance after issue costs plus the accrued entitlement to the balance sheet date.
The accrued entitlement was calculated as the difference between the proceeds on the issue of these shares and the redemption amount at maturity and was charged as interest expense over the life of these shares using the effective interest method.
In accordance with the AIC SORP this interest expense was allocated to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Convertible Bonds The Bond, in accordance with IFRS, was treated as a compound financial instrument that contained both a liability and an equity component.
The economic effect of issuing the instrument was substantially the same as issuing both a debt instrument with an obligation to payment of interest and principal assuming it was not converted and an equity instrument a written call option granting the holder the right for a specified period of time to convert into a fixed number of ordinary shares.
The proceeds from issuing Convertible Bonds were split on Electras Statement of Financial Position into its constituent parts of debt and equity in accordance with the requirement of IFRS.
The fair value of the debt element of the Bond was calculated by using a market rate of interest for a similar borrowing that did not include an equity component or a conversion option.
The rate used for these purposes was 9.9%, which, using discounted cash flow, gave a fair value for the debt component of 73 million.
The fair value of the equity element was calculated by deducting the fair value of debt from the issue value of the Bond.
Finance costs were taken to the Income Statement and were calculated as the yield to maturity of the fair value of the debt component of the Bond.
On conversion the value of the Bonds converted was debited to long-term liabilities.
The nominal value of the ordinary shares issued on conversion was credited to share capital and the balance representing the excess of conversion proceeds over nominal value of the shares was credited to the share premium account.
On conversion, the fair value of the equity element was credited to the revenue reserve and debited to other reserves.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made.
The provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Changes in provisions are recognised in the Income Statement.
The provision for the incentive schemes is based on the valuation of investments as at the balance sheet date.
The incentive scheme is charged to the capital column of the Income Statement as a direct cost.
Revenue and Capital Reserves Net Capital return is taken to the Capital Reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The net revenue return is taken to the Revenue Reserve.
106 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 23 Basis of Accounting and Significant Accounting Policies continued Bank Loans Bank loans were initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the loan.
After initial recognition, these were subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which was the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the liabilities.
Amortised cost was calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments more than 30 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within selling and marketing costs.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against selling and marketing costs in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share Capital Ordinary shares issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds or fair value received with the excess of the amount received over nominal value being credited to the share premium account.
Direct issue costs net of tax are deducted from equity.
Going Concern The Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.
Key Estimates and Assumptions Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial information are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments, the value of carried interest provisions.
These are valued by Epiris in accordance with IFRS 13 and the IPEV Guidelines.
Judgement is required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology under this standard and subsequently in determining the inputs into the valuation model used.
These judgements include making assessments of the future earnings potential of portfolio companies, appropriate earnings multiples to apply, and adjustments to comparable multiples.
See Note 23 for Principles of Valuation of Investments on pages 103 to 104.
See Note 21 for further details on carried interest schemes and the termination payment on pages 96 to 100.
Additionally, in this period a key estimate is the assessment of the financial impact of the termination of the management contract with Epiris.
The key estimates associated with this are the value of the provision for the termination payment and the impact on the carried interest provision.
The estimates and assumptions used to determine these provisions are discussed more fully in Note 21 on pages 96 to 100.
