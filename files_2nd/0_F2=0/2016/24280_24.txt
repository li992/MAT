General information GCP Infrastructure Investments Limited is a public company incorporated and domiciled in Jersey on 21 May 2010 with registration number 105775.
The Company is governed by the provisions of the Law and the CIF Law.
The Company merged with its former subsidiary, GCP Asset Holdings Limited on 30 September 2015.
The Company is a closed-ended investment company incorporated under the laws of Jersey and its ordinary shares are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Company makes infrastructure investments through acquiring or acquiring interests in debt instruments issued by infrastructure project companies or by their existing lenders or holding vehicles that are, or are expected to be, in receipt of public sector backed cash flows.
Significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation These financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the year as required by IFRS and as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.
New standards, amendments and interpretations There are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards which have been published and are mandatory for the Companys accounting periods beginning after 1 October 2016 or later periods, but the Company has decided not to early adopt them.
The following standards are the most relevant to the Company: Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 : the objective of the Amendments is to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 : the objective of IFRS 15 is to establish the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer: and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 : the new financial instruments impairment requirements provide users with useful information about an entitys expected credit losses on financial instruments.
These new requirements incorporate the classification and measurement requirements, the impairment requirements and the general hedge accounting requirements.
In addition to the above, there are no new IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.
Going concern The Directors have made an assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and are satisfied that the Company has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In addition to a going concern assessment, the Directors have undertaken a longer-term assessment of the Company, the results of which can be seen on page 33 in the viability statement.
2.2 Significant accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Directors of the Company to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts recognised in the financial statements.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability in the future.
The valuation of financial investments requires a significant degree of judgement and is dependent on assumptions and estimates which are significant to the reported amounts recognised in the financial statements see note 19.
GCP Infrastructure Investments Limited  60 Introduction Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Directors have determined that the SPVs through which the Company invests fall under the control of the Company in accordance with the control criteria prescribed by IFRS 10 and therefore meet the definition of subsidiaries.
In addition the Directors continue to hold the view that the Company meets the definition of an investment entity and therefore can measure and present the SPVs at fair value through profit or loss.
As the investments in the SPVs are in the form of debt instruments, judgement has been involved in determining the unit of account for the measurement of these investments.
This process requires a significant degree of judgement taking into account the complexity of the structure of the Company and extent of investment activities see note 11.
2.3 a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured in the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The primary objective of the Company is to generate returns in Pound Sterling, its capital-raising currency.
The Companys performance is evaluated in Pound Sterling.
Therefore, the Directors consider Pound Sterling as the currency that most faithfully represents the economic effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions and have adopted it as the Companys presentation currency.
All values have been rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
2.3 b Segmental information For management purposes, the Company is organised into one main operating segment.
All of the Companys activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent on the others.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment.
The financial results from this segment are equivalent to the financial statements of the Company as a whole.

Accounting for subsidiaries The Companys investments are made through a number of SPVs see note 25 which are domiciled in the UK.
The Company does not hold equity interests in these SPVs, the Investment Adviser holds a nominal equity position in each SPV and operates the SPVs on a day-to-day basis.
The Company owns 100% of the loan notes issued by the SPVs with the exception of GCP Rooftop Solar 6 Limited 37.7% and FHW Dalmore Salford Pendleton Housing Plc 13.2%.
During the year, the Directors made an assessment in regard to whether the Company controls the SPVs and whether the SPVs meet the definition of subsidiary companies in accordance with the definition of IFRS 10.
The Directors have made an assessment on whether the Company as an investor controls the SPVs under each of the criteria within IFRS 10.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Company demonstrates all three of the criteria for all SPVs which therefore determines these SPVs to be considered subsidiary companies within the definition of IFRS 10 with the exception of GCP Rooftop Solar 6 Limited and Salford Pendleton Housing Limited which are considered to be associates as the Company has significant influence over the relevant activities of the SPV through similar arrangements.
Assessment as an investment entity Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to measure their subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss rather than consolidate the entities.
The criteria which define an investment entity are, as follows: an entity that obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment services: an entity that commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both: and an entity that measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
GCP Infrastructure Investments Limited  65 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2016 11.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss continued Assessment as an investment entity continued The Directors have concluded that the Company continues to meet the characteristics of an investment entity, in that it has more than one investor and its investors are not related parties: holds a portfolio of investments, predominantly in the form of loan securities which generates returns through interest income and capital appreciation: the Company reports to its investors via quarterly investor information, and to its management, via internal management reports, on a fair value basis.
All investments are reported at fair value to the extent allowed by IFRS in the Companys annual reports.
Accounting policy Holdings of the loan notes held by the Company are shown as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in the statement of financial position which in the opinion of the Directors represent the fair value of the SPVs as any other net assets held in the SPVs at year end are immaterial.
The Company recognises a financial asset or a financial liability when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: and either a the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company transfers its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Companys continuing involvement in the asset.
The Company derecognises a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value.
All transaction costs for such instruments are recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
After initial measurement, the Company measures financial instruments which are classified as fair value through profit or loss at fair value.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of those financial instruments are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques include using recent arms length market transactions, referenced to appropriate current market data, and discounted cash flow analysis, at all times making as much use of available and supportable market data as possible.
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in note 19.

These guidelines are the subject of regular operational reviews undertaken by the Investment Adviser to ensure that the Companys policies are adhered to as it is the Investment Advisers duty to identify and assist in the control of risk.
The Investment Adviser reports regularly to the Directors who have ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management approach.
The Investment Adviser and the Directors ensure that all investment activity is performed in accordance with the investment guidelines.
The Companys investment activities expose it to various types of risks that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
Risk is inherent in the Companys activities and it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring.
The financial risks to which the Company is exposed include market risk which includes other price risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
19.3 Market risk There is a risk that market movements in interest rates, credit markets and observable yields may decrease or increase the fair value of the Companys financial assets without regard to the assets underlying performance.
The fair value of the Companys financial assets is measured and monitored on a quarterly basis by the Investment Adviser with the assistance of the Valuation Agent.
The Valuation Agent considers the movements in comparable credit markets and publicly available information around each project in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment.
The valuation principles used are based on a discounted cash flow methodology.
A fair value for each asset acquired by the Company is calculated by applying a relevant market discount rate to the contractual cash flows expected to arise from each asset.
The Valuation Agent determines the discount rate that it believes the market would reasonably apply to each investment taking into account, inter alia, the following significant inputs: Pound Sterling interest rates: movements of comparable credit markets: and observable yields on other comparable instruments.
In addition, the following are also considered as part of the overall valuation process: general infrastructure market activity and investor sentiment: and changes to the economic, legal, taxation or regulatory environment.
The Valuation Agent exercises its judgement in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment.
Given that the investments of the Company are generally fixed-income debt instruments in some cases with elements of inflation protection or other investments with a similar economic effect, the focus of the Valuation Agent is on assessing the likelihood of any interruptions to the debt service payments, in light of the operational performance of the underlying asset.
The valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the subsequent NAV is reviewed and approved by the Directors on a quarterly basis previously approved on a monthly basis prior to 1 April 2016.
The table below shows how changes in discount rate affect the changes in the valuation of financial assets at fair value.
The range of discount rates used reflects the Investment Advisers view of a reasonable expectation of valuation movements across the portfolio in a twelve-month period.
30 September 2016 Change in discount rate 0.50% 0.25% 0.00% 0.25% 0.50% Value of financial assets at fair value 000 674,953 687,120 699,682 712,656 726,059 Change in value of financial assets at fair value 000 24,729 12,562 12,974 26,377 As at 30 September 2016, the discount rates used in the valuation of financial assets ranged from 6.75% to 10.30%.
GCP Infrastructure Investments Limited  72 Introduction Strategic report Governance Financial statements 30 September 2015 Change in discount rate 0.50% 0.25% 0.00% 0.25% 0.50% Value of financial assets at fair value 000 635,706 646,554 657,730 669,248 681,122 Change in value of financial assets at fair value 000 22,023 11,176 11,518 23,392 As at 30 September 2015, the discount rates used in the valuation of financial assets ranged from 6.5% to 10.5%.
19.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk has the following effect: Fair value of financial assets Interest rates are one of the factors which the Valuation Agent takes into account when valuing the financial assets.
Future cash flows The Company primarily invests in senior and subordinated debt instruments of infrastructure project companies.
The financial assets have fixed interest rate coupons, albeit with some inflation protection, and as such movements in interest rates will not directly affect the future cash flows payable to the Company.
Interest rate hedging may be carried out to seek to provide protection against falling interest rates in relation to assets that do not have a minimum fixed rate of return acceptable to the Company in line with its investment policy and strategy.
Where the debt instrument is subordinated, the Company is indirectly exposed to the gearing of the infrastructure project companies.
The Investment Adviser ensures as part of its due diligence that the project company debt ranking senior to the Companys investment has been hedged against movement in interest rates where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps.
Borrowings During the year the Company made use of its Facility with RBSI, which was used to finance investments made by the Company.
Details of the RBSI Facility are given in note 16.
Any potential financial impact of movements in interest rates on the cost of borrowings to the Company is mitigated by the short-term nature of such borrowings.
19.5 Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The assets classified at fair value through profit or loss do not have a published credit rating, however, the Investment Adviser monitors the financial position and performance of the project companies on a regular basis to ensure that credit risk is appropriately managed.
The Company is exposed to differing levels of credit risk on all its assets.
Per the statement of financial position, the Companys total exposure to credit risk is 752 million 2015: 664 million being the balance of total assets less prepayments.
As explained in note 15, cash is held at a number of financial institutions to spread credit risk, with cash awaiting investment being held on behalf of the Company at banks which carry a minimum rating of A-1, P-1 or F-1 from Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch respectively or in one or more similarly rated money market or short-dated gilt funds.
Before an investment decision is made the Investment Adviser performs extensive due diligence complemented by professional third party advisers, including technical advisers, financial and legal advisers and valuation and insurance experts.
After an investment is made the Investment Adviser uses detailed cash flow forecasts to assess the continued credit worthiness of project companies and their ability to pay all costs as they fall due.
The forecasts are regularly updated with information provided by the project companies in order to monitor ongoing financial performance.
The project companies receive a significant portion of revenue from government departments and public sector or local authority clients.
The project companies are also reliant on their subcontractors, particularly facilities managers, continuing to perform their service delivery obligations such that revenues are not disrupted.
The credit standing of each significant subcontractor is monitored on an ongoing basis, and period end significant exposures are reported to the Directors quarterly.
GCP Infrastructure Investments Limited  73 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2016 19.
Financial instruments continued 19.5 Credit risk continued The concentration of credit risk to any individual project did not exceed 10% of the Companys portfolio as at the year end.
The Investment Advisor also monitors the concentration of risk based upon the nature of each underlying project.
The concentration of credit risk associated with counterparties is deemed to be low.
The counterparties are typically public sector entities which generate pre-determined, long term, public sector backed revenues in the form of subsidy payments FiT and ROCs payments for renewables transactions or unitary charge payments for PFI transactions.
In the view of the Investment Adviser and Board, the UK Government has both the ability and willingness to satisfy its obligations to these public sector entities.
The credit risk associated with each project company is further mitigated because the cash flows receivable are secured over the assets of the project company, which in turn has security over the assets of the underlying projects.
The debt instruments held by the Company are held at fair value, and the credit risk associated with these investments is one of the factors which the Valuation Agent takes into account when valuing the financial assets.
The Investment Advisor regularly monitors the concentration of risk based upon the nature of each underlying project to ensure appropriate diversification and risk remains within acceptable parameters.
Changes in credit risk affect the discount rate.
The sensitivity of the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is disclosed on page 72.
The Directors have assessed the credit quality of the portfolio at the year end and based on the parameters set out above are satisfied that the credit quality remains within an acceptable range for long-dated debt.
19.6 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Exposure to liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Company could be required to pay its liabilities or redeem its shares earlier than expected.
The Companys objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank deposits and interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The following table analyses all of the Companys assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from 30 September 2016 to the contractual maturity date.
The Directors have elected to present both assets and liabilities in the liquidity disclosure below to illustrate the net liquidity exposure of the Company.
The cash flows are on an undiscounted basis.

These valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the subsequent NAV is reviewed and approved by the Directors on a quarterly basis prior to 1 April 2016, the NAV was approved monthly.
The basis for the Valuation Agents valuations is described in note 19.3.
Fair value measurements Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following fair value hierarchy levels depending on whether their fair value is based on: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
An investment is always categorised as Level 1, 2 or 3 in its entirety.
In certain cases, the fair value measurement for an investment may use a number of different inputs that fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In such cases, an investment level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgement and is specific to the investment.
The table below summarises all securities held by the Company based on the fair valuation technique adopted: 30 September 30 September Fair value 2016 2015 hierarchy 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Loan notes PFI and renewables excluding biomass Level 2 520,296 492,299 Loan notes biomass Level 3 179,386 165,431 GCP Infrastructure Investments Limited  75 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2016 19.
Financial instruments continued 19.7 Fair values of financial assets continued Fair value measurements continued The Directors have classified the financial instruments as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on whether or not there is a consistent data set of comparable and observable market transactions.
Due to the limited number of comparable and observable market transactions in the biomass sector, the Directors have classified the Companys investments in biomass projects as Level 3.
Discount rates of 9.7% and 9.84% were applied to the two investments secured against underperforming biomass projects with impaired expected future cash flows.
The following table shows a reconciliation of all movements in the fair value of financial instruments categorised within Level 3 between the beginning and end of the year: 30 September 30 September 2016 2015 000 000 Opening balance 165,431 389,036 Purchases 29,827 224,453 Repayments 7,125 20,819 Unrealised gain on investments at fair value through profit or loss 1,081 Unrealised loss on investments at fair value through profit or loss 9,828 5,011 Decrease in intercompany loan 70,066 Merger of subsidiary 657,725 Introduction of loan notes through merger 165,431 Closing balance 179,386 165,431 Prior to the merger on 30 September 2015, the investment in the subsidiary was considered to be Level 3.
For the Companys financial instruments categorised as Level 3, changing the discount rate used to value the underlying instruments alters the fair value.
A change in the discount rate used to value the Level 3 investments would have the following effect on profit before tax: 30 September 2016 Change in discount rate 0.50% 0.25% 0.00% 0.25% 0.50% Valuation of financial assets at fair value 000 173,882 176,600 179,386 182,245 185,176 Change in valuation of financial assets at fair value 000 5,504 2,786 2,858 5,789 In determining the discount rate for calculating the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, movements to Pound Sterling interest rates, comparable credit markets and the observable yield on comparable instruments could give rise to changes in the discount rate.
The Directors consider the inputs used in the valuation of investments and the appropriateness of their classification in the fair value hierarchy.
In particular the Directors are satisfied that significant inputs into the discount rate, other than in respect of biomass investments as noted above, are market observable.
Should the valuation approach change causing an investment to meet the characteristics of a different level of the fair value hierarchy, it will be reclassified accordingly.
During the period there were no transfers of investments between levels therefore, no further disclosure is considered necessary by the Directors.
