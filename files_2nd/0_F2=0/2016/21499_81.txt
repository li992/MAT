Overburden removal costs The process of removing overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits is referred to as stripping.

The determination of components assessment of the existence of reserves.
This policy is dependent on the mine plan and other factors, including the size, requires management to make certain estimates and shape and geotechnical aspects of an ore body.
The Group assumptions as to future events and circumstances, accounts for stripping activities as follows: in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established.
Any such estimates and Development stripping costs assumptions may change as new information becomes These are initial overburden removal costs incurred to obtain available.

under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery These costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised benefits access to mineral ores will flow to the Group and costs amount will be written off to the income statement.

All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and classified as assets under construction, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied.
The Group may use funds sourced from external parties to finance the acquisition and development of assets and operations.
Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing a qualifying asset are capitalised during the development phase.
Development expenditure is net of proceeds from the saleable material extracted during the development phase.
On completion of development, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassified as either plant and equipment or other mineral assets and depreciation commences.
Key judgements and estimates Development activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management.
Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project is economically viable.
In exercising this judgement, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances.
Estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available.
If, after having commenced the development activity, a judgement is made that a development asset is impaired, the appropriate amount will be written off to the income statement.
176 BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 5 Financial Statements 6 Additional information 7 Shareholder information 10 Property, plant and equipment continued Production stripping costs These are interburden removal costs incurred during the normal course of production activity, which commences after the first saleable minerals have been extracted from the component.
Production stripping costs can give rise to two benefits, the accounting for which is outlined below: Production stripping activity Benefits of stripping activity Extraction of ore inventory in current period.
Improved access to future ore extraction.
Period benefited Current period Future period s Recognition and When the benefits of stripping activities are realised When the benefits of stripping activities are improved measurement criteria in the form of inventory produced: the associated costs access to future ore: production costs are capitalised are recorded in accordance with the Groups inventory when all the following criteria are met: accounting policy.
the production stripping activity improves access to a specific component of the ore body and it is probable that economic benefit arising from the improved access to future ore production will be realised: the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified: costs associated with that component can be measured reliably.
Allocation of costs Production stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the production stripping asset using a life-of-component waste-to-ore or mineral contained strip ratio.
When the current strip ratio is greater than the estimated life-of-component ratio a portion of the stripping costs is capitalised to the production stripping asset.
Asset recognised from Inventory Other mineral assets within property, plant and stripping activity equipment.
Depreciation basis Not applicable On a  basis using the units of production method based on proven and probable reserves.
Key judgements and estimates The identification of components of an ore body, as well as estimation of stripping ratios and mineral reserves by component require critical accounting judgements and estimates to be made by management.
Changes to estimates related to life-of-component waste-to-ore or mineral contained strip ratios and the expected ore production from identified components are accounted for prospectively and may affect depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Where assets are dedicated to a mine or petroleum lease, the below useful lives are subject to the lesser of the asset categorys useful life and the life of the mine or petroleum lease, unless those assets are readily transferable to another productive mine or lease.
Depreciation The estimation of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods require significant management judgement and are reviewed annually.
Any changes to useful lives may affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Depreciation of assets, other than land, assets under construction and capitalised exploration and evaluation that are not depreciated, is calculated using either the straight-line SL method or units of production UoP method, net of residual values, over the estimated useful lives of specific assets.
The depreciation method and rates applied to specific assets reflect the pattern in which the assets benefits are expected to be used by the Group.
The table below summarises the principal depreciation methods and rates applied to major asset categories by the Group.
