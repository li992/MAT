Notes to the Annual Financial Statements For the 52 weeks ended 2 July 2016 1 Segmental reporting The Group has one reportable segment, in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which is the retail of homewares in the UK.
Customers access the Groups offer across multiple channels and often their journey involves more than one channel.
Therefore internal reporting focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc.
Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a monthly basis.
Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the period.

indd 107 12 10 2016 09:55:25 financials Notes to the Annual Financial Statements CONTINUED For the 52 weeks ended 2 July 2016 16 Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
A formal process for reviewing and managing risk in the business is in place.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as foreign exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties.
The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of A credit rating.
Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to 25m for any individual party.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets.
At the period end the maximum exposure is detailed in the table below.
2016 2015 m m Cash and cash equivalents 14.9 16.2 Trade and other receivables 3.2 3.2 Derivative financial instruments 7.4 Total financial assets 25.5 19.4 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances.
The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts.
The Groups available facilities can be found in note 17.
The table below analyses estimated future contractual cash flows in respect of the Groups financial liabilities, according to the earliest date on which the Group could be required to settle the liability.
Floating rate interest payments are estimated based on market interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Less than One to Two to Total one year two years five years At 2 July 2016 m m m m Borrowings including interest 100.1 1.3 1.3 97.5 Trade and other payables 52.9 52.8 0.1 Less than One to Two to Total one year two years five years At 4 July 2015 m m m m Borrowings including interest 97.4 1.3 1.3 94.8 Trading and net settled derivative financial instruments 0.3 0.3 Trade and other payables 51.7 51.6 0.1 Interest rate risk The Groups bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants.
The Group will continue to monitor movements in the interest rate swap market.
At the year end if Libor interest rates had been 10 basis points higher lower with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have been 0.1m lower higher 2015: 0.1m as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
indd 108 12 10 2016 09:55:25 16 Financial risk management continued Foreign currency risk All of the Groups revenues are in sterling.
The majority of purchases are also in sterling, but some goods purchased direct from overseas suppliers are paid for in US dollars, accounting for just under 20% of stock purchases in the period ended 2 July 2016.
The Group uses various means to cover its exposure to US dollars: holding US dollar cash balances and taking out forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars.
All the Groups foreign exchange transactions are designed to satisfy US dollar denominated liabilities.
The maximum level of hedging coverage which will be undertaken is 100% of anticipated expenditure on a three month horizon, stepping down to 75% on a nine to 12 month horizon.
Coverage beyond 12 months is minimal.
Cash flow hedges are in place to manage foreign exchange rate risk arising from forecast purchases denominated in US dollars.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of US dollar foreign exchange forward contracts held in cash flow hedges was 7.2m asset 2015: 0.3m liability which relates to a commitment to purchase $90.5m for a fixed sterling amount.
A fair value movement of 10.3m 2015: 1.0m was recognised in other comprehensive income and no ineffectiveness 2015: nil was noted on cash flow hedges during the period.
In the period, a gain of 2.9m 2015: 1.7m loss was recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve to inventory to offset foreign exchange movements on purchases.
The remaining hedge reserve balance will be recycled to the income statement to offset future purchases occurring after the balance sheet date, the majority of which expire in the next 12 months.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the period end were $0.4m 2015: $0.3m.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group could seek to minimise the impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods, renegotiating terms with suppliers or sourcing from alternative markets.
At the year end if GBP had strengthened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have been 0.2m higher 2015: 0.4m as a result of foreign exchange gains on translation of USD denominated trade payables compensated by foreign exchange losses on translation of USD cash and cash equivalents.
Other components of equity would have been 5.0m lower 2015: 5.9m lower as a result of a decrease in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.
Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been 0.2m lower 2015: nil and other components of equity would have been 6.1m higher 2015: 7.2m higher.
The US dollar period end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.3265 2015: 1.5603.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying value.
The fair value of foreign currency contracts are amounts required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the period.
Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: z Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: z Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and z Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, based on observable market data.

The Boards objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to optimise returns to shareholders.
The Boards policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development.
The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.
During FY15, the Board reviewed its policy on capital structure and dividends.
The original policy was established at the time of the flotation of the Company in 2006 and in the Boards opinion has ceased to reflect the scale of the business and its consistent track record of cash generation over many years.
Accordingly, the Board determined that the Group will operate with a modest amount of leverage such that net debt should fall within the range of 0.25 to 0.75 times the last 12 months EBITDA.
In order to fund the ongoing debt, the Group entered into an arrangement with a syndicate of three major banks for the provision of a 150 million revolving credit facility, expiring on 9 February 2020.
