We also provide 243 Selected financial data information for shareholders on subjects 245 Financial and operational statistics such as dividends and location.
We have 248 Information for shareholders also included a glossary of terms we use in 264 Cross reference to Form 20-F this report.
268 Glossary of terms 240 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specific items.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
ThenonGAAP measures we use are: the trend in underlying revenue excluding transit, and in underlying operating costs excluding transit, as well as in reported and adjusted EBITDA: reported and normalised free cash flow: and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specific items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
This presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and or prior years include acquisitions disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, historical insurance or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years.
In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as specific items.
Specific items are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Trends in underlying revenue and operating costs Underlying revenue and underlying operating costs are measures which seek to reflect the underlying performance of the group that will contribute to longterm sustainable profitable growth.
As such they exclude the impact of acquisitions or disposals, foreign exchange movements and specific items.
We focus on the trends in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, as transit traffic is lowmargin and isaffected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
A reconciliation from the increase in reported revenue and in reported operating costs, the most directly comparable IFRS measures, to the increase in underlying revenue and underlying operating costs excluding transit, is set out below.

EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
Within the lines of business we may also consider our performance using an underlying EBITDA measure, which additionally excludes the impact of acquisitions and disposals and foreign exchange.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and adjusted group EBITDA, is set out below.
Areconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

b Specific items are set out in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
We disclose reported earnings per share, both basic and diluted, in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
Free cash flow Normalised free cash flow is one of the groups key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured.
Normalised free cash flow is defined as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less: cash flows from financing activities except net interest paid, the acquisition or disposal of group undertakings, the net sale of shortterm investments and excluding: the cash impact of specific items, purchases oftelecommunications licences, and the cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments.
For nontax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis.
Normalised free cash flow is primarily a liquidity measure.
However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reflects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and financing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outflows associated with investing in our infrastructure and financing our operations.
In addition, normalised free cash flow excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, and repayment and raising of debt.
Normalised free cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.
242 BT Group plc Annual Report 2016 A reconciliation from net cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and normalised free cash flow, is set out below.
2016 2015 2014 Year ended 31 March m m m Net cash inflow from operating activities 5,179 4,796 4,796 Add back pension deficit payments 880 876 325 Included in cash flows from investing activities Net capital expenditure 2,459 2,318 2,346 Interest received 10 10 6 Sales of non-current financial assets and dividend received from associates and joint ventures 17 8 4 Included in cash flows from financing activities Interest paid 558 590 614 Reported free cash flow 3,069 2,782 2,171 Net cash outflow from specific items 232 154 356 Cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments 203 106 77 Normalised free cash flow 3,098 2,830 2,450 Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and noncurrent, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured as the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Our net debt calculation starts from the expected future undiscounted cash flows that should arise when our financial instruments mature.
We adjust these cash flows to reflect hedged risks that are remeasured under fair value hedges, as well as for the impact of the effective interest method.
Currency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swap rates where hedged.
Net debt is a measure of the groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the groups cash position and its indebtedness.
The use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not defined in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and noncurrent, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from these to net debt is given below.
