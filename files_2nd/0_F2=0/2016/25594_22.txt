period in a manner that reflects the flow of content Intersegment revenue, which is earned on arms length terms, is generated from the supply of ITV Studios programmes delivered top-up to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily on the ITV Network.
This revenue stream is a measure which forms part of the Groups strategic priority of building a strong international content business, as producing and retaining rights to the shows broadcast on the ITV Network benefits the Group further from subsequent international content and format sales.
In preparing the segment information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable segments on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each segment.
This is consistent with the basis of reporting to the Board of Directors.

This agency is the only customer which individually represents over 10% of the Groups revenue.
Revenue of approximately 552 million 2015: 576 million was derived from this customer.
This revenue is attributable to the Broadcast & Online segment.
Broadcast & Online The Group operates the largest commercial family of channels in the UK and delivers content through multiple platforms.
In addition to linear television broadcast, the Group delivers its content on the ITV Hub, pay platforms, and through direct content deals.

125 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued Keeping This section sets out the Groups tax accounting policies, the current and deferred tax 2.3 charges or credits in the year which together make up the total tax charge or credit it simple Taxation in the income statement, a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax charge for the period and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income and directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transactions.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
The calculation of the Groups tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be fully determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due, which require judgement.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves judgement regarding the timing and level of future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group has the right of set-off.

expectations held when the related provision was made.
Where the outcome is more favourable than the provision made, the difference is released, lowering the current year tax charge.
Where the outcome is less favourable than our Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur.
This year there is no net impact of prior year adjustments and the Group has the right of set-off.
The current tax charge includes a 10 million credit relating to prior years, and the deferred tax credit includes an equal and opposite 10 million charge.
The impact of overseas tax rates reflects the fact that some of our profits are earned in territories other than the UK, and taxed at rates different to the UK corporation tax rate.
This year losses arising in higher taxed jurisdictions, which we recognise through deferred tax, give rise to a reconciling benefit.
The UK corporation tax rate has been enacted to fall to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 this supersedes the originally enacted reduction to 18%.
The carrying value of UK temporary differences at the balance sheet date has been adjusted accordingly.
This has given rise to a charge of 5 million 2015: 1 million of which 1 million is recognised as a credit in the income statement and 6 million as a charge in other comprehensive income.
The Production tax credits included within the reconciliation above are UK High-End Television HETV tax credits and Childrens Television tax credits, which are part of a group of incentives provided to support the creative industries.
The ability to access these tax credits is fundamental when assessing the viability of investment decisions in the production of high-end drama and childrens programmes.
Under IFRS these production tax credits are reported within the total taxation charge in the income statement, however ITV considers them to be a contribution to production costs, and therefore working capital in nature, and excludes them from its adjusted tax charge, including them instead within Adjusted EBITA.
127 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 2: Results for the Year continued The effective tax rate is 18.1% 2015: 21.7%, and is the tax charge on the face of the income statement expressed as a percentage of the profit before tax.
In the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the effective tax rate is comparable to the standard rate of UK corporation tax 20% in 2016 and 20.25% in 2015.
As explained in the Financial and Performance Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to show how tax impacts total adjusted earnings in a way that is more aligned with the Groups cash tax position.
This year the current year movement on origination and reversal of temporary differences excluding exceptional items is a credit of 18 million, compared with a charge of 20 million in 2015.
The main reasons for this change are the recognition of tax losses in our overseas businesses, and the unwinding of deferred tax liabilities as intangible assets are amortised.
Taxation Other comprehensive income and equity As analysed in the table below, a deferred tax credit of 40 million on actuarial movements on pensions has been recognised in other comprehensive income.

131 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities In this This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
On the following pages section there are notes covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, acquisitions and disposals, provisions and pensions.
Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
Keeping Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through its 3.1 trading activity.
The Group therefore defines working capital as distribution rights, it simple Working programme rights and production costs, trade and other receivables and trade and capital other payables.
Careful management of working capital ensures that the Group can meet its trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle.
Working capital is a driver of the profit to cash conversion ratio, a key performance indicator for the Group.
The Groups target profit to cash ratio on a rolling three-year basis is at least 90%.
For those subsidiaries acquired during the year, working capital at the date of acquisition is excluded from the profit to cash calculation so that only subsequent working capital movements in the period owned by ITV are reflected in this metric.
In the following section you will find further information regarding working capital management and analysis of the elements of working capital.

Programme rights and production costs not yet utilised are included in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In assessing net realisable value for programmes in production, judgement is required when considering the contracted sales price and estimated costs to complete.
Broadcast programme rights Acquired programme rights which include films, and sports rights, are purchased for the primary purpose of broadcasting on the ITV Family channels, including VOD and SVOD platforms.
These are recognised within current assets as payments are made or when the rights are ready for broadcast.
The Group generally expenses these rights through operating costs over a number of transmissions reflecting the pattern and value in which the right is consumed.
Commissions, which primarily comprise programmes purchased based on editorial specification and over which the Group has some control, are recognised in current assets as payments are made and are generally expensed to operating costs in full on first transmission.
Where a commission is repeated on any platform, incremental costs associated with the broadcast are included in operating costs.
In assessing net realisable value for acquired and commissioned rights, the net realisable value assessment is based on estimated airtime value, with consideration given to whether the number of transmissions purchased can be efficiently played out over the licence period.

Where payments are not due for more than one year, they are shown in the financial statements at their net present value to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment.
The Group provides goods and services to substantially all its customers on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience, the current state of the UK and overseas economies and industry specific factors.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
During the year 35 million of trade receivable invoices were sold under a receivables purchase agreement see note 4.2 for more details.

equipment The cost of these assets is the amount initially paid for them.
A depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time.
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used useful economic life.
If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the Directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below their depreciated value.
If an assets value falls below its depreciated value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific estimates made in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires judgement as to whether substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to the Group.
Estimates used by management in making this assessment include the useful economic life of assets, the fair value of the asset and the discount rate applied to the total payments required under the lease.
Assets held under such leases are included within property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease on an effective interest basis.
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term see note 2.1 for further details of operating lease commitments.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life.
The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: Asset class Depreciation policy Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 60 years Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life Vehicles, equipment and fittings 3 to 20 years Equipment includes studio production and technology assets.

it simple Intangible assets These assets include formats and brands, customer contracts and relationships, contractual arrangements, licences, software development, film libraries and goodwill.
The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights.
In the case of goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired.
The value of goodwill is intangible value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong market position and the outstanding productivity of its employees.
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the number of years the Group expects to use the asset, the useful economic life, via an annual amortisation charge to the income statement.
Where there has been a technological change or decline in business performance the Directors review the value of assets, including goodwill, to ensure they have not fallen below their amortised value.
Should an assets value fall below its amortised value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
This section explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen as a result of business combinations.
Goodwill is stated at its recoverable amount being cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to the business to which it relates.
Due to changes in accounting standards goodwill has been calculated using three different methods depending on the date the relevant business was purchased.
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using the acquisition method.
Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognition of any part of the business not yet owned non-controlling interests, less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration expected to be transferred in the future will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and recognised within other payables.
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash flows.
The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate.
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and call and put options are granted over the remaining interest, a non-controlling interest is initially recognised in equity at fair value, which is established based on the value of the put option.
A call option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, carried at fair value.
The put option is recognised as a liability within other payables, carried at the present value of the put option exercise price, and a corresponding charge is included in merger and other reserves.
Any subsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is recognised within finance income or cost.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of the acquisition date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date.
These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, are expensed as incurred.

The value of goodwill is intangible value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong market position Other intangible assets and the outstanding productivity of its employees.

budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates, operating costs and the expected useful lives of assets.
Judgements are also made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be renewed: this drives our amortisation policy for those assets.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or businesses being acquired.
139 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are judged to be indefinite.
Indefinite life assets, such as goodwill, are not amortised but are tested for impairment at each year end.
Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible assets has any indication of impairment requires judgement.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment test is performed by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill, the cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units related to the goodwill.
Total assets which include goodwill are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating unit or CGU.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset.
In testing for impairment, estimates are used in deriving cash flows and the discount rates.
Such estimates reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to the asset and the time value of money.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with long-term forecasting.
If different estimates of the projected future cash flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were made, these changes could materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections: long-term growth rates: and a pre-tax market discount rate.
Cash flow projections are based on the Groups current five-year plan.
Beyond the five-year plan these projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate of 2% 2015: 2%.
The growth rate used is consistent with the long-term average growth rates for both the industry and the countries in which they are located and is appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The discount rate has been revised for each CGU to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium and the net cost of debt.
There is currently no reasonably possible change in discount rate that would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.
141 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued Broadcast & Online The goodwill in this CGU arose as a result of the acquisition of broadcasting businesses since 1999, the largest of which was the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc, which was treated as an acquisition of Carlton for accounting purposes.
Broadcast & Online goodwill also includes the goodwill arising on acquisition of UTV Limited in February 2016.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow projections for this CGU are based include: the share of the television advertising market: share of commercial impacts: programme and other costs: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of the television advertising market.
In forming its assumptions about the television advertising market, the Group has used a combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates, which place greater emphasis on recent experience.
Also as part of the impairment review, a sensitivity of up to -10% was applied to 2017 and -3% to 2018 with no subsequent recovery, again with no impairment identified.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
An impairment charge of 2,309 million was recognised in the Broadcast & Online CGU in 2008, as a result of the downturn in the short-term outlook for the advertising market.
The advertising market has substantially improved since then however the impairment cannot be reversed.
The impairment review set out above results in significant headroom in excess of the 2008 impairment amount.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 10.4% 2015: 9.7% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
SDN Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN the licence operator for DTT Multiplex A in 2005.
It represented the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the Group, principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and additional capacity available from 2010.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are: income to be earned from medium-term contracts: the market price of available multiplex video streams: and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of current contract terms, recent market transactions and in-house estimates of video stream availability and pricing.
As part of the impairment review, sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified 2017: -10% growth, 2018: 0% growth.
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in the income and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.7% 2015: 11.5% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
ITV Studios The goodwill for ITV Studios has arisen as a result of the acquisition of production businesses since 1999.
Significant balances were created from the acquisition by Granada of United News and Medias production businesses in 2000 and the merger of Granada and Carlton in 2004 to form ITV plc.
ITV Studios goodwill also includes all of the goodwill arising from recent acquisitions since 2012, with the largest acquisitions being Leftfield in 2014, followed by Talpa and Twofour Group in 2015.
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows for the whole CGU were based include revenue including international revenue and the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions and hours produced, margins and the pre-tax market discount rate.
These assumptions have been determined by using a combination of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house estimates of growth rates in all markets.
As part of the impairment review sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment identified 2017: -10% growth, 2018: 0% growth.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.6% 2015: 10.1% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
There have been no changes to the ITV Studios CGU in the year and the Directors consider that a single ITV Studios CGU continues to remain appropriate.

In addition, we have placed text boxes to explain some of the technical terms used in the disclosure.
What are the Groups pension schemes?
There are two types of pension schemes.
A Defined Contribution scheme that is open to ITV employees, and a number of Defined Benefit schemes that have been closed to new members since 2006 and will close to future accrual in 2017.
In 2016 on acquisition of UTV Limited the Group took over the UTV Defined Benefit Scheme.
What is a Defined Contribution scheme?
The Defined Contribution scheme is where the Group makes fixed payments into a separate fund on behalf of those employees that have elected to participate in saving for their retirement.
ITV has no further obligation to the participating employee and the risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the Group.
It is the members responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
What is a Defined Benefit scheme?
In a Defined Benefit scheme, members receive cash payments during retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service.
The Group makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial position.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the Scheme and its funding position.
The Trustee, appointed according to the terms of the Schemes documentation, is required to act in the best interest of the members and is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the scheme and its funding position.
In the event of poor returns the Group needs to address this through a combination of increased levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the scheme.
Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments.
Accounting policies Defined contribution scheme Obligations under the Groups defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
For 2016, total contributions expensed were 16 million 2015: 16 million.
Defined benefit scheme The Groups obligation in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme the Scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future retirement benefit that eligible employees members have earned in return for their services.
That benefit payable in the future is discounted to todays value and then the fair value of scheme assets is deducted to measure the defined benefit pension deficit.
The liabilities of the Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid using the projected unit method.
This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes allowance for projected earnings of members in the future up to retirement.

The areas that impact the defined benefit obligation the pension scheme liabilities it simple position at the year end are as follows: Current service cost the cost to the Group of the future benefits earned by members that relates to the members service in the current year.
This is charged to operating costs in the income statement.
Past service cost is a change in present value of the benefits built up by the members in the prior periods: can be positive or negative resulting from changes to the existing plan as a result of an agreement between ITV and employees or as a result of significant reduction by ITV in the number of employees covered by the plan curtailment.
Interest cost the pension obligations payable in the future are discounted to the present value at year end.
A discount factor is used to determine the current value today of the future cost.
The interest cost is the unwinding of one years movement in the present value of the obligation.
It is broadly determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by the updated present value of the obligation during the period.
The discount rate is a key assumption explained later in this section.
This interest cost is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement see note 4.4.
Actuarial gains or losses there are broadly two causes of actuarial movements.
Experience adjustments, which arise when comparing assumptions made when estimating the liabilities and what has actually occurred, and adjustments resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions e. g. movements in corporate bond yields.
Key assumptions are explained in detail later in this section.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised through other comprehensive income.

it simple What are the pension Scheme assets?
At 31 December 2016 the Schemes assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities.
The tables below set out the major categories of assets.
Financial instruments are in place in order to provide protection against changes in market factors interest rates and inflation which could act to increase the defined benefit pension deficit.
These financial instruments are classified as Scheme assets.
One such instrument is the longevity swap which the Scheme transacted in 2011 to obtain protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of pensioner members at that date.
Under the swap, the Trustee agreed to make pre-determined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live.
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in the Scheme assets.
The swap had a nil valuation at inception and, using market-based assumptions, is subsequently adjusted for changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates, in line with its fair value.
How do we measure the pension Scheme assets?
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following: Interest income on scheme assets this is determined by multiplying the fair value of the Scheme assets by the discount rate, both taken as of the beginning of the year.
This is recognised through net financing costs in the income statement.
Return on assets arise from differences between the actual return and interest income on Scheme assets and are recognised through other comprehensive income.
Employers contributions are paid into the Scheme to be managed and invested.
Benefits and administrative expenses paid out by the Schemes will lower the fair value of the Schemes assets.
The movement in the fair value of the defined benefit schemes assets is analysed below: 2016 2015 m m Fair value of Scheme assets at 1 January 3,270 3,341 Interest income on Scheme assets 126 116 Return loss on assets, excluding interest income 416 126 Employer contributions 93 102 UTV acquisition 98 Benefits paid 165 158 Administrative expenses paid 5 5 Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 3,833 3,270 The actual return on the Schemes assets, being the sum of the interest income on Scheme assets and return on Scheme assets, for the year ended 31 December 2016 was an increase of 542 million 2015: decrease of 10 million.

It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may it simple have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position.
This sensitivity to change is analysed below to demonstrate how small changes in assumptions can have a large impact on the estimation of the defined benefit pension deficit.
The Trustee manages the investment, mortality and inflation risks to ensure the pension obligations are met as they fall due.
The investment strategy is aimed at the valuation obligation rather than IAS19 defined pension deficit value.
As such the effectiveness of the risk hedging strategies on a valuation basis will not be the same as on an accounting basis.
Those hedging strategies have significant impact on the movement in the net pension deficit as assumptions change, offsetting the impacts on the obligation disclosed below.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of Scheme assets, which may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
Changes in assumptions have a different level of impact as the value of the net pension deficit fluctuates, because the relationship between them is not linear.
The analysis below considers the impact of a single change in principal assumptions on the defined benefit obligation while keeping the other assumptions unchanged and does not take into account any risk hedging strategies: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 65 million Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% Increase by 75 million Increase by 0.1% Increase by 15 million Rate of inflation Retail Price Index Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 15 million Increase by 0.1% Increase by 10 million Rate of inflation Consumer Price Index Decrease by 0.1% Decrease by 10 million Life expectations Increase by one year Increase by 130 million The sensitivity analysis has been determined by extrapolating the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the year end with changes in key assumptions that might reasonably occur.
While the Schemes risk hedging strategy is aimed at a valuation basis, the Directors estimate that on an accounting basis it would significantly reduce the above impact on the defined benefit obligation.
In particular, an increase in assumption of life expectations by one year would benefit from an estimated increase of the value of the longevity swap by 100 million, reducing the net impact on the defined pension deficit to 30 million.
Further, the ITV Pension Scheme invests in UK Government bonds and interest rate and inflation swap contracts and therefore movements in the defined benefit obligation are typically offset, to an extent, by asset movements.
This occurred during 2016 when both corporate and UK government bond yields fell significantly and the market expectation of future inflation rose.
However, as corporate bond yields fell further than UK Government Bond yields, the impact on the defined benefit obligation exceeded the impact on the assets.

The reduction in normal employer contributions for current service is as a result of the closure of the ITV Pension Scheme to future benefit accrual.
The Group has two asset-backed pension funding agreements with the Trustee and makes annual payments of 11 million for 12 years from 2011 and 2.5 million, increasing by 5% per annum until 2038.

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
In this case, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the income statement in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
161 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs continued Determining Fair Value The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our current creditworthiness, as well as that of our swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Groups interest rate derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations between inputs.
How do we manage our currency and interest rate risk?
Currency risk As the Group expands its international operations, the performance of the business becomes increasingly sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue at the time of commitment for up to five years forward.
The Group also hedges a proportion of highly probable non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue on a rolling 18-month basis see Keeping it simple box for explanation of non-functional currency transactions.
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency denominated cash balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps both to manage foreign currency cash flow timing differences and to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary items.
The Groups net investments in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is considered to be material.
In 2015 the Group designated a portion of its euro borrowings into a net investment hedge against its euro denominated assets following the acquisition of Talpa Media.
The following table highlights the Groups sensitivity to translation risk resulting from a 10% strengthening weakening in sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables are held constant: 2016 post- 2015 posttax profit 2016 equity tax profit 2015 equity US dollar 3 million 32 million 10 million 63 million Euro 10 million 11 million 8 million 41 million The Groups sensitivity to translation risk for revenue and adjusted EBITA is disclosed in the Financial and Performance Review on page 44.
The key difference between the foreign currency sensitivity for adjusted EBITA and profit after tax is the impact on the US dollar and euro denominated exceptional costs, including acquisition related costs, acquired intangible amortisation and net financing cost.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate policy is to allow fixed rate gross debt to vary between 20% and 100% of total gross debt to accommodate floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
At 31 December 2016 the Groups fixed rate debt represented 92% of total gross debt 2015: 99%.
Consequently a 1% movement in interest rates on floating rate debt would impact the 2016 post-tax profit for the year by 2 million 2015: nil.
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the movements in the year relating to changes in fair value and interest are not separated.

ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
Level 1 Fair values are measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Fair values are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at the difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date.
